font-size: large; color: #0000ff;">Transcribed by Connie O'Brien</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> I’d like to welcome everyone on BBS Internet Radio.&nbsp; We</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are on the air so I am formally welcoming everybody from BBS</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Radio as well as everyone on the conference call.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> We welcome everyone listening on our replay lines and our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">audio downloads, and everyone who is live who has taken the time</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this evening to be with us this 4th of July, (2011).&nbsp; Some people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were wondering whether we’re going to do a call, and here we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are.&nbsp; Someday we’re going to take a vacation, and then we’ll</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">play some of the replays; but for the moment we’re still</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">running strong.&nbsp; I don’t know if anyone is listening for the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">first time tonight.&nbsp; We’ll probably have a small listenership. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Did you guys read the topic for tonight?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gina:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; What was the topic tonight, Gina?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gina:</strong>&nbsp; Why Independence Day is called Independence Day and the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">meaning behind that, I believe.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Wrong.&nbsp; That’s not what it said.&nbsp; It says, “Why is the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Declaration of Independence like the Law of One?”</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gina:</strong>&nbsp; Okay, I stand corrected then.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Don’t feel bad about it.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; I’d be interested in the answer!</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I sent out a picture of the first copy of the Declaration</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of Independence, at least the first page of it.&nbsp; It’s really</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">interesting because it’s all crossed out and it’s the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">original worksheet they had.&nbsp; It says, “When in the course of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">political bands which have connected them with another and to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">come and to assume among the powers of the earth separate and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">equal station to which the laws of nature and nature’s God</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">entitles them, a decent respect of the opinions of mankind</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">take separation.&nbsp; We hold these truths to be self-evident that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Creator with inherent, inalienable rights, that among these are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">rights governments are instituted amongst men, deriving their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">just powers from the consent of the governed, (and) that whenever</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the right of he people to alter or to abolish it.”</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Isn’t that interesting?&nbsp; “We hold these truths to be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">self-evident that all men are created equal.”&nbsp; Interestingly</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">enough, I’m not going to tell you the answer to this. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’m going to read a couple of things here.&nbsp; Those of you that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have paid attention to our work; I don’t talk about this often.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;[This is because] I like to talk about Terry being St.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Catherine; it’s kind of like I’m saying she was St. Catherine</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and she can handle it without any self-aggrandizement. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">When you were somebody in a past life, in most cases it’s just</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">as good that you didn’t know who you were.&nbsp; In some cases if</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’re really working on yourself, it’s good to know things</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you did so that you can learn from how a pattern got established</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in a past life; but, you don’t need to know your past life to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">know about the pattern.&nbsp; What happens is, the pattern gets</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">repeated in this life, and it comes in and something or someone</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">triggers the pattern.&nbsp; So, you don’t need to know how it got</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">triggered in a past life, you can learn about it from this life. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The problem with patterns is that most people don’t realize</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they have a pattern; they think it’s them.&nbsp; I remember when I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was growing up, when I was young – it felt like that’s who I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was.&nbsp; I didn’t know I was all screwed up, or as some of you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have heard about my father or this or that – the things that I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">internalized.&nbsp; It feels like you.&nbsp; One of the things that it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">really good know is that it’s not you; no matter what the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">pattern is, it’s not you.&nbsp; It’s a pattern, it’s a pattern</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that keeps you from being you.&nbsp; It keeps you thinking you’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not loved; it keeps you thinking that you’re not worthy.&nbsp; Many</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">times these patterns have been imposed upon you by other people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in other lifetimes.&nbsp; Once the pattern gets set you keep running</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it and you keep attracting people to support that pattern.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">takes a lot of self-observation to first identify a pattern and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">second to observe it and third to release it.&nbsp; It doesn’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">usually happen quickly, as many of you know.&nbsp; The patterns are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">very deeply set.&nbsp; Even when you know that you feel unworthy and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you know that’s not you, you’re still not able shift it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">easily.&nbsp; There are ways to shift it over time, and one of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">ways I think is coming into these conference calls and coming</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">into our calls and studying this kind of material, because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there’s an energy on the line that helps lift people above the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">patterns and then there is certain wisdom that allows you to look</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">at yourself and release your patterns.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">About three years ago I did a workshop called “The Egyptian</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Connection”.&nbsp; In that workshop I shared all the things that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">seemed to tie me to an Egyptian Pharaoh whose name was Akhnaton. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Historically, that pharaoh is known as ‘the heretic pharaoh’,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because he did something very, very controversial and he had a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">really difficult time of it.&nbsp; If you’re aware of Egypt, you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">know that Egyptians have many gods.&nbsp; Akhnaton, according to Carla</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Rueckert, was talking to Ra, one of the few people in history</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that Ra was communicating to.&nbsp; His wife was Nefertiti.&nbsp; As a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">result of talking to Ra, or communications from Ra however they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">came to him, he came to the conclusion that the Law of One was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the way things were, and that Egypt was being run by the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">negative.&nbsp; At the time, the priests were using their connection</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with all these gods to control people.&nbsp; They were doing</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sacrifices, they were doing all kinds of things that the negative</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">does today in secret societies.&nbsp; In fact, they were the Egyptian</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">version of it; but, they weren’t secret societies, they were</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">openly running the country.&nbsp; So, this pharaoh outlawed them;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">said, “No more.&nbsp; We can’t have this worship of these negative</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">gods.” </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">He became rather unpopular; he was very popular for a while, then</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">he became unpopular.&nbsp; He was causing a lot of people to lose</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">their jobs, and not make money; also, he was doing things that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were for the best interests of the spiritual evolution of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">planet, as opposed to what was best for the political needs of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Egypt.&nbsp; He was pharaoh, and he was supposed directing the armies</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and doing all the head of state thing, and he was doing something</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">else.&nbsp; Eventually he moved the people who were his followers to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">their own city about two hundred miles outside of the capital of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Egypt which was Thebes. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">As I was studying this – I’m not going to tell the whole</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">story, I have a workshop called ‘The Egyptian Connection’ and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’ll tell you where to get that workshop.&nbsp; It’s a four-hour</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">workshop and it is very profound.&nbsp; There were a number of things</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that would tie me to Akhnaton when this first started, and it was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">very hard to believe it.&nbsp; It was also, the whole episode was so</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">out-there, so science fiction-y.&nbsp; One of the things was I was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">getting dream messages.&nbsp; This was in 2002, and I had a voice</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">talking to me in my dreams and was looking over my shoulder and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">giving me wise guidance.&nbsp; First I thought I was making it up; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">had Daphne having the Elohim talking to me, I had voices talking</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to me in my dreams, and of course I was writing the book about</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Wilcock, The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce.&nbsp; When I asked in a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">channeling, I said “Who is talking to me in my dreams?”&nbsp; They</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">said “Akhnaton”.&nbsp; And, I said “and Ra?”&nbsp; They said</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“Under the auspices of Ra.”&nbsp; Then I said, “Did I know</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Akhnaton?”&nbsp; And they said, “You were his right-hand man.” </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Then I said, “What was my name?”&nbsp; And they said</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“Amenhotep.”&nbsp; I went on the internet and I wanted to see if I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">could find a picture or a statue of myself, I was looking for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">validation of this.&nbsp; I found out that Amenhotep was the name for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Akhnaton before he changed his name. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">If you want to understand the Egyptian terminology of the time,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">‘Amen’ was the name of the lower god; also the moon god.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was the god that the priests were worshipping and all the other</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Egyptian gods were subsets of that, Osiris and I don’t even</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">know their names.&nbsp; And ‘Aten’ was the sun god, and that was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the god that Akhnaton was pointed towards.&nbsp; His name</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">‘Amenhotep’ – ‘Amen’ represented the moon god and the </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">previous three pharaohs were named ‘Amen’ – Amenhotep I,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">II, III, IV and he changed his name to ‘Akhnaton’, which was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the sun god. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">When I asked in a channeling who is talking to me in my dreams,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and they said I was his right-hand man and then they said my name</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was Amenhotep I kept studying this.&nbsp; I said to myself, “Why</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">would Akhnaton have a right-hand man with the same name that he</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">changed?”&nbsp; In other words, Amenhotep was the lower god form. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">As I put it together and put it together, eventually I found out</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Daphne had a very striking similarity to the statue of Nefertiti</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and Nefertiti was Akhnaton’s wife.&nbsp; This was in 2002 and I was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">researching for the book I was writing, The Reincarnation of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Edgar Cayce.&nbsp; I was at the Bodi Tree, the metaphysical bookstore,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and I was in the Edgar Cayce section.&nbsp; I was buying books to try</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to write the book I was writing and put things together.&nbsp; There</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was a book that was misplaced and it was called My Son Ikhnaton. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I said, “I’m going to buy this and read it and see if it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">brings any clues into this story.”&nbsp; As I read it and I was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">particularly reading the character of Nefertiti, I knew that was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Daphne.&nbsp; It was after that that I looked her picture up and saw</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that she was the same as the Egyptian bust of Nefertiti.&nbsp; This</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was a channeled book, it wasn’t a historical book.&nbsp; Somebody</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">channeled it and it was Akhnaton’s mother who was speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There was another book called Born of the Sun – the story of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Akhenaton.&nbsp; about this history of Akhnaton – by the way, this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is also a channeled book, also Akhnaton’s mother speaking. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There was a very interesting thing about these two books, because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there was a villain negative priest named Akenset and the same</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">priest was referred to in both books, but never appeared in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Google.&nbsp; When I looked up Akenset, there was no historical</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reference to Akenset and I thought that was a very strange –</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not a coincidence because at the point I believed both books had</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the same channeled source.&nbsp; At the time it struck me and gave</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">certain validity to these books. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Let me tell you a little bit more about Akhnaton before I go</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">through that.&nbsp; Akhnaton lived 1300 BC approximately; eventually</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">his city was destroyed and (there was) a bit of mystery as to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what happened to his body and what happened to Nefertiti’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">body.&nbsp; In these channeled books, there was an assignment that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Akhnaton was doing under the request, I assume, of the Ra group. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">He was inspiring, making the environment for, souls to become</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Christed in this city.&nbsp; What Christed means is knowing how to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">live and express the Law of One.&nbsp; The Law of One means that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’re me and I’m you, and we’re here in this temporary</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">separation of my body and your body.&nbsp; He was creating</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">environments for people to experience the Law of One in a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">community where they were living together. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">According to this book, there were about one hundred people that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">he succeeded with and he sent them out of the city.&nbsp; He had to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sneak them out; they had to go with the Hebrews because the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">priests didn’t want this to happen and they would have been</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">killed.&nbsp; A hundred people who were able to live in the Law of One</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">left his city and they started living in the caves somewhere</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">around there; I don’t where, I can’t remember where.&nbsp; There</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was a specific function for these hundred people, because they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were to create a very high vibration unity in these caves.&nbsp; Of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">course, they passed it onto their children; the high souls came</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">into that group.&nbsp; This was all a plan of the Ra group. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">You want to understand how the Ra group works; they make plans</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">when they work with this realm, making attempts of lifting the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">vibration here.&nbsp; This group of people became known historically</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">as the Essenes and when Jesus was brought into this realm –</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Jesus needed a high vibration community to grow up in so that he</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">could hold the high energy that he was meant to hold.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Essenes were that community, and that was all started with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Akhnaton. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’ll give a plug here on my workshop; it’s called</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><a href="http://www.egypt.messageaday.net">www.egypt.messageaday.net</a>.&nbsp; Some of you have had Egyptian</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">incarnations, and if you have when you listen to this workshop</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it’s going to trigger you right into a really deep</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">understanding because you can start to see how the Ra group works</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and interfaces with this realm and creates situations and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">circumstances that can allow the kind of evolution required so</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that people can graduate. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I just have these two books here – don’t worry I’m going to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">get to July 4th.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Quote from Born of the Sun, the Story of Akhenaton by Ehrton, 1st</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Books Library:</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“This group spoke a language which is known as Aramaic. They</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">did not remain isolated in the Dead Sea but formed compounds in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Palestine where they cloistered and lived holy lives.&nbsp; They were</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">known as the Essenes.&nbsp; When Jesus was about to appear, many</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reincarnated in Palestine to form a protective ring around the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">child.&nbsp; The three Magi who travelled afar to bring gifts and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">honor him were ancient souls.&nbsp; The many who occupied the Essene</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">compounds where Jesus found protection and comfort were among</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">them.&nbsp; By that time there were thousands, but always the original</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">fifty men and fifty women returned to hold the light.&nbsp; Akhenaton</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reincarnated as the high priest, Occsi, of the Temple of the Sun</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in Heliopolis, which welcomed the child with his parents as they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were led to Egypt.&nbsp; There he received his early training and was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">finally Christed at that spot.&nbsp; Tyi reincarnated as Judith, head</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of the Essenes.&nbsp; (Tyi was Akhnaton’s mother.)&nbsp; She and Occsi</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">worked very closely in Jesus’ early training and eventual</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Christhood, and the dissemination of his teachings in the early</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">churches. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Not only did the early faithful incarnate to form a protective</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">link around Jesus, but have done so at subsequent times in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">history.&nbsp; The time of King Arthur was one; the Hueggenots of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">France, the early formation of the United States of America are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">only some of the most noted.&nbsp; They not only hold the light in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">bodily form during crucial times, but also carry a collective</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">consciousness that holds the Light for others from spirit during</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">incarnate period.” </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">And then it goes on to say here: “The soul of Akhenaton walks</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the earth at this time, not in one body but in 60, each carrying</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a facet of his mission.” </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Actually the guy that wrote this book believes he is one of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">60.&nbsp; He and I have sat together and talked about this. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“They have come from the future folding back time to building</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the City of Light at Akhetaton.”&nbsp; Now this is interesting –</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“Though Jesus …will walk among us, the Second Coming of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Christ is Us.”&nbsp; That was from the book Born of the Sun.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Now the other book was called My Son Ikhnaton.&nbsp; In that book it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">says “Ikhnaton lives in the earth today; Ikhnaton accompanies</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">those who walk in their journeys of light and those who seek to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">give light to men once again.&nbsp; Ikhnaton will seal his lips as to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">his light; he will give light in what he is now speaking, not of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Ikhnaton of the past nor of other bodies in the past. He will</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">recognize …the faces of those he knew in Egyptian days.&nbsp; In</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this Ikhnaton will be similar to the sphinx, who—now this is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not me, I don’t feel this way but I’ll read it—who</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">inscrutably knowing, all-wise and unspeaking, will resolve Light</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and his going into the Eternal Way. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">From the past, Ikhnaton will be drawn the great reservoirs of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">strength he used before, and then once again will begin to know</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">light, for into Ikhnaton’s hands in the earth today has been</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">given a key;&nbsp; he’s fast approaching the time of unlocking the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">mystery within his mind, light and heart.&nbsp; He will reveal once</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">again the scrolls of the memories between the two ages.&nbsp; This</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">will enable them to climb upward beyond the historical into the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">spiritual.”</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">If all that sounds interesting and you want to hear the whole</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">story, go to www.egypt.messageaday.net.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’m just going to say one thing but I’m not going to tell the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">whole story.&nbsp; I’m going to leave you all with a question. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Maybe we’ll go into some discussion with our sources through</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Terry about this.&nbsp; I guess about two years ago, out of the clear</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">blue sky, Daphne or Terry said the reason I chose to incarnate in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Philadelphia, which is where I was born, is because I was one of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the founders of the country.&nbsp; When I was young I worked in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">downtown Philadelphia at an electronics store and once a week I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">would go to Independence Hall and stare at it. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I asked them, “Who was I?”&nbsp; They said they wouldn’t tell</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">me; I had to figure it out.&nbsp; I did figure it out.&nbsp; There was no</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">doubt in my mind when I read their story carefully, that I had to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have been that person.&nbsp; I’m not going to tell you who it is;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you can email me.&nbsp; If you get the right person, I might say,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“Yes.”&nbsp; I never told this story publicly and I’m always a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">little bit hesitant about identifying with somebody who is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">famous.&nbsp; I told you that much – it was just very interesting</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because they said that people were going to come back and be the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">founders of this country.&nbsp; And then, they told me I was a founder</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of a country and I do look like the guy.&nbsp; Go look up the founders</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and see who I look like. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There was a very high intent in the creation of this country to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">create an environment of freedom, of checks and balances, of a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Constitution of ways that the government could not abuse power</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">between the three power sources:&nbsp; the Congress, the President and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Yet here we are, and it seems like it’s all</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">falling to pieces.&nbsp; That’s good, I guess, because maybe if it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">truly falls to pieces something will rise out of it.&nbsp; Before I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">risk sticking my foot in my mouth and saying anything I’ll be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sorry for later – Terry, are you ready?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I’m going to ask questions that I’ve never asked, I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">don’t know what they’re going to say.&nbsp; We’ll see what</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">happens, just for the highest good of all concerned:</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the light to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">surround and protect every person on this line, every person</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">listening, Terry and myself – and any negativity be taken to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the higher realms of light and transmuted for the highest good of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">all concerned.&nbsp; We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">from the center of the Universe through the galaxies, through our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">galaxy, through the planets, through the earth, through our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">bodies and into the center of the earth.&nbsp; Right now we invoke a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">group energy connection while honoring the individuality of each</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of our souls.&nbsp; We invite those sources that positive, service to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">others, honoring the Law of One to join with us while we create a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">protected space that only the positive has access to and anything</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not of that nature must leave now.&nbsp; Do we have our sources</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">present?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Creator.&nbsp; This is Ra’An and we are here on this 4th of July</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">2011 moving through Terry Brown and Wynn Free from Sedona</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Arizona.&nbsp; We greet each and every person on BBS Radio and the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">individuals on the telephone call.&nbsp; It is our delight to make</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">contact, and we appreciate each and every one of you.&nbsp; Do you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Why don’t I open it carte blanche here for you to share</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">anything you want about what I just said, and about the founding</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of our country.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; We take a look at the country and we see</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that many of the individuals who are responsible for the founding</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of the country still have responsibility and take care to bring</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">responsibility to government, and there are many on the sidelines</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">working in their own ways to bring stability to the country and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">working as light workers to bring through honor and truth. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">We also see that you were working very closely with Akhnaton, and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were sharing space with Akhnaton in that lifetime and that much</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of what you read in the book today is correct.&nbsp; Akhnaton is as</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the segments of him in the countries are alive today and working</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to bring responsibility to government and more than one of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">segments of Akhnaton were founding fathers of the country.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It is a great celebration today and we see a revival of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">force, the life energy force, towards responsibility in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">government and toward the regeneration of life force within the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">country of the United States.&nbsp; We experience the fervor with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">which so many people celebrate the 4th of July and remember the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">country.&nbsp; It is a renewed energy and it is heartening to see.&nbsp; Do</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you have questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> The story of Akhnaton talked about him in that book</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">dividing into sixty separate souls after that.&nbsp; That was the very</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">first time I ever heard of someone dividing into separate souls. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Could you explain a little about that?&nbsp; Is there a master soul</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that oversees all the individual souls?&nbsp; Are they all equal in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">their connection?&nbsp; And, why did that occur?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; There is a master soul that has not been discovered yet</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in the Akhnaton energy, and you are in touch with him and helping</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">him and he is helping you.&nbsp; There are other souls that have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">broken off, and he is also working through them and is helping</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">them as they are helping him. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There was a synergy that was developed over millions of years of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sharing the same energy, the same purpose, the same goals, the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">same space.&nbsp; There was a time when his soul originally as</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">separate ones came together for a purpose of furthering the Law</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of One.&nbsp; They, in the time of Akhnaton and after, began to seek</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">their own separate energy still working for the Law of One.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Was Akhnaton an embodiment of the master soul or was he a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">fragment of it?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Akhnaton was an embodiment of the whole soul that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">consisted of these individuals who had gotten together in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">name of the Law of One to work toward the betterment of mankind</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and to work responsibility together under the Law of One.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So it’s not like Akhnaton split into 60, he was already</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a combination of the 60 that were all working through him.&nbsp; Is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that what I understood?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> That is correct.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; But they didn’t continue operating together, they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">continued operating separately thereafter.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Right – but the energy is still tied very closely</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">together.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong> So in the Declaration of Independence, were there a number</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of people who were embodying the Akhnaton soul energy who were</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">participants in writing that?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; There were participants that were embodying the soul</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy of Akhnaton in the founders of the country; they came</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">together as they were attracted towards the founding of the Union</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and thought that it would be a chance to put into effect a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">country wherein people could practice their own freedoms and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">could embody the unification that they had so long held as an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">ideal where an individual might be free. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">As far as the signing of the Declaration of Independence: there</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were many that contributed but not all that signed and we see</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">only a couple that had embodied the fragments, that embodied and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">had moved on the track along with the group with Akhnaton.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Is it a common thing to have a person have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">many souls joined together for a significant lifetime?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> It is not generally known; however it is common in not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">usually such men of magnitude that join together.&nbsp; There are some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that join together out of common misfortune.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> When souls join together for a common purpose like that,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">would the negative also do that sometimes?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; The negative can do that; however, it is more complex</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in the case of negative.&nbsp; It is more that individuals join</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">together through some misfortune and then become negative.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Like souls die in an explosion together or something like</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> That is correct.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; How about someone who is a great spiritual leader like</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Nelson Mandela or Martin Luther King or Gandhi – were they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">conglomerates of souls or were they individual souls?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> They were conglomerates; however not of the magnitude</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of Akhnaton, and not as many.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Different conglomerates.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; These individual souls have no memory of this, but they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have potentially access to the energies if they do the right</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">thing or they have the right synchronicities.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; If they are open to receiving knowledge; it is all</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">written in the Akashic Records, and it may be accessed but it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">takes one that is totally open to see it.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; In present time it seems like there’s aspects of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">American Dream, the American ‘Ethos’, the Intent – that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have become very distorted within the context of what some people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">call Secret Societies that are service-to-self that are behind</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">some of the negative things we see.&nbsp; How did we lose the original</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy-intent and have that come into place?&nbsp; When did that start</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to occur in the history of our country?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; It is a continuation within each individual as it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">brings to bear on the whole and the resultant is what you see. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It started in past history and became tempered by current</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">history. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Can we know in past history when that started?&nbsp; Did it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">start hundreds of years ago; did it start twenty years ago…?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; It started with the entry of souls into the physical</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">realm.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So it started at the beginning of creation?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; That is correct.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> It’s just been an ongoing balance between dark and light</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">throughout history?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes – and the balance between dark and light are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">harder to move through.&nbsp; There were periods, bands, so to say</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">when civilization became very advanced and also weaponry became</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">very advanced.&nbsp; The weaponry was then moved against the people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and it overwhelmed the people’s soul matrix and ability to move</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">freely.&nbsp; There were periods when this got very hard for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">individuals and periods where the darkness moved in, in the name</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of light.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; How can we fix all this now?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> It is fixed, by each individual observing themselves</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and learning the truth of themselves, the truth of their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">patterns, how they can get back to the original self before</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">picking up unwanted patterns and unwanted energies from others. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The self is a radiant being of beauty.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So basically, the reason the negative exists at</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">macro-level is because of the power that it’s given by each</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">individual?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> If enough individuals shift, the negative then dissipates?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes, it will lose its grip as individuals move into the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">truth, then the holding on of negativity will dissipate.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Okay.&nbsp; Well, I thank you very much for bringing those</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">clarifications forth tonight.&nbsp; Is there anything else to say</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">before we close this conversation?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; As we look across the United States we see great</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">celebrations and the bringing together of families.&nbsp; This often</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">happens during a time of holiday which then makes the country</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">stronger as individuals unite, communicate and get together and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">befriend again each other.&nbsp; This is the true strength within the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">country. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">We leave but we do not leave, and we thank you for this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">opportunity to be with you and each and each and every person who</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is connected or listening or hears this.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you very much.&nbsp; I just wanted to announce:&nbsp; I’ve</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">made the book The Creator Gods of the Physical Universe want to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Talk to You a free download, and you can download it at</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">www.creatorgodbook.com.&nbsp; If you haven’t read it, then please</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">do.&nbsp; If you have read it, please share that link and just tell</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people to read it.&nbsp; They’ll get on our list and for some people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it will make a big difference.&nbsp; Maybe we can get a million people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reading it and paying attention to this work – I’d like to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">put that thought out.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I thank Terry, I thank our sources and I thank everyone on the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">line.&nbsp; Happy 4th of July!</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gina:</strong> Thank you Wynn, thank you, Terry.&nbsp; Happy 4th of July.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>All:</strong>&nbsp; Bye, thank you, love to all.</span><br /><br /></p>
