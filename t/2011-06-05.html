We can't see it but we can develop spider senses and we can feel it with powerful intention. The universe has multi-dimensions attached to it. Much of what happens starts in other dimensions. Things happen and they transcend the laws of the physical realm like miraculous transformations. Many of us on the call feel this and each of you can choose to bring an area to put in the Light.</span></span></p>

We are mindful of things you put in the light. We send love light to the light workers on the planet and to each of the 200 scientists working on the reactors in Japan and to the Dolphins and to the Whales as we do this they pick up a love light and a wave of joy as it speaks through their populations and they are joyful at the connection of our group, your group, and Earth species as they hear our connection. We send light to teachers and students and all young people growing up become the leaders and take society in their reign. We send light to the economy and families that they may move out of the economic doldrums and there may be abundance for all especially free energy. We send light to the energy patterns and we work with Earth and work with farmers that can grow crops and the distribution systems may be strong and healthy to get food to everyone everywhere. We send love light to teens and 13-year-old boys becoming men and all teens who are becoming adults that they transition and become a healthy part of the world's dreams and goals. We connect with each and every person to Message-a-Day and those in the seat of information and all volunteers working to make this such a successful project. Our profound appreciation and thanks goes out that this information is being spread. We send healing to Danielle, and Eve. We send healing to each and every person on this line, Jean, Lisa, and each person whose healing they wish to accomplish. We support individuals and send love and light to Bridget for healing. We send love and light to the wildlife, animals, and the pets of the world that they may have a good connection with humans. We send love light to Cinda for healing of the whole body systems. We thank everyone for teamshift as it makes the connection stronger and strengthens the connection of people with the higher energies and life and makes available to them- it strengthens the people and the force. We put future relationships in the light and current relationships for joy to enter and for appreciation to enter for all the people with their gifts and communication that they get in relationships. We send love to the theater group of Michael that it raise the tone of those seeing the shows and brings lightheartedness to the viewers and participants. We send love light to Carolyn for her head, shoulder, leg, her whole body and she can return, as she is an activator for the students and teachers. We send love light to better relationships for all students and teachers. Lastly, we send love light that all the negativity that's not for the purpose of reestablishing a new better situation such as the plowing on a farm in the fall which equals a preparation for a new and better crop for next year. We send love and light that negativity be taken into the higher realms of light and transmuted and dissolved and that people may move out of the negativity and bring a better frame to themselves and relationships in a better more creative manner. We send love and light to each person who participates as this adds to the transformation of Earth to a better place more than you can imagine. We send you a magical day. Adonai.</span></span></p>
