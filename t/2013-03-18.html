This is our Monday night call; welcome to everybody that’s listening on the Internet and all of you that are listening on the conference lines and all of you that are listening on the replays.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I’ve got a really interesting topic tonight.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">For those of you that were on yesterdays’ conference call, our planetary healing session, I started talking about something, a really unusual topic. As you might know, I start these things and I start talking. I don’t know what I’m going to say; it kind of comes in the moment. I was talking about what I feel happens on our Sunday calls, because the Sunday calls are different than our other two calls and it’s developed over a long period of time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I’m learning things as this goes on, because I really don’t know what I’m doing. There’s nowhere to figure it out, so we just do things. I watch the results; I watch the impact on people and I try to explain to myself, “How is this working? What is going on here?” </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I’m trying to understand it just on the basis of what it is, not on the basis of what the Elohim say or the Ra group says, but using that as a certain reference point of wisdom and cosmic understanding. Nonetheless, I still have to integrate it on a personal level for it to be real to me.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I have this idea on our Sunday call and the way it’s evolved, that we are actually creating group energy. We’re creating something that exists in another dimension when we come on those calls, each of us, and it’s true on this call, too, but it’s not so directly focused on that. The Sunday call is focused on that. Every time we come together, there’s some aspect of group energy that’s developing.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I know that our Sources, these two group souls, have group energy. I’m trying to understand how they work, which is not easy, because I’m not there; I’m here; so I just listen, observe. They’re a big team that can come together and come and go apart; they can have councils. They can have sub-councils. When it’s required for them to operate as a team, they can choose to do that. When it’s best that they have individual delegation of things they can do that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">On some level the idea has come to me that on these calls, particularly our Sunday call, we are emulating a group soul in 3D, in the sense that we’re coming together and creating a group energy and the group energy, to fulfill the requirements of the highest good, the requirements of the highest truth, has to be of total free will.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Group energy doesn’t necessarily have to be positive; it can be negative. A group of people can come together to put intentions out for self-serving interests, so we have to create a group energy that doesn’t do that; that creates the intent for only positive, service-to-other things to come about. It also, on some level, has to have some benefit to us individually.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The way that I was explaining it yesterday is that on some level, it’s like we are building a reservoir of energy. I think our Sources are joining that reservoir, so even though we’re just a small group, there are millions and millions and millions of them, so that they have a certain amount of them, that they join that group energy with. We need to build the receiving antennae for that energy. It’s hard for one person to do it just as an individual; I don’t think it’s possible.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I don’t think I do it as an individual; I think I draw on that group energy just as well as you do. When there’s that reservoir there, an energy, it started out that it would come and then it would go and everyone would separate and we’d come back and we’d do it again and then everyone went back to their old form. In fact sometimes, a couple of years ago, I didn’t feel that energy come in until way into the call; we’d have to talk; we’d have to have fun; we’d have to laugh; we’d do whatever we’d do and suddenly there was a magic moment where something switched.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Now on the Sunday calls, I experience that it’s like a half hour before the call and I can feel the energy of the group coming together. The way I interpret that is that as the time of the call approaches, many of you have learned to feel that energy, and as soon as you start thinking about it before the call, you’re creating the intent and we’re starting to combine our energies before the call starts. So we are hitting the ground running, starting at a much higher point and building upon that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Of course, the time seems to go really fast when you’re in that experience. Now I’m sure some of you are listening and perhaps you haven’t had that experience yet. I will say, keep coming back, because maybe by talking about it, it helps you to understand what that experience is to look for. Because it’s not a normal human experience to do that, you don’t really have reference points to say, “This is like that” or “This is like this”; I don’t have reference points. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We’re learning as a group. I tell the people oftentimes on Sunday, even though I’m talking and I’m the center of attention, it’s not about me; it’s about us. I’m feeling the energy; I’m talking to the energy, or the energy is talking through me; I don’t know the right words.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I had this idea that the real culmination of this idea of a group energy which is in another dimension is on a human level that we start to have the experience of living inside of each other. Some of us are strangers and we feel that group energy; we don’t know you. You’re listening and you’re out in the environs somewhere, on the outskirts and yet you’re feeling the energy. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You’re participating in it and you’re part of the creation of it. Some of us are getting to know each other. Some time ago I felt the idea of getting to know each other was important because our human side really appreciates the experience of connecting with other people that understand the process. If you participated and experienced that group energy that happens when you get to know each other on a more personal level, you have a deeper connection and other people understand you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">One of the aspects of this came up in a conversation with somebody today and they were telling me how much the call yesterday impacted them. I thought about it, and I said, “Maybe it impacted other people as well.” They were saying that they could feel me inside them and I could feel them inside me.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Some of you are not only feeling me or Terry inside you; as soon as you love somebody they’re inside you; they’re not separated from you. We started a project called Team Shift, where people will come together every day in a small group and call in the Light on a conference call. It’s been kind of a back-burner project; there is probably sixty or seventy people doing it. When I gave my talk yesterday, Michael in San Diego was at the talk. I asked him, “What impacted you most in the work we’re doing?” He’s been coming for probably a few years now, and he said Team Shift, because he’s developed a group of people that connect every day.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I looked at it and I said that I think Carla and I have been developing that experience of living inside each other. You know, when I say that, I have to reinforce the idea this is total free will; I’m not co-dependent and I don’t need Carla; she’s not co-dependent and she doesn’t need me. We talked about it today and I talked about that experience with her. I was talking about it in relationship to the Christ, the Christed energies. I said, “I think this is related in some way.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Carla has a particular, I don’t know if I’d say religious, connection with Jesus; it’s different than mine. I had read the New Testament when I was younger and I kept asking myself, “I understand a lot of the words that Jesus is saying”; I understand them in a way that I knew they were true in my own life. I could validate them, but I was brought up Jewish and it was never like in my experience to say things like, “Jesus is my personal savior” or things like that. But I knew what he was saying; I knew the experience. I was having some of those experiences in my life at the time. I was feeling like, “This must be what Jesus was going through”.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You have to look from my point of view. Jesus was a human; he was very much human. As a human, he would make mistakes. In fact, in the Ra Material, I think it was in the Ra Material, Q’uo or Ra, it was indicated that when Jesus was a young man he got so angry at someone that his anger caused the person to die. He had to do a lot of amends in thinking about that and what that meant. When we look at Jesus as being perfect, he certainly was not, at least as I get it, but he did something amazing in his life.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">One of the things about having somebody live inside you is the fact that you get to feel not only their beautiful, loving nature you get to feel all of the human side of them; the things that are not perfect. On some level, if you find yourself having your expectations too high, then you kind of reject them, because you find what’s wrong with them. There’s something wrong with everybody; it’s okay to have something wrong with you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I was talking to Carla today. We were talking about Jesus, there was that Biblical experience, where they were going to stone this woman who was a prostitute; I think that’s right. Jesus said, “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone”. He was saying, “Who are you to judge her and where is your perfection?’</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So, we all have—I don’t use the word ‘sin’, but we have distortions, a human nature, a selfish side, a lustful side. It’s different for everybody, a jealous side and an acquisitive side. We all have that to some extent or another. Now, you’re going to let somebody in you, in this Christed space and maybe you’re going to feel some of their aspects. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Maybe you’ll reject that experience, because you find everything wrong with them. In my opinion, it’s that you can notice that and still hold to the beauty of the connection. To me, this is how the spiritual work downloads in a human way, that we can experience that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">When you have that experience of sharing space with another human in such an intimate way, because it is intimate, even though you’re not even seeing each other; it’s still intimate and very, very deep and close. It starts you on a state of healing yourself and forgiving yourself and accepting yourself, because if someone else accepts you, you start to accept yourself. I don’t think it ever means that you’re totally perfect and I don’t think that works in a human level. Because we’re human we all have survival issues; we have all kinds of things we’re working with. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You can make yourself unworthy of being loved because of all those issues. Particularly if you’re on a spiritual path, you start looking at yourself and you say “I’m not worthy of this; I’m not that worthy of the Elohim or Ra to pay attention to me. I’m not worthy of being loved.” Yet I know that’s not true.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">In fact, you have to start where you are and accept yourself to move through it. Even when you move through it, even when those aspects are not predominating, they’re probably still there on some lower level of programming. It becomes not letting them control you. You can notice them, but you don’t have to take action on them. It’s okay that they come up; if you suddenly feel jealous, you don’t have to say, “I’m bad; I’m feeling jealous.” You just have to say, “Here’s my lower nature bringing up jealousy. I’m not going act on it; I’ll go through the feeling. It’s not real; I’m not competing with anybody. I hope they do well.” Keep working on it that way; you may have to do that for the rest of your life. They may always come up. I used jealousy; you can use anything.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I thought I’d have Carla just share whatever she’d like to share in response to that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I’ll take a couple steps back; one to the left and bob twice.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Going back to what he was saying about it coming from a spiritual place, I think that reality is that we all are one. We really are all together; it’s a matter of becoming aware of it and feeling comfortable about it. I think the way it started with me anyway, it was a long, long time ago when I was a kid and I could feel that there was like an ever-living fountain inside of me that never stopped bubbling up. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Sometimes it would bubble up joy and sometimes I wouldn’t be in joy I would be in another feeling. I would be in pearly feelings on a rainy day; I’d be feeling contemplative and thoughtful. Or, it would be exciting feelings. “Oh, boy here comes March; March Madness; The University of Louisville, Number One, yay, yay!” You know; that’s bubbling up.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">But what’s mostly bubbling up is a basic state of alrightness and that basic joy I guess you’d call it; just simple joy. It’s just so good to be alive; it’s so good to be, smelling the roses. It’s so good to be here; it’s so good to be serving the Creator in whatever way we can and then just feeling that bubbling up. It’s not coming from me; it’s coming through me. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I’m participating in it; I’m partaking of it. I’m feeling it as it comes through. So I’m part of the fountain and so that part of the fountain that is me is colored in a certain way. It’s not just the day that’s coloring it, whether it’s sunny or whether it’s rainy; but it’s maybe whether I’m sunny or whether I’m rainy inside or whatever.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It’s not an effort and it’s not anything that is within my control, except that I can ignore it and I can live in a shallow way and decide, “Oh, I don’t really want to be aware of the archetypal minds today; I think I’m going to be totally shallow and I’m going to go shop for shoes.” But you can’t help it, because you’re shopping for shoes and you’re feeling the joy of shopping for shoes. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You can’t get away from the fact that there is what you could call your Christed self, your consciousness, that is the essence of you. Whatever else you are, if you get deep enough, if you get quiet enough, if you focus into yourself enough, you come upon this fountain that is constantly giving you Infinity. It’s flowing through you and out into the world and through you and out into the world.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Where is it coming from? It’s coming from The Infinite Creator; it’s bouncing from the Creator to the Sun and from the Sun to the heart of the Earth, from the Earth to the soles of our feet and up through our bodies and through our spines up through our spines and our electrical bodies that follow along the spines, all the chakras get a little poke you know. Up through the heart and up through the speech and the truthfulness and then up into spiritual work, all those energies up in the head and then out through the top of the head like a flame and out, back into the creation. It’s constantly doing that; it’s almost like the fountain then cycles back down and comes back through and it’s almost like, “Well, maybe it’s a circle instead of a fountain.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I don’t know what the right model of it is, but there’s that before you ever associate with another person. When you are able to associate with another person—maybe with--like Wynn, we have this suspicion that we’ve worked together before in other lifetimes; it’s always been really easy for us to sort of vibe in together. Whatever one person is talking about, the other person goes, “Oh yeah, I know what’s you’re saying.” It’s easy to understand and there’s no effort. That’s always nice.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I have the same thing with my husband. We notice it time and again; he can be gone for—I guess he was gone for all of three hours today and he came back and he said, “I’m so glad to see you! I feel like I’ve been gone an age. It’s really good to touch in with you.” There’s that joy; there’s that joy. You don’t have to be together; it’s not necessary to be together. There’s not a co-dependence there; there’s not neediness. Nobody’s pulling at anybody and yet there it is. What a joy it is to feel that. Really, never lose it; I never lose that feeling once I’ve gotten to that point with somebody; I never really lose it. It’s not something that I actually have thought a lot about, except there was this one time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We have a spiritual community here and we had a gal that was living in the house and volunteering, doing her very best to serve the Creator along with us and really loved The Law of One and wanted to help us out. She was helping us out a lot. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">She and I went together on a trip to Britain. I had to go over there because I had to be in somebody’s wedding. She was a Sufi and a Baha’i and in the Baha’i faith there is something where you stand for somebody, like an advisor. The bride has one and the groom has one. I was the groom’s advisor. I thought to myself, “I do not want to collect all the capital necessary to pay for a ticket over there and back and not do anything but go to a wedding.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So, I put it up on my site, L & L Research’s site, and said, “If you have a public place that we can meet I will be glad to teach for donations only. Let me know and we’ll get it together. I got together five different teaching locations all throughout Britain, north, south, east, west and London and it was fun. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">She just was incredible; I can’t carry anything. She was pushing me, schlepping bags. I don’t know how in the world she did all she did, but by golly, we got everywhere we needed to go. I did all the teaching I needed to do. She was so incredible; I was having a very intense time of it. It was at that point where I was starting not to be able to walk, so there was less and less mobility and more and more pain and a lot of difficulties.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So she and I were together a lot; we were playing Robbie Robertson’s Songs for American Indian People, something like that, and focusing on the American Indian ways. We started being able to dream the same dream and be in each other’s dreams and things like that, which is part of this experience sometimes. I’ve done the same thing with Wynn and certainly with my husband.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">When she got back she couldn’t shake that closeness that we had achieved, because once you achieve it there you are. You’re joined and you don’t do anything with it but it’s there. Finally she said she just couldn’t take it anymore; she needed to leave the community because—this is a quote, I don’t know how true it is—she said I lived in a very high degree of truth. She felt as though she was in the desert without a hat and she just was getting burned. She couldn’t really take it anymore; so off she went. I still feel that with her but of course I don’t do anything about it. It’s not something that she wants to do anything with.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">At any rate, there are drawbacks to it if you are of the suspicion that everybody’s got an agenda. I think that’s the one drawback; that when you experience this you need to let go of the concern that people might take advantage of you. If you start feeling that they’re too needy, that they’re trying to put you on a pedestal, that they’re judging you, any of those things, then you need to make a boundary and you need to make a distance between yourself and the other person, which can be done. It’s fairly easily done, as long as you really, really mean it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">That’s what you need to let go of in order to enjoy and participate in this being inside of each other, being one with each other at the very deepest and most intimate of spiritual levels. There is so much good that can be done by the doubling; you know, one and one is two, and two and two is four, but then the third person makes eight and the fourth person makes sixteen. Every time another person comes in it doubles the amount of energy that the group has. You very quickly get to a very high degree of energy and are able to serve and affect the Light and make the planet have more Light; offer more Light to the planet by making a place where that fountain can bubble through into the world.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We’re the only people that can do that because we’re humans. All the wonderful animals in the world, they do wonderful things; they don’t know how to do this. Only we humans can do that and people that aren’t in the body, that aren’t in incarnation here, they can’t do that either. They can serve; they can be there for us. But we are the ones that make the space on this side of the veil. So we can make a difference.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We do make a difference all the time, even if there’s nobody that we’re with, because we can get this fountain effect going simply by claiming our relationship with the Greater Self, the Creator and feeling that oneness on a very deep level. My goodness, what a blessing it is and what a pleasure it is to have friends of that intimate nature, where you can rest in each other and you give rest to each other. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Go ahead, Wynn.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think that as we speak of the idea of this it’s very important for a person that would like to have this kind of experience. Here is like a fine line: if you let yourself get close to somebody in this way and it’s of the highest, you’re going to be aware of them at a very deep level. And they’re going to be aware of you. If you’re ashamed of the parts of yourself, or any parts of yourself, then you may block this experience because you don’t want anyone to see that because you’re ashamed of it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You have an attachment to how you’re being seen and you want to put yourself out in a way that people can’t see those parts of you. To have this experience, you have to let go of that and you have to be willing to be seen. At the same time, you have to realize that other person can’t save you from yourself, but they can inwardly support you so that it speeds up the process of saving yourself or getting above all that stuff.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">One of the things about getting close to somebody is oftentimes when people are going through a lot of struggles and a lot of hardships, they become co-dependent. They want your energy on the outer level instead of the inner level. When you try to do it on the outer level, like talk to somebody, give them compassion, be their friend, they start wanting that all the time. It is not anywhere near the same thing as living inside someone. It’s a trick to be able to pull it off. I think that by coming together constantly on these calls and developing that reservoir of energy, it is creating a reference-point that all of you can work with.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If anyone wants to join Team Shift as an experiment and see if you have to apply this in Team Shift, because you’re going to be meeting people on the outer level, but the goal is not to have the outer level be it; it’s supposed to be the key to open up the inner levels so people share that aspect of themselves that is one with the Creator; the oneness of everything. You start developing inner support instead of outer support. The outer support becomes secondary to the inner support.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It’s a developmental thing and it can happen in the blink of an eye or it might take months. I decided to do this call and talk about this, because it creates a vision, a model of how it feels. I know that some of you will think that there’s something special about me or Carla. Of course there is something special, but there’s something special about everyone and in everyone’s unique way they have the ability to do this.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I have talents; I’m a good speaker. So you’re probably not going to be as good a speaker as I and Carla’s a good speaker and I have people around me that are bringing through messages. And Carla brings through messages, but we are still human. We have the full spectrum of the humanness. To feel the humanness in us allows you to feel the humanness in yourself and to accept yourself and to get over the shame of the parts of you that are not perfect. People think they’re going to go away, like *boom*; it’s not my experience that it works that way. All my imperfect parts are still there.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">In fact last week I got in trouble because I was on a call with the transcribers and I was eating potato chips. A couple of people got really mad at me, because I was being disrespectful. I apologize if you happened to be on that call and you heard the potato chips crunching. I was also tired because my energy was being set up to go to L.A. to go to these workshops. I didn’t want to be on the call, but I wanted to be on the call because that’s a really important project we’re doing. So maybe eating potato chips was giving people a chance to see if they would judge…</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The thing about it is, the mistakes you make are what everyone remembers you by, at least right afterwards. It’s not necessarily the track record of all the good things you’re doing. They see one mistake and they say, “Wynn is really like that” or “Carla is really like that”. No matter how many calls I’ve done or how much dedication I’ve shown, eating potato chips was my sin of the day and probably not being totally present in the way people wanted me to be present.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">But, these are very exercises that give us the opportunity to see through the lower aspects of ourselves, see through them and forgive somebody and re-integrate the rest. As long as you’re seeing the person’s faults and looking at them and focusing on them, you will never have the experience of anyone live inside you in a free will, supportive, loving way in the way that can heal you and heal each other. We are part of each other’s healing if we let it take place.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I thought that I would let Terry and Daphne share their perspective on this particular topic if they’d like to do it. Terry?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Okay, I could say a few words.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I think for me the connection with the higher Sources and the Christ Consciousness and the All That Is, the Spirit, is like a friend and a stabilizer for me so that when in my past I’ve had a lot of instability, like when I was kid I got sent to a foster home and put up for adoption and all kinds of stuff happened so I felt like I was just really kind of in the way and I wasn’t allowed to have friends. I had a hard time with my development and knowing how to relate with people because I didn’t know what the outcome would be. So I kind of went into the higher realms and established more secure, I thought, relationships.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I’m still kind of experimenting with this-world relationships, where I’ll open myself up to somebody. I’ll feel really friendly and outgoing towards them and then all of a sudden they’re gone. They stop talking to me, or they drop off the line or something. I’m still experimenting with this-world relationships.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m calling it the Christed relationship. I think when you develop the Christed relationship with somebody, then there’s not the co-dependency of having their energy and pointing it toward you. You can feel their energy with you; you can be with somebody and create the energy there but it’s only reinforcing what was there already, already flowing along. When there’s no energy on the inner that’s flowing, every time you’re with that person you start from zero and try to create some kind of rapport.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Now, I notice that I used to go to love people really deeply, but they didn’t know how to love back on this level. I didn’t understand it at all; it’s like I could see them and I could see where they were being, this was when I was younger, where they were blocked, but they couldn’t see themselves. I remember getting into conflicts because when somebody is more contracted than you, you have to go to their level of contraction. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Suddenly, everyone is figuring out who is doing what. “Something’s wrong here; is that you or is it me?” From their point of view it looks like you and from your point of view it looks like them. Everyone is arguing about what’s going on; this is a working-out kind of relationship; it hasn’t moved into the Christed energy. All that stuff takes place and you just move above it and love them and support them inwardly.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Daphne, do you want to make any comments about all this?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Hi there. This is a very complex topic. My own experience is actually quite a bit different than what Wynn has talked about. He’s talking about what from my perspective seems like a more personalized relationship of the Christed consciousness with other people. I come more from a Vedantic, or the wisdom tradition of the East, even though I have a strong affiliation with Orthodox Christianity, the Greek Orthodox Church and also mystical Catholicism. I’m more of a meditator. So the personal aspect of the relationship has not been as much a part of my past.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The Christed consciousness doesn’t necessarily, in my experience, mean a personal relationship. Oftentimes, it can mean bearing witness and bearing the truth or the validity of a situation from a point of centeredness, which may or may not entail a personal relationship. I’m not sure if I can explain more than that; it’s not necessarily the warm-fuzzies. It can be that if that is an authentic expression it’s not necessarily something that the personality-self can understand. Oftentimes our personality-self is caught up in wanting to preserve aspects of the ego and aspects of the egoic control that have a very hard time surrendering to a deeper truth.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I know that sounds kind of heavy and maybe it is heavy, because there has always been, at least in my own past, an absolutely fierce kind of a spiritual warrior adherence to truth. It’s just what I’ve had to do; it’s been my life. My life didn’t have a lot of warm fuzzies in it. I didn’t have warm-fuzzy parents and it just hasn’t been my way. But I guess that’s what I would say about it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You know what? Everyone’s got their path and everyone has to figure out their own path in their own way. I’m just trying to make some understanding because we’re in the middle of having a group here. What I’ve learned is that even though I can be very reclusive and be very happy being reclusive, I’ve found myself in the middle of this experience, which actually Daphne provoked to a great extent. I said, “What does this mean?” I started to learn that there were some extraordinary things that were important to people. How do I do this? How do I make this important to people? Then you start feeling people and you start feeling, “What do I do next in terms of supporting the people who are paying attention to this work? How do I do that? How do I stay true to myself? How do I not get caught up in everything that everyone is going through? How do I not take responsibility for everyone?” I can’t. Sometimes people think…</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Well, it’s not about drama, though, it’s about resting in people and letting people rest in you. It’s more being.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Right; exactly, exactly, exactly. You know, when you put yourself out into the world and you do something like this, invariably there are people that think you’re magic; that knowing you is going to fix them which is not usually the case. If you allow that to occur you end up with people pulling on your energies all the time and becoming dependent on you. The key to this is to put it all out in such a way that people take it back it to themselves and learn how to draw on what’s inside them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">But you can add to that this group energy aspect which doesn’t actually take any effort on my part; it does not deplete me to be participating in a group energy creation. In fact, it feels like it makes me stronger. That’s my experience.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Carla? What do you say?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I guess what I said was pretty much it. It’s not about doing anything with people or having them do anything with you; it’s a presence that is restful. You rest in them; they rest in you. I think that as you’re relating through the love in each other and it’s a spiritual love, so that there’s nothing of the personal in it. I would guess that it would be at the level of the archetypes; the level so deep that it’s deep within the beginnings of our human-hood.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I think we feel it if we’re part of a congregation at all; if we come together to worship. If we really are in a worshipping congregation, as opposed to a kind of a country club that is pretending to worship or a ‘joy-song thing’ where you just get all jumped-up and excited and you’re not really resting in each other—if you’re really coming to worship and if there’s that feeling of being a family in Christ or a family,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t know how other people put that in other world religions; I just have my own Christianity and so I’m kind of narrow there, but with that model I’ve often felt that wonderful feeling of that beautiful knowledge of people way deep down below how old they are, what they do for a living, what their circumstances are, if they have children, if they’re alone in life, anything like that. It’s so comforting.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I really miss her; there was a gal that every Christmas eve I used to just send her the world ‘Jesus’ and she’d send me the word ‘Jesus’ and we’d know. That’s all we needed. Of course, there was Don Elkins that I shared sixteen years of silence with; he never said anything about how he felt about me or anybody. He never talked; a very silent man and yet I had no question as to how he felt. It was so comforting to rest in him; he was like home to me.</span></p>

Definitely; it doesn’t go away. It’s so peaceful and it’s so abiding and I appreciate it so much.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I appreciate all of you. I think that on these calls we really do enter into each other and love each other. It isn’t that slurpy, “Isn’t it wonderful?” kind of love; it’s a love that doesn’t need any expression. It just is. So that’s where I would put it; I would put it way down below, before you ever get to things like language and relationships and stuff.</span></p>
