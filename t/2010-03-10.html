<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Disclaimer from Wynn: As I recommend with all channelings, take what resonates, leave behind what doesn't, and consider the rest. It is always possible for thoughts in the channels mind to bleed through and it's also possible for a source of mixed polarity to masquerade as something other. It's important to always apply your own discernment.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Questions and&nbsp;<span>Answers</span>&nbsp;with Ra'An, Wednesday March 10, 2010</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="background-color: transparent; border-bottom-style: none;">Wynn</span>: This is March 10<sup>th</sup>, 2010 and it's Wednesday. On this call we receive questions from people who are on our list normally. Terry and I go into a channeling session where we ask those questions to our Source and we get answers.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">(Wynn calls in the light)</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Do we have a source present?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes. This is Ra'An. This is March 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2010, focused in the area of Los Angeles, California, through channel&nbsp;<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc;">Terry Brown</span>&nbsp;and also making connection with each and every one on this line. We thank you all for tuning in and for being here. We love our connection with each and every one of you. You have questions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Yes we do. Our first question this evening is from a person who was watching a TV show of an evangelist who was selling holy water in a jar that would anoint you for 12 months and were asking people to call an 800 number to call in and purchase this and the person writing this said the lines were jam packed with callers. They were taking in a lot of money. He is saying that his spirit was telling him that the evangelists were deceiving people and he wants to know about your opinion of people who take money from people through television?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Thank you for the question.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Individuals are at their very heart accepting and they wish to make contact with the loving energy that can be available through sources such as Jesus. There have been many visits to wards wherein there have been healings from the water that one comes in contact with. Looking at water as a whole there are some waters that are very good for one and other waters that are not good for one. Concerning individuals who sell such items, would they be selling the water in containers that are unpolluted, this would be a treasure. However if they sold water that was merely from a well or from a river, there would be many pollutants and the individuals would not achieve the results that they hoped for. We, as we speak, are blessing the waters of earth. Concerning the individuals who would sell unclean waters or non workable waters that erroneously are said to heal, such individuals will eventually get their comeuppance. We do not wish to drag anyone's name through the mud. We speak in general terms that an individual who is taking advantage of such an offer, they will not receive the benefits as also water that is shipped in an unclean container may pick up pollutants. We suggest each individual make his own decision whether this is upright and honest or whether it is merely a scam and rely on their own intuitions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: In a situation like this I would like to add this question. If a person is making a purchase like this and their own heart has a very high intent in this purchase, that even if the person selling the water has not a pure intent, the person receiving the water might have a pure intent, and in their pure intent, they may bless the water just as Emoto the Japanese fellow, would say if you project love into a bottle of water it has a healing properties. Might not the potential for positive outcome be possible based on the person who was purchasing the water regardless of the person who was selling the water?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes, and this was one of our thoughts as we spoke and as we review the situation we see an intense amount of love going into the project on the people who are purchasing the water and they can make some of the water, depending upon their intent, be changed in structure and become healing.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The next question. This one person sent me a bunch of questions and they are obviously a student of the Law of One through Carla Ruckert and I can't possibly ask all their questions. But I will pick two questions here which are of interest to the most people. One of them is just a curiosity question and it is, where have all the ships and planes lost in the&nbsp;<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc;">Bermuda Triangle</span>&nbsp;gone to?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: The majority of the ships and planes lost in the Bermuda Triangle have gotten their directions misaligned based upon some ancient Atlantis-like structures which are disassembling the magnetic field in the area which causes the instruments to read poorly so the individuals do not know which direction they are going. They in fact are headed in the wrong direction and run out of gas. There are pirates in the area that have taken some of the boats and taking advantage of the anomalies in the area to move into their cadre. There are other instances wherein the instruments and the ship dissolve, translate into another dimension, and dissolve back and have time lost with a flight. The majority however, have had their instruments disrupted by the water structure in the area and have gotten lost.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Obviously there is some kind of vortex in that area. I won't say obviously but I would guess. Can you share where this vortex came from and why it exists?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: We can share some of it with you. The Atlanteans had structures in the area with crystalline director that aligned energy which were used by spaceships in their travels at the time. These are still somewhat operational and disrupt the area. They may be discovered at some time or another. Then there is current underwater base in the area which is currently used by starships. That is all we wish to say at this time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Is it possible to take the entire universe and turn it into a mathematical equation?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: There are nesting sequences within the entire universe wherein nesting equations are within nesting equations, within nesting equations. There are certain aspects of the universe which can be quantized into mathematical equations. We would say that the larger equation encompasses all, however it must be tagged to the inner nesting equations that riding, manifesting in the experiences, causing the experience of all.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now we are coming back to some human questions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Next question.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I understand that positive attitude is very important in order to attract the results that one needs. I have been trying to focus on a positive attitude but it has been very hard since I am going through a rough time.(that's my words) since she is trying to find a job, sell her house and have her life under control. I see that the time is ticking for me and it's very hard to focus on a positive attitude some days. What can I do to focus on a positive attitude which will contribute to attract the results needed for my current life situation? Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Thank you for your question. You are looking at all of these situations attempting to bring them under control and we suggest that those situations are one within the other. They are different from one another. To bring your life under control would be to bring each of the situations you are encountering under control, and we suggest you start with something very small for instance organizing your room, organizing glassware, organizing paperwork and just starting with something small and giving yourself a lot of credit for getting that organized and keeping that one thing organized then branch into something else to organize that, which would be perhaps talking with the realtor. Getting all your housing documents into one container in the same area where you know exactly where it is. This organization will bring control little by little in increments to your life through more and more of your life.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Is the idea that as you get more things more under control in a small way, you start changing your energies and you feel a sense of accomplishment and the change in accomplishment starts to change the energies of the bigger, more difficult challenges?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: This one is attempting to bring everything under control at once then one thing might be out of control and then lead to discomfort in other areas. If a person would take one small area and get it under control and then another area under control then eventually this will spread and the individual then can rely on something which is under control, even if it is small, and gradually rely on more and more which is under control.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Next question. When I go out among people just running my errands, shopping, the bank, the post office and I interact with people I come home feeling sleepy. I spent the next day with what seems to be pulling myself together and regenerating for lack of a better word. Can you tell me why this happens and what I can do to keep this from happening? Are people taking my energy and is that good for them and should I let them if it helps them?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: If you can move into your own center instead of fragmenting into their energy, you will keep your own center and your own energy together. We suggest that you put your own centering first and your own accomplishments as this is what will guide you, rather than move into other people's guidance systems, which can tire one out. There is no right way to do something so if you let others take your energies this is an area which you are experiencing, can then it can give you knowledge. As far as whether it is good for another to take your energy, it may not be or it may be. It depends upon the individual situation.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In my own personal experience and I think the channeling entity also, when we first started doing these calls and when I first started doing public talks I experienced a huge level of exhaustion afterward which I had to recover from, which I am not experiencing to the extent I did a couple of years ago. Is there a connection with the chakras in this aspect, for example. If a person had their upper chakras open and their lower chakras more closed, would that tend to make them more vulnerable to the&nbsp;<span>psychic energy fields</span>&nbsp;and have a hard time releasing them because of the more closed nature of their lower chakras?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: As an individual has chakras. Those on the call may not be familiar with what the chakras are. They are spinning energy centers within the body which perform a function as the individual moves through. They connect to the outside world and interface to bring energy to the individual. We were talking about why one would get tired but there is a larger question on the table. Would you repeat that?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: The question had to do with the seven chakras. The upper chakras are connected with psychic sensitivities, sensitivity to vibrations, and the lower chakras have to do with grounding and connecting into the earth and the question was, if everyone has different chakras activated, we all have our unique balance of chakras, so if someone was having that kind of sensitivity that they would be getting tired when they were around other people and ostensibly because they are picking up the energies of other people and processing them, would that be an indication that the lower chakras are not as strong as they could be?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: It may be an indication of that or it may be an indication the the individual is over using one of the chakras not balancing it with the other chakras. If one is working with the higher chakras and the higher frequencies to the exclusion of the lower chakras they may exercise the upper chakras more and then may be higher. If they balance it then each chakra will do more of the work and if some of the chakras are not working properly, it places stress on the other chakras which are overworking.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Next question. I am wondering if illness in the body is always precipitated or caused by a spiritual imbalance?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: As always there is a spiritual imbalance behind disease. Take examples of some multiple personality cases where one personality may be in charge of the body and the individual has&nbsp;<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc;">diabetes</span>&nbsp;and then another individual then moves into being in charge of the body and the person no longer has diabetes but it is the same body functioning and it is precipitated by the orientation of the individual and the past of the individual and the karma of the individual as to how he or she confronts that which is to be confronted as one moves through his or her life path. They may put different diseases in the road as they move on. This may also be because different individuals who have different energy systems or chakras open and functioning, some of which are functioning correctly and some incorrectly which can block flow which then can create stuckness within a part of the body and create disease emanating out of that area of the body. For instance, the&nbsp;<span>gall bladder</span>, would there be a blockage in this area it could affect digestion that could upset decisions and it could block the energy and then precipitate certain cancers, for instance colon cancer. The energy is like a fine tuned clock when working properly, although a clock is much more simple than the actual situation. When all of the energies are working properly together give the body a really fine tune and disease free life.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now this person has an added question in the same topic and it has to do with if a person is taking a bad prescription drug which has unknown side effects a year later, how does this relate to the answer that you just gave?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: If a person is taking a bad medication it can create toxicity particularly in the liver area and begin to shut down the liver which may back up through the body and not be eliminated properly and cause allergies and discomfort. That is one particular likely way that one may be affected by taking a bad medicine. Worse can happen.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Is that particular circumstance then even if a person is spiritually balanced, a bad medication can throw them into disease?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: That is correct.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: There are probably other circumstances like this. For example, if a person is exposed to a lot of smog or something in a toxic environment. Now maybe if they have a very high spiritual connection they can overcome some of these negative influences and maybe not. Can you comment on that?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Some areas where there has been a high degree of chromium in the water and that the imbalance of chromium in the system can make a person deathly ill. One may not know they are drinking chromium in the water and this can also lead a person to an early death. High fluoride can lead a person to have mottling of the teeth. As a person is grounded within the 3D in the body, particularly is grounded within the 3D, and as the body interfaces with the environment can cause difficulties with any individual, practically every individual.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />Wynn: Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">That is our last question for this evening. Do you have any closing comments?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: We note that there has been rain in the area of&nbsp;<span>Southern California</span>and this will begin to supply much needed water in this area. Also in the area of Georgia there has been more rain and droughts are ending in those areas and it is something that your group has asked for. We thank each and every one of you on the line and those who listens later. We are available to you if you should wish to draw on us. Adonai.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: We thank all of you for being on this line.</span></p>

<p>Have you checked out <a href="http://conversationswithmygirlfriend.com/" target="_blank">Conversations with My Girlfriend?</a> This was the website I put up in 2003 when I was in the midst of writing his book <a href="http://returnofedgar.com/" target="_blank">The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce?</a> When I put up this website, I left myself anonymous and both Daphne and Terry anonymous. I was a bit wary of putting this into the world and how people would react. I called them Girlfriend X and Girlfriend Y. Daphne didn't like being Girlfriend X. She thought it sounded X rated. If I had to do the website today, it would be far more politically correct to say "personal relationship", but I leave it as it is because at some point I would suspect naysayers and skeptics might be evaluating this and this archive site stands as a monument to what had occurred for me in the previous year from 2002-2002.</p>
