<p>Thanks to Suzanne Hayes for transcribing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transcription<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ra'An for August 31st, 2011<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> This is August 31st, the last day of August. Wynn in<br />Scottsdale, Arizona near Phoenix and Terry in Sedona and<br />tonight we have our question and answer call, where we address<br />questions that you have submitted to us. We have some really<br />interesting questions tonight. You never know what is going to<br />happen on these calls. It's always kind of an adventure, because<br />one thing leads to another, and oftentimes information comes<br />through that has never really been shared, to my knowledge<br />about the workings of the universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it's not so important to intellectually understand those things, <br />but many of the people who are attracted to this work are old <br />souls who have been around.&nbsp; <br /><br />According to the information that we get, most of us have had <br />thousands of lifetimes, on not only earth, but on other planets, <br />and other star systems. <br /><br />And there's a predisposition to keep repeating the same patterns.&nbsp; <br />It's like you think you've learned, but you know what, it's not so <br />much learning, it's, well&nbsp; I have come to the conclusion that it's <br />finding something like we're doing, that you can suddenly resonate <br />with the big picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because if it was just a matter of soul advancement, if you were <br />one of those beings who graduated this realm, and there are <br />millions and maybe billions who have, and you are part of the <br />Ra Group, and you choose to come back and take an reincarnation, <br />then chances are that you will get caught back up in this realm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Carla Ruckert, 90% of Ra Wanderers who come into <br />this realm get caught back up in it.</p>
<p>That is a profound bit of information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I thought about this for some time, my first thought was why <br />don't people hold their graduation when they come back, why do <br />they get caught back up in it?&nbsp; <br /><br />And the answer I came up with is that the circumstances that <br />cause someone to graduate, has to do with what happens to them <br />in their life and what they run across.&nbsp; And the program that we are <br />running here is the kind of program&nbsp; that gives people the <br />understanding that can allow them to graduate.<br /><br />Because in order to graduate, you need to be detached from the<br />energies of the physical realm. That does not mean that you can't<br />participate in them. It does not mean you cannot feel them. It doesn't <br />mean you cannot totally love somebody or that you can't have great sex. <br /><br />The key word is detachment. That you go through each experience and <br />then let go of it, and go back to neutral, instead of hooking into <br />the experience and getting addicted to it which starts up the cycles of <br />reincarnation.&nbsp; And particularly, if you can connect to the energies of <br />these group souls which are outside of this realm, you now have a <br />reference point of an energy you can be attached to, that is not in the <br />3D realm. So, it enables you to graduate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, I came into this realm and I had a very difficult upbringing, <br />and I was screwed up for many, many, years of my life, even though I<br /> have done very far out things in past lifetimes.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I didn't have the most incredible synchronicities and circumstances <br />happening to me and also the releasing of a lot of pain.&nbsp; It's like, even if I <br />did something far out thousands of years ago, I should have it all together,<br />it's not true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you come back in each lifetime, it's like, in a certain sense, <br />with a clear slate and you carry all the energetics of all your past lifetimes.&nbsp; <br /><br />But then you have the opportunity to create it. &nbsp; <br /><br />And you pick parents, particularly if you're an old soul the chances are <br />you picked your parents.&nbsp; And you might ask, why did I pick parents that <br />I was going to have such a hard time with?&nbsp; Well, one of the reasons, <br />if you're one of those people, is because when you have a difficult <br />situation in this realm, it almost&nbsp; forces you to find the truth, because you <br />can't find it in the situation.</p>
<p>When people come into this realm and havea really easy time of it, say <br />because they have wealthy parents.&nbsp; They don't have to worry about <br />money so very often they have a very comfortable life, but they don't grow.&nbsp; <br />They just have a comfortable life.<br /><br />It's only when you're backed up against the wall, that you are forced to reach<br />and stretch for truth.&nbsp; Someone once said that "nobody goes through a dark <br />night of the soul unless they have no other choices".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because once you start going through a dark night of the soul, you're going <br />to surface all your negative patterns and they are going to come up.&nbsp; <br />Sometimes when people come on these calls they start to provoke a dark <br />night of the soul, and they have to go through that. It's not that I provoke <br />it, it's the nature of the energy on the call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or alternatively, and this is why people get in trouble when they <br />see this kind of stuff,&nbsp; they think, God, he must be negative because when<br />I'm around him I thought everything was supposed to be all beautiful and loving, <br />and it triggers all this suffering.&nbsp; Now it doesn't happen with everybody, but <br />with certain people it does.&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, Daphne is one of those people and it's more complicated, its not <br />simple, but when this stuff started coming up, it brought up a huge amount <br />of suffering for her, and even myself when we're going through that, she <br />asked; " if this is so positive, why am I suffering so much", and I had to <br />reevaluate it myself.&nbsp; I wondered why was that so?</p>
<p>And so, I had to understand how stuff gets surfaced in the matrix to be <br />released.&nbsp; If you truly go through it, you're done with it, you don't have <br />to go through it anymore. But part of the process of going through it <br />entails a certain amount of suffering, a certain amount of pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you're one of those people that's going through that, the fastest way <br />to go through it is, to accept it. Just say ok, I'm releasing stuff, and keep <br />surrounding it with the love and light, but don't run away from it.&nbsp; Let <br />yourself go through it.&nbsp; It may take a month or a year, or two years, but <br />stay with it because once you're done with it, you're done with it, and <br />you're free of all those things, and you live in a different state of <br />consciousness.<br /><br />So on that note, let us call in the light and let me get to our questions <br />for today.<br /><br /><br />(Wynn calls in the light)<br /><br /><br />We wait for our Sources who are pure energy in different<br />dimensions, not one single energy. These are group souls<br />forming the answers and bringing them through Terry, and<br />because they are in another dimension, in another time line,<br />they can operate in a way of bringing through great <br />complexities and making them very simple through all the <br />translation processes.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Do we have our Sources present?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We greet you in the love-light of the One Infinite Creator.<br />This is August 31st, 2011, planet earth with Terry Brown in<br />Sedona,&nbsp; Arizona and this is Ra'An. We bring you greetings and<br />love and we make contact with those who wish to make contact<br />with us. You may not necessarily feel our energies as we have<br />a very high delicate frequency and we are available to respond<br />to your questions. Do you have questions?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Yes we do. Thank you for coming forth for us. This is a<br />message from Colleen. She asks, in this time of numerous<br />emerging channels who claim to be conduits for Jesus, what<br />guidelines are suitable for determining their authenticity?&nbsp; (And<br />I can make this an overview question. Even channels that are<br />coming through and identifying with any kind of higher being,<br />whether it be Archangel Michael or any of the multitude that<br />are coming forth. How can we test it and what is the criteria?)<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />There are a multiplicity of beings in the larger world and<br />these entities can intercept channeling minds and bring<br />through their own slant on things. The mind of the channel<br />can also interject different prejudices or thoughts or<br />leanings that the channel themselves have. <br /><br />When you make contact through a channeled source, as <br />every entity has their own energy signature frequency, <br />this is a frequency that can be recognized. Each of you <br />on the call has your own signature frequency and we can <br />interconnect with your frequency. It becomes like a calling <br />card. It becomes like a familiar face.<br /><br />One can learn to connect with the frequency and recognize the<br />signature frequency to tell that you are being addressed by an<br />entity and the entity is the one it says it is. <br /><br />A second way to tell if the energy coming through is of a help, or<br />assistance, is to see whether it resonates with you own<br />understanding, your own knowledge, whether it expands and<br />makes larger your own body of feeling of connection and body<br />of information.</p>
<p>A third way to tell is that there can be the element of the <br />Christ Consciousness in the channeling when it is a higher source. <br />This source, whatever source you are dealing with, when you<br />are dealing with channeling and be challenged to see if they <br />come in the Christ Conscious energy.<br /><br />Those are three ways you can tell.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> A subset question is, does the entity Jesus, sometimes<br />called Sananda, ever talk through people?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> There are individuals that are connected to a higher<br />body that represents themselves as Sananda. As we look at the<br />situation, there are a lot of channeled energies; a lot of<br />beings, that bring through channeled data from entities that<br />are connected with the movement towards Jesus.</p>
<p>One must be careful, as what we see is that generally there <br />is an interface between the stated being they are reportedly <br />channeling and the person receiving the information.&nbsp; And this <br />interface, the channel or the group of non embodied beings <br />that are claiming, and very passionately so, in many cases, <br />to be Jesus, may be a subset of beings who are working <br />very diligently and in their own view of saving individuals.</p>
<p>These individuals can be very passionate and very desirous <br />of connection and have very good intentions at heart, so <br />your question, does Jesus ever come through any of the <br />individuals?</p>
<p>Now when we look at this we see the Father, the Son and <br />the Holy Ghost and we see that the Christ Consciousness <br />comes through more often than the individual entity of Jesus, <br />although it is possible that Jesus also can come through, as <br />Jesus is working very diligently in the connection with individuals <br />and the effort to raise them up.</p>
<p>This is a complex question as we see groups, connected to <br />groups connected to Christ Consciousness, and so there is <br />often an interface between the Holy Ghost, the Christ Consciousness,<br />and the individual receiving the channeling. There are very few<br />who that are connected directly with the Christ Consciousness<br />and only a few that are connected directly with Jesus. That is<br />our answer.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />What I noticed about the Ra Group is that they bend over<br />backwards not to create a hierarchy and when a source comes<br />through someone and identifies themselves as a very notable <br />being in the past, or an Ascended Master there are two things <br />at play.</p>
<p>One is by making an identification like that, it may <br />cause someone to pay more attention than if they didn't.</p>
<p>On the other hand, by making that identification can cause <br />someone to give up their power to that higher being who is <br />communicating with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So are both of those things true?&nbsp; <br /><br />When someone consistently identifies themselves as at the top<br />of a hierarchy, can that lead to a negative source, perhaps, <br />by using that identification?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> This is a very good observation. When an individual<br />finds himself giving his power to a channeled source, or giving<br />his identity or his own mastery, then be very careful as this is <br />one of the signs of a negative source.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />This is from Edna. I was told by the Sources that I am a star<br />seed. (A star seed is a being from a higher dimension who comes<br />into this realm for service and forgets that was the case and<br />gets lost in this realm.)<br /><br />Edna asks, are star seeds supposed to do some specific job<br />here? I wonder if I am doing what I am supposed to be doing.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you. It is not a case of what you are supposed to<br />be doing, it is a case of your own goal; your own reason for<br />being here, the reason that you have set, your own self, not<br />an assignment.</p>
<p>Although there is often a briefing in the other realm before an <br />individual takes a body, wherein the individual is questioned <br />and reveals the reason why they want to come to the 3rd density <br />and in your case, you have some failed goals that you are holding <br />on to, that you wish to fulfill to do with working with individuals, <br />with groups to ease their path and make their life better.</p>
<p>In the case of Atlantis things went wrong to do not with <br />anything that you were doing but to do with the master plan <br />for the society at the time being interfered with by other forces.&nbsp; <br /><br />And this is one of the reasons why an individual can get a<br />failed goal in a certain lifetime, as the purpose was cut short <br />and the individual is still oriented in fulfilling that goal.</p>
<p>It is a separate time, a separate place and there are similar <br />circumstances in place in the earth plane at this time, and <br />so it triggers subconsciously this desire to find fulfillment, <br />this working with others.</p>
<p>You are working with others at this time on Team Shift, and each<br />little thing you do oriented towards helping individuals to<br />raise their own level.</p>
<p>So this lost goal from the past is pretty big, and you can <br />release it, as everything is in the Now, and Now is a separate <br />circumstance, wherein there are similarities but you can shift <br />and move it into this life's goals.&nbsp; We hope this helps.</p>
<p>Do you have other questions?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Yes. Let me just add. If one identifies with being a<br />Wanderer, as opposed to thinking of some grand, majestic thing<br />that you are supposed to do, never miss a single opportunity<br />to lift the situation, and it can be the most simple of things. <br /><br />It's the way you smile at people and greet them in the ordinary <br />ways, consistently, it keeps your energy up. And finding ways <br />to do that.&nbsp; Making a call to someone who would appreciate <br />a call from you.&nbsp; Somebody who is lonely or sick.</p>
<p>Sometimes we hear you're an inter-dimensional soul, and you <br />have come here and you can start thinking you're special.&nbsp; And <br />that can separate yourself&nbsp; from your real abilities to contribute, <br />because you want other people to recognize you.&nbsp; And the need <br />for recognition moves everything into a lower level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the actual doing of things that genuinely contribute to the lives <br />of other people, is one way of fulfilling the role of a Wanderer. <br /> Am I accurate when I say this?</p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Yes, ok, so don't miss an opportunity to lift the vibration<br />and suddenly as you do that, you consciously assume that<br />wherever you are, you are there to lift something.</p>
<p>And so find the ways to do it and you'll start living in a different <br />consciousness.&nbsp; Instead of being in a dilemma of what am I <br />supposed to do, you will be in the middle of doing it and then <br />more things will start flowing towards you that allows you to do more.</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>(The next question is about ascension.&nbsp; This is from someone <br />who has read the book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would preface this as I have asked many, many questions on this, <br />and when we hear the word ascension we immediately think there's <br />going to be this moment when we're all going to disappear from <br />this realm, including me, I thought that.&nbsp; And maybe that's still true, <br />I don't know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our general line of questioning on this topic,&nbsp; most people are not <br />going to leave this realm in that way.&nbsp; After they die and graduate, <br />in what I think they call an astral ascension, your heart needs be open <br />slightly more than half, to move into the higher octaves of the earth, <br />but in a physical ascension all your chakras have to be open a little <br />more than half from your root chakra to the crown chakra, and most <br />people won't qualify for that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when we ask questions and when people start thinking, I'm just<br />waiting for that moment when I disappear, I don't think it's going to <br />happen.&nbsp; So I'll still let our Sources address it.&nbsp; So to continue with <br />the question)</p>
<p>Is the ascension to 5D going to be a actual physical body change or <br />just mental or will we experience this in this lifetime? How do we <br />know that we can trust the portal of the shift to be from the creator <br />and not just some negative ET?&nbsp; And what about our loved ones <br />and our children? &nbsp; How can we make sure we all ascend together?<br />She says thank you, Terry and this is from Ami.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you Ami.&nbsp; We see that when an individual <br />ascends they generally do not take their body. They do take <br />their astral body, which moves through the tunnel of light, <br />which works with them and carries them, changes their <br />frequency so that they are able to move to the higher <br />dimensions with openness and for their remaining physicality <br />of matrix to change its vibrations so it can move to the higher <br />realm.</p>
<p>If an individual ascends and takes their whole body, <br />their whole body would need to transform to the higher <br />frequency and the majority of people are not able to make that <br />transition.</p>
<p>Many bodies are in some state of non-optimum functioning <br />and it is very often a feeling of relief or a feeling of blessing to <br />let the physical body go and take their new life with a new body <br />in the higher realms, which does not have the state of dysfunction <br />that their earthly body may have had. <br />We hope that answer helps.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />Given that a person when they leave this realm goes into a<br />tunnel of light, if a person knows that, while they are still<br />conscious in their body, will they remember that when they are<br />dying and trust that light tunnel, and can they be sure it is<br />not a negative portal they are going through?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> There are often angels that come in to guide one to the<br />portal of light as the angelic realm keeps track and observes<br />and is available for help. We are also available for help also<br />assistance to guide one.</p>
<p>When one is passing to the other side, their consciousness <br />moves out of the body, and they are still as aware as they <br />were in the body and hear the conversations of people, and <br />know what they are saying even if the body is unconscious.</p>
<p>When one moves into the tunnel of light, there is a feeling of <br />support and healing of caring and moving and shifting them <br />to the higher frequencies. If a lower source comes to them it <br />will be known.&nbsp; As an entity might come and attempt to bring <br />them into a lower realm situation. The individual him or herself <br />is the generator of their own matrix, and if they have negative<br /> leanings, then they may pull in a negative source that may <br />attempt to identify with that negativity within them and then <br />guide them into some negative situation.</p>
<p>As far as remembering when they pass over about the<br />tunnel of light, it is more of a soul matrix process of moving<br />over simply the astral and leaving their body and then<br />connecting with the opportunities available to them in<br />transition.</p>
<p>Since their intellect is still functioning, their knowledge, their <br />consciousness moves out of the body and they are still <br />conscious even though they are out of the body and if they <br />are remembering in the body, then they will probably<br />carry the seeds of remembering out of the body.</p>
<p>If they are are overcome by fear, and if they are not in a <br />loving state then they may not be able to connect with the <br />frequency of the tunnel of light and may not be able to <br />recognize the angels that come to help them.</p>
<p>They may may go off in a state of separateness to become <br />a ghost or to try to continue to live their life. Some people <br />do not realize that they have passed over when they die and <br />they still feel alive and so they walk around assuming that they <br />are alive and people can hear them, but they are quite upset <br />when people do not hear them. We hope that sheds some light on it.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you. That is a great answer.<br /><br />Dennis asked a question about the law of karma. He has heard<br />sources say that karma does not exist in the higher realms as<br />it does in the 3rd density. What is the implication of that<br />when choosing the negative path?</p>
<p>For a 3rd density entity, is it possible to act in Service to Self <br />and build up karma. What happens in a higher density when <br />possibly there is not karma anymore, which is his assumption <br />but an entity chooses Service to Self actions. What will happen <br />to that entity, will he disintegrate?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you for your question. If an entity has karma and<br />they move into the higher realm, it is very likely they will<br />take their karma with them, and although they will drop the<br />infirmities of the body to their great relief, they will still<br />be caught up in some disturbance within their soul matrix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then they insist on coming back to earth because it feels <br />that on earth is where they can complete this incompletion.</p>
<p>When an individual moves to the higher realm, we do not see <br />that they are devoid of karma, although it can be very much <br />easier for them in the higher realm, and we see that there are <br />laws that karma operates by.&nbsp; It is not laws laid down by <br />some unjust individual but laws that are woven into the <br />mechanics of how things work in the universe.</p>
<p>When an individual has enough growth that they can learn to <br />operate without triggering these laws, then they can be free <br />of karma and move from realm to realm with impunity.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />I would like to ask a question about what I was saying on the<br />beginning of the call.</p>
<p>When circumstances that create someone to graduate this <br />realm occur, because they run into a situation like what we <br />are doing here, which enables them to connect with energies <br />of higher densities and release their earthly attachments, <br />because the deduction was that if Ra souls keep coming <br />back and they get caught up again in reincarnation, then it's <br />not the advancement of the soul that assures it will graduate, <br />it is coming into contact with something in their life that will <br />re-stimulate that graduation, that possibility. Is that accurate <br />to any extent?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> That is greatly accurate. It is the coming into contact<br />with a situation that reminds one that they do have other life<br />besides their life here, and that this is simply a transition<br />within the earth plane and all is not lost when one dies.</p>
<p>If they take the growth that they have obtained in this lifetime<br />and in earlier lifetimes and they grow, and they can take that <br />with them.</p>
<p>When one dies they can take things with them and this is one <br />of the things they can take with them, this growth that they <br />have made; their opportunities and their giving and caring <br />and communicating with others and being touched by things <br />and reminded of things in the earth realm can help them when <br />they move into the higher realm.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />We are going to bring this session to a close. Do you have any<br />closing comments before we separate?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We see the individuals on this line. We see you<br />energetically and we send you love and kisses and we are<br />honored to be in contact with you.<br /><br />Adonai.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you all for being here and for supporting this.<br />This is very special that we gather like this and experience<br />this perspective from other realms. I hope you will check out<br />our grid healings at 10 am Pacific Daylight time. Thanks to<br />everyone.<br /><br />______________________________________________<br /><br /><br />Copyright 2002-2011 Wynn Free and Message a Day &nbsp;This<br />transcription may be freely shared, provided this copyright<br />notice and contact information is included and there is no<br />charge.
