<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Hey everybody, everybody listening on BBS and everybody on our phone line, this is Wynn Free in Sedona. Those of you that are checking in for the first time, you are in the middle of an experiment and it has to do with, are there voices talking to us that created the Universe? Can they make themselves known to you in a way that you can feel it? In a way that’s uplifting?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">They say they can and I get numerous emails from people who can feel energies on the line. While you’re on this line you may notice and I’ll tell you how it feels; at least, it’s different for everybody. I don’t want to say this is how it’s going to feel for you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">For many people it’s not like a stranger coming in. It’s an energy; you know how you walk into a room and there’s good vibes and you can feel the energy in the room and suddenly you shift? It’s kind of like that, except you’re on a conference line; you’re not walking into a room. There’s nothing in your physical proximity like another human, that’s bringing energy in.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When you walk into a room and there’s something going on, you’re around other humans who all have energy and when they have good energy, some of you can feel the energy; many of you can feel that. When they don’t have good energy you can say its bad vibes. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">What’s happening is; people keep coming back to these calls. Sometimes this really, really profound information comes in, but most of all there’s an energy that helps lift your spirits. The energy comes in, not because of anything I do and not because anything you do, except to be neutral; you don’t have to try. Just be relaxed; be in a quiet place and that doesn’t necessarily guarantee that you’re going to feel it, but many people do.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The people that feel it the fastest are those people who our Sources would identify as star seeds or Wanderers, that is, people who actually were in other dimensions, graduated this realm, came into this realm to be of service and, invariably, they got lost. 90% of them get lost; they go into the reality systems here.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Inside themselves, they have a tuning-fork that is very much connected to the higher realms and when they come into these calls, their tuning fork starts to vibrate because it’s got a resonance with the energy. Those are the people that get the most immediate reaction.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Everybody can get the reaction; it’s not limited to anybody. But if you’re having lots of trauma inside yourself, if you’re in pain, if you have un-worked-out karma, your circuits might be a little bit clouded, fogged, so it’s hard to feel the energy. We do talk about those things and we do look for keys to help clear those things. Many people, after they’re on the line for a couple of months or a couple of weeks, suddenly get it; they open up.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Consider it your personal experiment. I’m only a reporter here; I’m sitting in the middle of it. I’m telling you, if you’ve read my book, which I hope you have and by the way, reading the material helps open you up—read the materials; they say their energy is in their words. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Read the <i>Creator Gods</i> book which we give away for free; reading <i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce</i>, reading the Ra material from Carla Rueckert, <i>llresearch.org,</i> it all starts to help tune you in and you learn how to fit into this physical realm in a different way, a different perspective, instead of that part of you that’s saying, “What am I doing? Where’s the money? What am I going to do? What am I supposed to do? What’s my role?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Your first role, if you’re looking for a role, has to do with tuning. Tuning, getting your tuning fork vibrating in resonance with the frequencies of the higher realms. Then you automatically start being of service, because you’re lifting the vibration around you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We’ve got a lot of questions tonight. Some of you listened to the replay of the interview on Darkness Radio with David Schroder which was on Monday night. For the very first time ever, we did a channeling; Terry brought in our Sources live. I was on the show a week before and David talked to me for two hours. Some of you listening probably heard that. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We had a bit of a misunderstanding, because I asked him to run all the questions through me. The reason we do that is because my role in this is to hold the space, hold the energy. By doing that, it creates safety for the person who is channeling. The questions that are asked have to be carefully reviewed prior. Why is that?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It’s because certain kinds of questions can bring in negative sources. One of the things as I understand it: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>when you’re dealing with a group matrix energy, you’re not dealing with a single being that’s answering questions. We’re not dealing with an ascended being; even a high being in other realms that has wisdom. We’re dealing with group energies and they do have wisdom, but they’re a group matrix. Whatever I talk or ask about, the energy starts moving into that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If I ask a question that has a lot of negativity attached to it, the energy suddenly shifts. You can actually bring in a negative source. I think we’ve had that happen occasionally on the line.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When we did this show, David took it upon himself to ask the questions, which was not our prior agreed upon protocol. It was the last question which was unfortunate, because it was the one left hanging in people’s minds. Up to the last question, he did a really good job. I let him ask the questions, although it was not supposed to work that way. It’s much safer if I ask the questions, but in general his questions were okay.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The last question was a strange question, because he said “Can you tell us about Renard?” and he just left it like that. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>[The exact question was, “Do you know who is the being is that calls themselves Renard?”] If you’re listening to these calls you know that we don’t take inventory of other people, of other groups. People ask us, “Is this positive? Is this negative?” It’s not up to me to tell you; that’s part of your lesson in discernment, to figure it out. We do set a frequency here and if you learn to feel the frequency, you’ll be able to tell if somebody else is coming from a high frequency.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It’s a frequency that is not a show-off frequency; it’s not a self-aggrandizing frequency; it’s a frequency that can lift your spirits, make you feel loved inside yourself, if you open to it. When you’re looking in anything, you can learn to feel the frequency and decide if that’s there. It’s my feeling that if something makes you feel loved inside of yourself and if it makes people love each other and open to each other, then that’s a very good criteria for positive.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If something is just being an expert all the time, knows all the answers, you may learn something, but it may not be positive. Both the negative and the positive can channel through people. The negative is tricky; they can say they’re the Elohim, they can say they’re Jesus. How do you figure out if it really is or it really isn’t? You have to look for that loving frequency; you can’t just go by the words that are being said.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When he asked this question about who is Renard, I didn’t want to ask it. David insisted. I said “Okay, let’s let it go through”. We got a rather strange answer. They said “Renard is a composite of different things” and that was it. I thought that might be their way of side-stepping the question. Terry, I think, wants to clarify something about what she felt when that question was being asked.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">By the way, this has become a really big thing on his show and this evening somebody who put that question there was going to be on the show and talk about it. I called David up and I said “Okay, he’s going to talk about it; I want to talk about it”, because I didn’t know what they were going to say, if they were going to try to discredit us, or if somebody was trying to trick us and just made up something; I didn’t know, and I still don’t know. [Interestingly enough, this show was cancelled due to “technical difficulties” and they ran a replay of one of their archives.]</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In any case, Terry what did you want to say about that?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to say first of all, if someone listens to it and then senses [David’s] energy like when he was talking about the healing of the girl, his energy was really good. When it got to the last question, if you noticed his energy; his energy became adverse. The whole energy…</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>David’s energy, yes. His energy suddenly became adversarial on the last question. I noted that. The question, I don’t know that he knew what the answer was at the time, like in full. But, what came through, the first thing that came through, was of evil and good vying for supremacy. That would fit how the energy shifted on the call at that point.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The Elohim didn’t want to say that; they then looked at the audience and there are people by that name, Renard. It’s a French name with a silent ‘d’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There would be people listening or come to listen to the call at some point that had that name and the Elohim didn’t want what they were getting to be attached, in any way, to those people named Renard, because it really didn’t fit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><b><i><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: white;">&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">They had said at the start “Give us a moment.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>[The first level of looking during that silence was that they did not know of a being named Renard that the questioner was asking about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Looking deeper, the second level of looking was that there were both evil and good thoughts involved. Some of these thoughts were intellectual, some were emotional with an element of practicality and some thoughts were changing. Going deeper, the third level of looking was that there are actual people named Renard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The fourth level of looking was that there was a ‘being’ named Renard who had elements of both evil and good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They felt extremely uncomfortable using the word ‘being’ in relation to Renard] and this was what was going on during that moment of silence. They were trying to decide how to handle that question of the supremacy of good and evil. Then they commented about a ‘being’ who was a composite, every being is a composite, but in this ‘being’ of Renard, the composite parts were not working in harmony with each other. That was their sort of a dumb-downed version of this very strong concept of pure evil vying with pure good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>[Note: After the call I looked up the word ‘Renard.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is the French word for fox. Fox can denote trickery or cunning.

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">That’s what; there’s the whole story right there [from my side].</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We’re going to call in the Light and that means our invocation to create a protective energy. You are going to be part of the protective energy. When we do this, you might feel that energy come in. This is not a magic ritual; it’s a bunch of intentions that, when we intend something we start to make it happen.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Father-Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light to surround and protect each person on the call, listening to the replays and reading the transcripts and any negativity be taken to the highest realms of light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth. Right now, we invoke a group energy connection between all of us present on this line who would wish, of their own free will, to participate in that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If you’re new on the line, just stay in the background and watch and observe until you say, “Okay, I’m open to that”.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We do this while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One, to join with us and we create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I’ll mention that the way the Universe works, as we’ve learned to understand it, is: the entire Universe is one energy and everything in it is a subdivision of that energy, just as if you might have a house with electricity coming into it with all these electrical outlets. Different things plug into them and they all do different functions, but they’re all plugged into the same circuit.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The Universe is the same way; there’s one energy and all of us are plugged into that circuit. In the higher realms, beings, entities, recognize that they’re part of the same energy. In the lower realms like earth, people usually lose track of that experience. In this moment, we want to feel what we’re plugged into; we want to feel the connection. Not as an isolated, alienated being. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The Elohim and the Ra groups are actually us, but they’re expanded versions of us. They’re part of the same energy. We are contracted versions of them, but many of us came to this planet and took bodies, because one of the highest services anyone can do is to learn to be the ground-crew for this energy. They can help us, but they need people down here to work with.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">On these calls, many of us have experienced that and have agreed to do that. You don’t have to do anything, other than make the connection and open yourself up. You’ll end up being more loving and people feel your presence differently, but most of us have certain things we have to get through before we can do that. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The reason for these calls, one of my reasons, is to help you get through what you need to get through so that you can be of higher service while you’re alive. When you die, you have a greater connection to the other side and you don’t have to be afraid.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Do we have an opening comment from our Sources?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We spread our Love Light across the planet, not only to the people on the call, but to the light workers and to the workers who are working in areas of dangerous jobs: to the paramedics, to the medical workers. We spread light and support to all of them and our thanks for the work that they do. We appreciate each and every of you being on this call and the opportunity to connect with you, those that wish to be connected with.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. One question is, I don’t know the person’s name, but this not a personal question:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Besides the group souls that are communicating with us, are there other positive group souls interfacing with our realm that have different functions that you would like to share with us?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Yes, there are other groups that are interfacing; there are groups of angels in the angelic realm that are interfacing and they have their own specific jobs. They are guides and helpers and they work in the heavenly realm and they interface with the earth realm.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There are other groups that work in the area of </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">India</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> and they interface through some of the religious tenets in the area, with the people in that area and some of the rituals that they have and the burial rituals. They work to help transport beings to the other side. They think in a different language; however, their function is much the same.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We look at other countries and we see that there are other groups also; in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Africa</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> there is a group that is connected to help the African people to transition.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">So the answer is yes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. We had two people asking questions about the moon tonight. I’m going to just integrate their questions together under one umbrella.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">One thing is, that when people are reading about the moon or listening to George Noory or different metaphysical things, there is this idea that the moon might be artificial and that it is also a place for alien bases. And, there are funny structures on it that seem to have been made by intelligence. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In my studies of </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Egypt</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">, the word Ra became known as Amun Ra. Amun related to the moon and the moon is a receiving energy, as opposed to the sun. I came to the idea that the Amun Ra name was a service-to-self name and it wasn’t the highest name, even though religion has taken that and I believe amen is derivative from Amun.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">On the other hand, we have astrology which has all these ways of interpreting the moon’s influence. We have the Hebrew religion, which uses the moon as a calendar as opposed to the sun.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Can you share anything with us about the moon that might be helpful in understanding for those people who are asking those questions and that are curious? Finally, how do we relate to the moon as an energy?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. During certain times when there is a full moon, the moon has a very great pull upon the people of earth that are on the side where the moon is shining. It not only pulls the tides, but it pulls the molecules of the person’s body and it gets things moving within the body.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">As an individual tends to hold within his sphere stuckness-es and keeps things in balance and the moon, when the moon is full, can begin to unbalance those things. So things that a person has been holding within them can begin to become unbalanced. The person has to work harder to keep them in balance.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Of course, the best answer is to be able to clear those things so they are not in a person’s field to be pulled and pushed and come into play during certain cycles of the moon. There is less pull that there are times when this can act as an advantage for the person to make more contact, to be able to accomplish things. These are in the realm of astrology. There is information available on how the moon affects things during the waxing and the waning of the moon. Give us a moment.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The moon has functions which are not generally thought of and are taken for granted. It is a balance for earth, so that it can act as a protection for earth because of it’s interaction in electromagnetics; it can be a deflection for earth in some of the things coming its way from the sun or from other areas within the solar system.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There have been questions as to how the moon got there. It has been there for an extremely long time and it, during other cycles, has been able to be moved into place, so that it has the best advantage in connecting with earth. There were technologies—we look at how long ago—more than millions of years, in the area of billions of years, when earth was first colonized. It was looked at how earth could be set up to be a paradise for individuals to retreat to from other parts of the galaxy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There were technologies at that time for how to move other bodies into position and there were geometries that were known, about how to coordinate movements and what positioning would be best for protection of earth.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Those are our comments.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In general, we would call them service-to-others, although within the group there were service-to-self individuals who were working to make money or working for their own motives.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We have a question here from Helma. There’s a lot of talk about this period of time in the shift. I think Jesus said it, and she says the Mayan elders said it. The question is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Are we going to have three days of darkness when we won’t see the sun in this coming period of time?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It depends upon what you mean “in this coming period of time”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We can give you parameters to consider; we do not expect any untoward changes in the area of time, in the near area of time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There are some of the things that we see out there, possibilities, that could potentially happen at some point; we do not have a date and we do not see them within the next few years.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">One of the things is the melting of the glaciers makes a redistribution of weight upon the planet, which could make a movement within the earth’s crust to realign the weight; which, in a movement, a crustal movement, could create an apparent stopping of the sun. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This has happened in the past, millions of years ago and is some of the reasons that you find Woolly mammoths flash frozen in the north, in that they were in a climate that was temperate and then the crust moved.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">During the crustal movement, they were placed into a cold part of the planet as the whole crust moved. This is where some of the myths and legends come from about three days of darkness.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There is redistribution of weight in the taking of oil and minerals out of the land and this could even work in favor of individuals living on the earth plane, in that it may help with the redistribution of weight in a favorable way. But we do not see anything coming up right away.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Déjà-vu is when one has the feeling that something has happened before, that they have seen someone before, that they have been in the same place before. It often is the result of the person actually having been in another period of time, or known a person in another period of time, that is in the current moment, in the now, is reappearing in their life or they are reappearing in that location where they once were.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Then there is a connection in their memory bank between now and what happened then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It can be an entry-way into information about what has occurred to them in past lives. So it would be good to take a pen and paper and notebook and keep a record if you have moments of déjà-vu; it can be part of an opening into more knowledge about your past.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We have Claire and Jyoti both listening to our calls regularly and both of them have this circumstance where they feel they’re being haunted or occupied or taken over by other beings. Can you make any comment?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Claire sent in a message about that and she says: Things seem to be a little better. From your point of view, is she making progress?</span></p>

In the identifying within your own self to musical notes in alignment with your chakra system, this can help, and we see that vigilance is needed to bring yourself to excellent nutrition. There is work with die-off of viruses within your system, with biologicals within your system and detoxification.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We see there is improvement and to keep with the program that is working and to be mindful of having good nutrition. There is also other help that may be available through the clearing of, help with clearing of, biologicals from your system and clearing, cleaning your house, clearing it of old energies.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">With Jyoti, we suggest pursuing the work with nutrition and with the program for eliminating Lyme disease from the system, as that will bring a great deal of relief.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We will take that under submission and we will pursue that off the call.</span></p>

Next question is from Selena in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Seattle</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">. She is having unwanted visitors at night; I assume she means non-physical visitors. She wants them to go away and not bother her. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“It’s troubling to be awakened at night with things being poked into me while feeling like my energy is being drained away. Also, the pain in my head can be difficult to tolerate. I’d like to know what I can do so I can go to sleep and not have this occur. Can our Sources help? Can they speak with these energies to get them to leave me alone? They spoke to them before and things quieted down, but it seems like new recruits came to take over.”</span></p>

When one is lost on the other side, then it can come in through a portal. We are saying these entities are lost on the other side. They are seeking some kind of connection. We look at closing the portal so that they cannot move into your space.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">That is our answer.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. We have Kathleen in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Denver</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">. Let me get to her here. Kathleen is having a bad time; she’s having people break into her car. Let me find here her question. She’s having pain in her body, a lot of things. Here it is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In the past several years, she has had two cars stolen. She’s lost her clothes. The battery on the car was stolen; the driver’s window damaged. “I’m having days when I feel lots of pain.” Is there a metaphysical reason? I’m asking her question this way. She’s wants to know “Why is this happening?” </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I think I want to ask, if she doesn’t mind: Is there a metaphysical reason why she’s attracting this to her? Is it a karmic pattern from past lives? Is it something in her thought patterns? Why is this happening to her?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. There are two things happening here. One of them is, concerning the pain in your body, is to bring your body into a state of alkalinity, which then should help the pain and stiffness to ease off.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The next thing is that you are in an area which is bringing you down, as there is an energy in the area wherein—it’s the energy of taking advantage, of individuals that are trying to pull a fast one—to get something for free in a criminal way. This is an energy that is with a gang in the area, a group of individuals. We see the energy running through the area. It is an area that car thieves have a ring and they make a detrimental energy, a bad energy; the energy of thievery running between their houses.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This is a hard energy to deal with and brings the whole area down. We look at different ways, of the possibility of handling this. It is a little bit hard to keep clear of their energies, as they are out looking for marks.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We see that it is, in your area, something to be avoided. Keeping yourself squeaky clean can help you to some degree; however, the energies in the area, we keep thinking that there needs to be some police action to shut down this ring, although this ring attaches and connects to other things in the drug area and is fed also by that. It is almost as if it is in a corridor, an energy corridor, where it takes effect. At times, you move near that energy corridor, which then can bring you down.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Those are what we see. You may think of the possibility of checking out other areas that you feel the energy is uplifting. Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We’ve come to the end of our call. We have probably one minute. I thank you all for being here. We’ll take a moment in the silence and feel the energy. When you get off the call, hold it for a while. Some of you are feeling it, a sense of balance, a sense of connection. That’s always there; it’s just that we separate ourselves from it by our old patterns. That’s why these calls can be so helpful. If you keep coming into them, you can anchor that frequency as a new potential in your own being.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">On that note, if you asked a question and we didn’t get to it, ask it again next week, that’s okay. We’ll see you next time; Sunday grid healing, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">10:00 a.m.</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"></span></p>
