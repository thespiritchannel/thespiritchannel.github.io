<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;This is March 28th, 2011 Wynn Free.&nbsp; This is our Monday</p>
<p>night conference simulcast which is the simulcast between a</p>
<p>conference call and an internet broadcast.&nbsp; We’ve just kept our</p>
<p>format because we started as a conference call and actually the</p>
<p>conference line helps hold the energy for the call.&nbsp; This is a</p>
<p>rather unusual call because it explores the nature of</p>
<p>interdimensional communication, but not from an intellectual</p>
<p>source but with actual interdimensional sources that are</p>
<p>communicating on the call.&nbsp; Terry happens to be one of those</p>
<p>special people who is able to be a conduit for those messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things about our particular sources – just because</p>
<p>it’s interdimensional doesn’t mean that all people who do</p>
<p>channeling are doing the same thing.&nbsp; Just as if you are talking</p>
<p>to people who are members of the human race, you’d have as much</p>
<p>variations as you could imagine.&nbsp; In our case, we’re not</p>
<p>talking to discarnate entities, we’re not talking to individual</p>
<p>spirit forms, we’re talking to – how they describe themselves</p>
<p>as ‘group souls’.&nbsp; If the way they explain it is true, there</p>
<p>are a number of them working together, formulating the words that</p>
<p>come through Terry.&nbsp; There is an unusual aspect to the group</p>
<p>souls that we are communicating with and that is, aside from</p>
<p>getting information about how things work at a cosmic level,</p>
<p>we’re also able, many of us, to feel their energies.&nbsp; They</p>
<p>explain that they have the ability to project from where they are</p>
<p>the love light energy into this realm.&nbsp; Humans are receivers of</p>
<p>that energy.&nbsp; In fact, they’re a very important part of the</p>
<p>equation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens during the call is that there is a lot of</p>
<p>information – some of it that I bring through and some of it</p>
<p>that happens in our conversations.&nbsp; There’s also this energy</p>
<p>that’s on this call.&nbsp; Some of you can already feel it.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>people that have been on the call regularly have learned to tune</p>
<p>their antennas.&nbsp; As soon as they come into the call there is a</p>
<p>sensation, a feeling – I stop talking for a moment and you take</p>
<p>a look at the vibrations you’re feeling, you might notice the</p>
<p>energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every Monday we explore a topic, and the topic today is</p>
<p>‘Positive and Negative’ – we live on a planet that has</p>
<p>positive and negative.&nbsp; For many, it seems unfair that “Why are</p>
<p>there so many obstacles?&nbsp; Why is there so much suffering?&nbsp; Why do</p>
<p>people have hardships?&nbsp; If there’s a God, how did such a</p>
<p>difficult realm get established and why?”&nbsp; We’re going to be</p>
<p>exploring that tonight.&nbsp; Before I do I’m going to have Gjis</p>
<p>just greet some of the people on the conference line so they can</p>
<p>say hello and say their name and help hold the energy for the</p>
<p>call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Thank you everybody thank you for joining us – Gina,</p>
<p>Jackie, Dee, Andrea and Jim and some more people have joined.&nbsp; If</p>
<p>you want to do so, please say your name and city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mac:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;This is Mac Bugulu, Des Moines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Good evening Mac welcome to the call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mac:</strong>&nbsp; Good evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jean:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Jean, South Dakota.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:</strong>&nbsp; Hello Jeanne, how are you doing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zoe:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Zoë Sacramento.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Good evening Zoë, welcome to the call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zoe:</strong>&nbsp; Hi Gjis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suzanne:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Suzanne in Columbus Ohio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Hello Suzanne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suzanne:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Hi Gjis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cindy:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Cindy in Peoria Arizona.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Welcome to the call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Loretta:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Loretta in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lisa:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Hi Lisa from San Francisco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:</strong>&nbsp; Hello Lisa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Hi Michael in San Diego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Hello Michael. Welcome to the call Michael.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;That’s Sam when he says something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Sam?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; Yeah, the cat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Oh hi Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;He was just meowing and I give him the phone and he</p>
<p>shuts up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We have to introduce Sam and Nefertiti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I mean, he walks on my keyboard he wants to send emails</p>
<p>to his friends, probably to Nefertiti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gina:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Nefertiti has a new competition, a new friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; A new admirer; she has a new secret admirer.&nbsp; It’s</p>
<p>the Sam Cat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Just curious: Does anyone have any questions on the topic</p>
<p>that we’ve addressed for tonight?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; Yes, actually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;What’s your question Michael?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; We talk about duality and we talk about positive and</p>
<p>negative and we’re seeing that things are moving closer</p>
<p>together.&nbsp; Sometimes I have a problem talking about it being</p>
<p>either positive or negative because it’s creating a polarity</p>
<p>and I think what’s happening as we move towards oneness, those</p>
<p>polarities are dissolving.&nbsp; There’s euphemisms, then there’s</p>
<p>what you really mean.&nbsp; It seems that rather than just the</p>
<p>polarity of positive and negative – what was it called?&nbsp; In the</p>
<p>Kabbalah there’s seven Hermetic Laws and one of them is that</p>
<p>everything basically works kind of like a continuum.&nbsp; There’s</p>
<p>light and there’s dark; there’s light and there’s absence</p>
<p>of light.&nbsp; If you have two rooms with a door between them and</p>
<p>there’s light on in one room if you open the door that room</p>
<p>doesn’t become dark; the other room becomes light.&nbsp; I’m</p>
<p>looking for – its one thing I like to do – is to what shows</p>
<p>itself in the Universe again and again.&nbsp; I think that when we</p>
<p>talk about the dark forces we kind of make them an enemy and if</p>
<p>we make them an enemy we feed them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I think so, I think that’s true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;One thing that I’ve come to realize is that they are</p>
<p>trying to get back to be God, too.&nbsp; Maybe not the right way or</p>
<p>maybe there is the right way, I don’t know.&nbsp; The way they’re</p>
<p>doing it doesn’t look good to me that’s for sure and probably</p>
<p>not to anyone else on this line.&nbsp; What it comes down to is when</p>
<p>we’re looking at light and dark, I think we have to embrace the</p>
<p>darkness.&nbsp; You have to embrace the darkness in your own self if</p>
<p>you want to gain more light.&nbsp; If you want to be more conscious</p>
<p>you have to explore your own dark side.&nbsp; There’s God revealed</p>
<p>and then there’s God hidden and again there’s more duality.</p>
<p>I’m curious just how it all fits and works together and if we</p>
<p>can use that understanding to release opposition and let the</p>
<p>light in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Michael I think that is very insightful.&nbsp; Now I can’t</p>
<p>tell that story about the dark room and the light room.&nbsp; You</p>
<p>upstaged me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Sure you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;No, you already said it.&nbsp; Anyone else have a comment on</p>
<p>this particular topic?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zoe:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for that very much I enjoyed that a lot too.</p>
<p>This is Zoe.&nbsp; I wonder about asking them to talk about the</p>
<p>function of the dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The function of the dark – okay.&nbsp; Anyone else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I want to ask regarding the nature of duality in the near</p>
<p>future will there be significant differences between 2012 or 2017</p>
<p>– will there be significant changes for us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Terry, are you writing all this down?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; I didn’t hear the last thing that Gjis said; he said</p>
<p>“nature of duality in the near future” and then he faded out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; In other words: what’s the significance of 2012 and what</p>
<p>might shift, I think that’s what he means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:</strong>&nbsp; Will there be a noticeable difference with duality in the</p>
<p>near future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Anyone else have something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gina:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Yes, Wynn.&nbsp; Maybe the sources can comment on: certain days</p>
<p>are more difficult than others for us, especially those who are</p>
<p>tuned in to what’s happening and the energies going on.&nbsp; If</p>
<p>they can just give us some insight into how to deal with the</p>
<p>tough days or the challenging days – some of us may feel</p>
<p>depressed or we may feel just lost in sort of a way.&nbsp; Like, we</p>
<p>just put our hands up and we want this all to be over with</p>
<p>already kind of feelings.&nbsp; If that’s kind of making sense.&nbsp; If</p>
<p>they can just address that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Like Judy Garland in that version of somewhere over the</p>
<p>rainbow, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gina:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.&nbsp; Maybe tips on how to deal with those days that</p>
<p>are just more stormy than others or more tough or more</p>
<p>challenging than others?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Are you guys drinking a lot?&nbsp; I have a sense of humor</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zoe:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;This is Zoë again – the way they, whether those days</p>
<p>function even though they are difficult in a positive way for us</p>
<p>and what way would that be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I want to make my comment here on that.&nbsp; My key to this is</p>
<p>acceptance – that when you’re going through one of those days</p>
<p>to say to yourself “Okay this is one of those days” and just</p>
<p>keep going.&nbsp; Say “I’m open for it to lift as soon as it</p>
<p>does” - stop dwelling on it; getting obsessive with it.</p>
<p>That’s my experience.&nbsp; Sometimes calling somebody up that is a</p>
<p>light action that would love to hear from you and just chatting</p>
<p>with them.&nbsp; On those days it’s really hard to take the step</p>
<p>sometimes to talk to somebody because usually, I speak from my</p>
<p>own experience, it’s like “Oh my god I hope no one sees me</p>
<p>today,” because you feel shadowed or obscured and you’re not</p>
<p>going to be able to put out energy.&nbsp; So it’s a trick to move</p>
<p>through it gently.&nbsp; Usually it shifts gradually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all for bringing those things up.&nbsp; Anyone else have</p>
<p>something they want to say?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong>&nbsp; On those kinds of days, you just have to keep in mind that</p>
<p>it’s 10% event and 90% reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Who was that sharing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong>&nbsp; That’s Jim from Tomball, Texas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; 10% event and 90% reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jim:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I had a teacher years ago that said ”With our lives,</p>
<p>there’s 10% that we’re conscious of and 90% that we’re not</p>
<p>that goes on in other levels.”&nbsp; That’s interesting – okay</p>
<p>thank you.&nbsp; Anyone else have something they want to say?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dee:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Wynn, this is Dee from Missouri – my question is: when</p>
<p>it’s us going through a hard day as ourselves looking over it</p>
<p>or just saying let’s get through it, that’s not a real big</p>
<p>task.&nbsp; I mean it can be, but what about when you have somebody</p>
<p>around you that is going through a miserable, miserable day in</p>
<p>their mind and you tell them you love them, you give them</p>
<p>everything you can to lift them up and they don’t lift up –</p>
<p>can you address that, how we could maybe lift them up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; You tickle them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dee:</strong>&nbsp; It doesn’t work, I’m sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;If you can, one of the things just my comment, is you</p>
<p>can’t always lift somebody up, okay.&nbsp; Sometimes you can and</p>
<p>sometimes you can’t because they’re a whole other universe.</p>
<p>One of the tricks is not to get caught up in what they’re going</p>
<p>through and being able to hold the space inside yourself for</p>
<p>positivity regardless.&nbsp; Be there for them.&nbsp; Because once you get</p>
<p>pulled into feeling sorry for them or feeling like it’s your</p>
<p>responsibility, I think that’s a losing proposition because it</p>
<p>would be like: you can’t save someone who is drowning if you</p>
<p>jump into the water and they pull you down in.&nbsp; You have to stay</p>
<p>on the shore and keep holding the hand from the shoreline and not</p>
<p>from drowning with them.&nbsp; We’re amassing all these questions,</p>
<p>so we’ll see what our sources say.&nbsp; Anyone else have something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gijs:</strong>&nbsp; May I quickly add something to it?&nbsp; I’ve had great</p>
<p>experience with just having the intention being there near</p>
<p>somebody and sending love and light just silently where a</p>
<p>situation like a miracle changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I know it’s a trick because I’ve been around people</p>
<p>– I can say this, but I’ve been around people - especially</p>
<p>when your emotions are involved - that sometimes it seemed like</p>
<p>the negative was using the circumstance to keep me disabled.</p>
<p>It’s so tricky because I couldn’t get out of it even though I</p>
<p>know all this stuff I got stuck and disabled.&nbsp; It’s not easy</p>
<p>just to know what to do.&nbsp; Anyone else have something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; I think we’ve really all been talking about the same</p>
<p>thing in terms of how do you lift your vibrations?&nbsp; What happens?</p>
<p>You get stuck. How do you lift?&nbsp; How do you get out of it?&nbsp; Am I</p>
<p>muted?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Here, I’m muted.&nbsp; I’m sorry.&nbsp; I heard you Michael, I</p>
<p>was muted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; I wish everybody had a mute button you know sometimes</p>
<p>that would come in pretty darn handy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;It would be nice to go in the world and be able to mute</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; That’d be fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Go do your errands and say ‘mute.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; An undo button that would be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; There we go.&nbsp; Okay, I’m going to mute everybody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Terry, you’re still there right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I’m still here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Alright.&nbsp; One of the amazing things that I have learned</p>
<p>over the course of the last years as a result of all our</p>
<p>conversations, interdimensional conversations.&nbsp; It took me quite</p>
<p>a bit of time to really incorporate that and that was that</p>
<p>everyone – this idea that everyone is one, it’s easy to say</p>
<p>– just imagine that this huge oneness of energy keeps showing</p>
<p>up in it’s separate forms as you and me.&nbsp; Here we are in this</p>
<p>lifetime, right now, and all of us have had many other lifetimes</p>
<p>which we can’t remember.&nbsp; Some of us may have even been part of</p>
<p>the creation of this realm, and jumped into it and here we are.</p>
<p>All those aspects of our past are on some level still present,</p>
<p>but our memories are blank – except that when you hear it,</p>
<p>there’s a cellular resonance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you read history and you had a lifetime in a certain place,</p>
<p>there’s something that clicks.&nbsp; Recently we did some readings</p>
<p>for some people and they happened to go into their past life in</p>
<p>Atlantis or their last past life in Lemuria.&nbsp; When we do those</p>
<p>readings I’m always a little bit, it’s out of my control.&nbsp; I</p>
<p>hope the information resonates, but I can’t tell.&nbsp; I thank the</p>
<p>people that had the readings when they emailed me because it made</p>
<p>a big difference to both me and Terry, because there’s a huge</p>
<p>responsibility in bringing this stuff forth and I don’t want to</p>
<p>make a mistake and I don’t want to do anything that could</p>
<p>possibly be harmful.&nbsp; I don’t want to have a negative source</p>
<p>come through, which I don’t believe has happened - but I know</p>
<p>it’s possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; In every situation I kind of have to be open,</p>
<p>and so do you.&nbsp; Every time there’s channeling to never just let</p>
<p>your guard down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the thing that constantly validates our sources is the</p>
<p>loving energy we start to have with each other because in spite</p>
<p>of the fact that we do these calls three times a week and</p>
<p>you’re getting inundated with messages, from my point of view</p>
<p>there is nothing to follow.&nbsp; You may choose to give up your power</p>
<p>but there is nothing inherent in what we’re doing that requires</p>
<p>that.&nbsp; This is an adventure, and it’s an unusual adventure,</p>
<p>because we’re all moving forward with this unique contact with</p>
<p>other dimensions - or what seems to be.&nbsp; We’re all getting</p>
<p>privy to understandings that are fairly rare in this realm.&nbsp; How</p>
<p>did the positive negative, my quick take on this is that – we</p>
<p>can go back now, because if we’re talking to the Elohim and</p>
<p>they created this realm I can make a quick review on how this</p>
<p>works from the way they’ve explained it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially the physical world was created – of course they’re</p>
<p>still listening so please correct me if I say anything that you</p>
<p>find out of resonance, or if I’ve got something wrong.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>physical world was created, not with an understanding of what</p>
<p>would happen.&nbsp; It was created as an experiment of – if you can</p>
<p>imagine – a bunch of spirits that are just having a good time</p>
<p>and they can resonate and communicate with each other and somehow</p>
<p>or another they can project holograms and be aware of each other,</p>
<p>but there was no persistence.&nbsp; The idea was “Well, if we could</p>
<p>create persistence wouldn’t that be fun?”&nbsp; Persistence was</p>
<p>the beginning of the physical realm.&nbsp; But, there wasn’t a great</p>
<p>understanding completely of how it would unfold and as it</p>
<p>unfolded – because there was persistence, there was</p>
<p>possessions.&nbsp; Because there were possessions there was hierarchy,</p>
<p>because either I own it or you own it.&nbsp; Theoretically you could</p>
<p>have a society where there was no ownership.&nbsp; I remember there</p>
<p>were times when I watched hippies go into that and say “Well</p>
<p>everything is everyone’s” – communes – where people would</p>
<p>come in and they’d say “Just give us all your possessions and</p>
<p>you can live on our farm.”&nbsp; I’m not going to say that’s</p>
<p>right or wrong, but usually when somebody sets that up in this</p>
<p>realm it gets branded as a cult.&nbsp; I think the reason is because</p>
<p>once you give all your possessions up you have no options.&nbsp; If</p>
<p>doesn’t work for you you’re stuck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a trick, it’s not easy because in this realm we all need</p>
<p>the physical things to survive and to feel free and physical</p>
<p>things allow us to make decisions, to travel, to go out and have</p>
<p>dinner, to go see a concert – to do things which are uplifting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Being that’s true, the individual interprets it as well these</p>
<p>things make me feel free then more makes me feel freerer.&nbsp; Now,</p>
<p>not only am I going to worry about my freedom, but how about my</p>
<p>children’s freedom and my grandchildren’s freedom?&nbsp; There’s</p>
<p>a desire to create huge amounts of money that suddenly is going</p>
<p>to create a lot of freedom for people in the future that you’re</p>
<p>connected to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you set up the idea of reincarnation, I’m pretty sure this</p>
<p>is true.&nbsp; I haven’t asked it specifically, but I’m pretty</p>
<p>sure it’s true – that is:&nbsp; the act of creating a family and</p>
<p>children and grandchildren creates the opportunity for you to</p>
<p>reincarnate in that same family down the road.&nbsp; You’re</p>
<p>vibrationally connected, so someone knows on a subconscious</p>
<p>cellular level that’s true.&nbsp; They may not know it or think</p>
<p>about it consciously, but this is one of the drives to create</p>
<p>families and children.&nbsp; Because when you create a happy family,</p>
<p>you create an opportunity to incarnate in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember we did a reading for someone where they talked about</p>
<p>tribal love versus unconditional love.&nbsp; Tribal love is just what</p>
<p>it sounds like, it’s like you’re connected to your family,</p>
<p>you’re tightly round in with your group.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can extend</p>
<p>outside your family, it can connect to your tribe, your religion,</p>
<p>your church you go to, the particular community you live in.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>thing about it is, you get something back from those involvements</p>
<p>- it’s not unconditional.&nbsp; It can be beautiful and it can be</p>
<p>loving, but it’s not unconditional because you are tying your</p>
<p>energy field into that group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Excuse me, Wynn, the guys in the sky are knocking on the</p>
<p>door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The guys in the sky?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;You mean you want them to talk?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Wait a second.&nbsp; Terry?&nbsp; Terry, are you there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I’m here.&nbsp; … they’re knocking on the door?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Gjis is trying to push us to channel.&nbsp; It’s 6:31, we</p>
<p>have about 23 minutes.&nbsp; I’m just going to take another two or</p>
<p>three minutes because I want to make sure that those people</p>
<p>listening understand how the negative got founded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can follow my logic here, this tribal thing meant we have</p>
<p>to have more compared to that other tribe that doesn’t have it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It’s like whether it’s your tribe has more than theirs and</p>
<p>then we have to go get their land and we have to grow food and</p>
<p>they don’t have it.&nbsp; This has been the history of humankind.</p>
<p>Then someone breaks out of it and starts to set an example of</p>
<p>unconditional love.&nbsp; Unconditional love means love that goes out</p>
<p>but doesn’t need anything in return.&nbsp; It may get it, but it</p>
<p>doesn’t need it, it’s not requiring it, it’s just</p>
<p>free-flow.&nbsp; Each of you can look at yourself and say how much of</p>
<p>me is involved in tribal love, and how much of me is involved in</p>
<p>unconditional love?&nbsp; It doesn’t mean the two are mutually</p>
<p>exclusive.&nbsp; You can have a wonderful family and still have</p>
<p>unconditional love, because your family is a subset of you,</p>
<p>it’s not where your consciousness is totally engrossed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m going to call in the light – Terry are you ready?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; Alright.&nbsp; You don’t sound too anxious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; There are a lot of questions here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I did want to announce this experiment, but I’ll do it</p>
<p>after the channeling, okay?&nbsp; (There is) something that I want to</p>
<p>try this Saturday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Father Mother God we ask for the presence of the light to</p>
<p>surround and protect each person here, and any negativity be</p>
<p>taken to the higher realms of light and transmuted for the</p>
<p>highest good of all concerned.&nbsp; We see ourselves in the flow of</p>
<p>energy radiating from the center of the galaxy from the center of</p>
<p>the universe through the planets through the outer energy fields</p>
<p>of earth, through our bodies and grounded into the earth.&nbsp; Right</p>
<p>now we invoke a group consciousness while maintaining the</p>
<p>sovereign integrity of our souls.&nbsp; We invite those sources that</p>
<p>are positive, service to others, operating in the Law of One to</p>
<p>join with us as we create a protected space that only the</p>
<p>positive has access to.&nbsp; Anything not of that nature must leave</p>
<p>now.&nbsp; We await our sources to identify themselves and deal with</p>
<p>our topic in any way they see fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite</p>
<p>Creator.&nbsp; This is the 28th of March 2011 on planet earth.&nbsp; We</p>
<p>bring through the connection with planet earth, connecting it to</p>
<p>the higher vibrations of love - unconditional love.&nbsp; It is what</p>
<p>replenishes and nourishes the soul.&nbsp; Sometimes when an individual</p>
<p>is in the third dimension, they do not have access to this</p>
<p>unconditional love and flows from the earth realm move through</p>
<p>their life and they then can copy these unpleasant experiences</p>
<p>and experience negativity.&nbsp; The whole earth game is a plan</p>
<p>wherein an individual can learn to deal with lack and deal with</p>
<p>plenty and deal with the different emotions of individuals, and</p>
<p>their depression or their cheerfulness or their greediness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An individual can learn to establish their own center and keep</p>
<p>their own connection with the love light and keep bringing the</p>
<p>love light through, bring it in - in prayer, in wishes and hopes</p>
<p>and intentions – to individuals who are going through difficult</p>
<p>times.&nbsp; There are different levels of frustration wherein one</p>
<p>might experience different emotions and for instance, losing</p>
<p>their grounding.&nbsp; Having a grounding of shelter and food and</p>
<p>harmony can buoy one up.&nbsp; In losing that harmony, they can then</p>
<p>flounder and not know what to attach themselves to, so it is a</p>
<p>lesson in attaching one to the love light, to the grounding of</p>
<p>the love for one’s fellow man to the love from the higher</p>
<p>sources which is willing and able and ready to flood in upon one</p>
<p>when they seek it and sometimes in the losing of one’s economic</p>
<p>situation or one’s shelter or one’s food supply, it causes</p>
<p>individuals to group together and to re-realize what working</p>
<p>together in harmony with each other means in finding the</p>
<p>fulfillment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fulfillment is something that an individual is really working</p>
<p>towards, not towards having a lot of money or a lot of</p>
<p>possessions; what will bring them connection is fulfillment and</p>
<p>connecting with spirit and connecting with others in a spiritual</p>
<p>way.&nbsp; There are many emotions one can experience.&nbsp; They can go</p>
<p>from being cheerful to being frustrated to being angry to giving</p>
<p>up more to being sad, to feeling apathy in that they can’t do</p>
<p>anything.&nbsp; They can go into negativity wherein they may wish to</p>
<p>simply run off and hide and to not communicate at all.&nbsp; These are</p>
<p>all areas one can move into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned light and dark – light is the presence of an</p>
<p>energy, a connection, a spiritual connection.&nbsp; Dark is the</p>
<p>movement into separation, into aloneness, into no connection.</p>
<p>Dark is not bad, it is simply another side of the coin where one</p>
<p>is not connected.&nbsp; Spiritual disconnection does not bring</p>
<p>fulfillment, spiritual connection with others and the higher</p>
<p>forces and all that is, which one might call God, is a</p>
<p>fulfillment.&nbsp; One thing that has been mentioned is the absence of</p>
<p>light, the dark forces, the individuals who have moved into that</p>
<p>are trying to get back to the God too.&nbsp; They are trying to</p>
<p>short-cut the connection process and have reversed their response</p>
<p>and reaction into a striking out, an anger, a frustration, a</p>
<p>retaliation for not having been included, for not having been</p>
<p>connected.&nbsp; For having, perhaps by the parents or some other</p>
<p>individual, been suddenly disconnected and set adrift into their</p>
<p>own world - a disconnection.&nbsp; The people that have disconnected</p>
<p>that person many times have been disconnected previously</p>
<p>themselves and are striking back and have chosen the wrong target</p>
<p>as the real target would be whoever has disconnected them.&nbsp; We</p>
<p>hope these comments are helpful.&nbsp; Do you have further questions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I think one of the questions that everyone has, is when</p>
<p>people are feeling separated, when they are feeling dark, when</p>
<p>they are feeling all their angst, how should they deal –</p>
<p>especially when they’ve had moments when they have been</p>
<p>connected and not felt that.&nbsp; How can they best deal with that</p>
<p>aspect of what they’re going through?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;One thing is they can observe, because sometimes there</p>
<p>has been an incident in their past, either in their past life or</p>
<p>when they were a child in this life which has made them feel</p>
<p>disconnected.&nbsp; Perhaps they had a parent who themselves were</p>
<p>disconnected and that parent had heaped disconnection and abuse</p>
<p>upon the child.&nbsp; Then, the child feels isolated and alone and has</p>
<p>not developed the social skills to connect that the individual</p>
<p>needs to connect.&nbsp; So, that individual can observe him/herself</p>
<p>and can also find areas within themselves where they can feel</p>
<p>some sort of connection and they can observe other individuals</p>
<p>being warm and friendly toward them and then observe their</p>
<p>reactions.&nbsp; If their reactions are to withdraw in fear that the</p>
<p>individual showing them warmth and affection may be like some</p>
<p>character in their past who has been withdrawn, or it has not</p>
<p>been true.&nbsp; But, individuals can seek, within their experience,</p>
<p>to let little cracks and openings in, to let the warmth and love</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can go to the coffee shops and can observe other people</p>
<p>being friendly and chatting, and let it seep into some degree.</p>
<p>They can find music, something that they feel connected with.</p>
<p>The object is to begin to reconnect and to feel connected.&nbsp; Once</p>
<p>one feels connected then the isolation drops away and their need</p>
<p>for love can begin to be filled.&nbsp; They can observe themselves and</p>
<p>write down each day what good thing did they accomplish in the</p>
<p>day.&nbsp; They can observe when they are feeling connected and can</p>
<p>find circumstances – going to a dance, going on a chat room –</p>
<p>whatever the persons’ gradient may be to begin to connect.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>object is connection, to bring the love light in and to move the</p>
<p>darkness aside and fill the individual with warmth and love light</p>
<p>and know the individual is loved.&nbsp; They can come in on our calls</p>
<p>and connect with us and see the connections coming in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If one is experiencing disconnection do not be disheartened with</p>
<p>yourself.&nbsp; It is an opportunity for big growth where you may have</p>
<p>the opportunity to observe as if you were in a lab to observe</p>
<p>yourself and see where the roots for the disconnection lie.&nbsp; What</p>
<p>were the thoughts that happened before the disconnection?&nbsp; Was it</p>
<p>something material that you were counting on that went away and</p>
<p>now you are simply at sea and can’t ground to it anymore?&nbsp; For</p>
<p>instance money is a big thing, where if there is no money then it</p>
<p>sets someone at sea and they are not sure how to ground.&nbsp; One may</p>
<p>find new ways of grounding with individuals who can give and take</p>
<p>love light and bring warmth into their life, even if it is</p>
<p>opening a crack and just bringing through a little bit.&nbsp; Because,</p>
<p>once somebody experiences the love light and&nbsp; that someone loves</p>
<p>them, if they can experience even a little bit it is a big gain</p>
<p>that can lead to bigger advances in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; I have this idea, I said I was going to</p>
<p>announce it and no one knows it but me.&nbsp; So I’ll announce it</p>
<p>and see what you guys think of this and if you don’t think</p>
<p>it’s a good idea, we’ll can it.&nbsp; I have an idea to do a</p>
<p>rally, a telephone rally, maybe this Saturday or Sunday which I</p>
<p>will announce, and invite everyone who has been touched by our</p>
<p>work on the rally and to have a little pep kind of thing for</p>
<p>fifteen or twenty minutes, and then take a break and have them</p>
<p>invite someone else to call in on the line who has never heard of</p>
<p>us before – without trying to explain it, just say, “Could</p>
<p>you get on this line listen to this guy?”&nbsp; But, we’ll do a</p>
<p>talk and introduce this work to new people.&nbsp; What do you think of</p>
<p>that idea?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We are open to that idea and it is worth a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I know that many people that are touched by this work will</p>
<p>try to talk about it.&nbsp; It sounds like they’re crazy to their</p>
<p>friends.&nbsp; Maybe we’ll try it out this weekend and we’ll see</p>
<p>how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s 6:51.&nbsp; One comment I’ll make as I know many people feel</p>
<p>separated because they think they need their soul mate, the need</p>
<p>someone to love.&nbsp; Without someone to love they feel disconnected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;How can a person who has this deal with this in the best way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;One way would be to see when they move through their</p>
<p>day how they are connecting with others.&nbsp; Everyone needs others,</p>
<p>and if they do not have others they feel disconnected because</p>
<p>that connection with others is something that only a connection</p>
<p>with others can fulfill.&nbsp; But, there is the connection with</p>
<p>one’s own self and one, in evaluating and feeling one’s own</p>
<p>worth, it’s something that they need to fulfill from their own</p>
<p>self.&nbsp; They can do things in that arena that can fill within</p>
<p>themselves the need for the love of self and the need for the</p>
<p>feeling of self worth, so that they do not get needy and ask</p>
<p>others to constantly fill up that gap.&nbsp; However, the connection</p>
<p>with others is something that is needed, and they can fulfill</p>
<p>that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now an individual, if they are looking for a soul mate and they</p>
<p>have their conviction of self worth, can then begin keeping with</p>
<p>their own goals and their own projects, finding people with</p>
<p>similar goals and projects that they can move into co-working on</p>
<p>those goals with others.&nbsp; Then, this is a common ground for</p>
<p>individuals to build a relationship, rather than making the</p>
<p>relationship be the whole and the only goal.&nbsp; Because if one</p>
<p>makes the relationship the whole and the only goal, then after</p>
<p>the connection of good joy of walking down the street with a</p>
<p>good-looking person or the joy of going out to eat….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We have to stop, I’m sorry.&nbsp; It’s 6:55 and Gjis is</p>
<p>going to be mad because I was talking too long.&nbsp; I know Seth is</p>
<p>sitting there saying he’s got another show to put on.&nbsp; Excuse</p>
<p>for stopping that, and thank you so much for that great counsel</p>
<p>on this topic.&nbsp; Thank you all for being here.&nbsp; We’ll see some</p>
<p>of you on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We love you all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>
