If you got<br />my email for tonight, I wanted to structure this call in a little<br />different way. Normally on our Wednesday calls, people submit<br />questions and Terry channels the answers and if you are one of<br />those people who are new on the call, I will explain something,<br />as I see it, the way things work on these calls.</p>
<p>There is really two communications going on on these calls. One <br />is going from my voice, through the telephone into your ears into <br />your mind or I should say mine or Terry's or whatever you are <br />listening to. Your mind is there, sorting out information, deciding <br />what makes sense or what doesn't make sense. Sometimes there <br />is some wisdom on these calls that says, I understand that. Wisdom <br />is where somebody says something that you almost know, but you <br />didn't quite know it consciously and it kind of puts things together.</p>
<p>Another thing on these calls is they are all different, you can<br />never know what to expect and they are all fairly unplanned and<br />we are communicating with what explains themselves as group souls<br />or group matrices. The first kind of communication is in your<br />mind and the other kind is vibratory and many people on these<br />calls have felt energies and shifts and transformations that go<br />far beyond what's happening in your mind. The mind is thinking<br />all the time, and it wants to understand more and of course in<br />the western world the mind is very dominant. Most of us have had<br />some experience picking up vibrations, we call them vibrations<br />and we meet someone and they have good vibes, or you meet someone<br />else and they have bad vibes, and you don't want to be around<br />them.</p>
<p>So what's unusual on these calls, and this is something you<br />can't believe until you have the experience, and I can just<br />foreshadow it so that you'll keep coming and checking it out.<br />These group souls have the energy to project energy from their<br />dimension to our dimension. When there are people who are tuned<br />in and looking for the energies it gives them permission to do<br />that. Their general M.O is that, we don't do things unless we are<br />asked. Now as you start to come into these calls, these group<br />beings in other dimension sounds like unreachable, and yet on<br />these calls, there is a familiarity that happens and in some ways<br />they are as real as you and I.&nbsp; So you have to listen to them for a<br />while and the experience becomes like having a friend somewhere<br />else. It's not like you have to give up any power, you don't have<br />to defer anything, you don't have to believe them, you don't have<br />to prostrate yourself, you just have to feel their energy and the<br />neat thing about feeling their energy is that if feels like love.<br />It feels like something is loving me, so you love it back.</p>
<p>Now historically this has happened in different times in our period,<br />and people have that experience, and it's so awesome that<br />sometimes it's been relegated to the idea of God.&nbsp; But they are<br />not God in the way religion makes God out to be. I asked them<br />early on, do you really like it when humans worship you and they<br />said, not really. They said we are kind of your equals but we are<br />in another dimension. We are able to be your friends, to be your<br />equals and when you connect with them it lifts your vibration.</p>
<p>So we have experienced people on the call having healings. We have<br />experienced people changing patterns in their lives that were<br />chronic. We have experienced asking questions about things that<br />you think you could never get an answer to. We talk to them very<br />causally and I don't mean disrespectfully, very respectfully but<br />not in terms of giving up your power. The idea of this is not to<br />give up your power. You are all humans and you are all part of<br />All That Is, and each of you is, in your highest sense, able to<br />be a co-creator with All That Is, in your human body. I have<br />everything human.<br /><br />They explain they are group energies and they have the ability to<br />work with each other and work in a team and to separate into<br />councils and look at things that are needed. A good description<br />is if you are going listen to a group of musicians and they seem<br />to be connected to each other. When one musician plays something<br />the other musician feels it and knows what the others are playing<br />before they play it. There is a sense of joy and so we have two<br />groups souls and we are learning how to interact from them and<br />how we can benefit personally and as a planet.<br /><br />I am learning this just as you guys are. They don't say Wynn do<br />this or Wynn do that. When you are following orders you don't<br />become co-creators and it's not spontaneous. They don't exactly<br />know what to do in this realm to make it evolve and they learn<br />from us. What we are doing on these calls seems very unusual from<br />their perspective. There is no belief in anything, there is<br />nothing to follow, there is just showing up. There is all these<br />energies, the call is over and people feel self love and enough<br />people do this to say, how do they do that? It's not me. I am<br />like a bridge. I am allowing myself to connect to these energies<br />and everyone else connects with them. It's not a charismatic<br />thing. Even if I stop talking, there is energy in the space.<br /><br />On our Sunday grid healing calls, we focus on creating an energy<br />connection and when we have that connection we have the ability<br />to create intentions and the intentions instead of just being us<br />alone making an intention, we are coming together as a temporary<br />group energy in this realm and it's very powerful. Things can<br />happen that are beyond miraculous. It's one of these things where<br />you have to keep paying attention and prove to yourself. When we<br />do this we are expanding our own fields and are behind what can<br />be called a veil. On these calls there is an opportunity presented<br />to expand. You don't have to do anything. When you expand you<br />begin to have expansions in your own karma. We call the miracles<br />on our realm but in their realm it's very fluid and things happen<br />in a big flow. Here things are rigid. When we access these fluid<br />realms we have a chance to shift things in this realm. Sometimes<br />this turns into a healing. We have had times when we have put<br />things in the light and suddenly a hurricane changed direction.<br />They were talking to the hurricane through Terry and the<br />hurricane agreed to reduce it's power.<br /><br />If this is all true, we really need some good intentions on our<br />planet right now. There is stuff happening. When humans get<br />together like we are doing right now and all of you who are<br />listening to the replay, it creates a vortex for energy to come<br />in from other realms to come into this realm. Once I asked if<br />they could stop a nuclear weapon and they said, if there was<br />enough people asked. That is the kind of things we are doing<br />right now. We are coming together, saying, we need your help<br />guys.<br /><br />That does not mean the everything is going to change to perfectly<br />great, because it's not, but there are certain potential<br />disasters that maybe we can play a part in offsetting. I always<br />say, if we ask for anything, there are stipulations in the<br />asking. We can ask for anything, but the overall stipulation is<br />that it be for the highest good of all concerned and honoring<br />free will. What does that mean? It means that suppose somebody is<br />sick and they are sick because they are supposed to learn a<br />lesson and it's painful for those of us who are watching but they<br />haven't learned their lesson and until they learn they're lesson<br />they are going to have to be sick.</p>
<p>The higher good for all is that we don't know all the implications <br />but we honor that principle that is in effect. The other thing is <br />honoring free will. In this realm there are some boogie men; some really<br />negative people. People who want to enslave you, that want to<br />kill you, want to poison you and unfortunately we have to find a<br />way of dealing with those people. We cannot just say we want them<br />dead right on the spot because that dishonors their free will to<br />be who they are. If they did that and someone was actually<br />eliminated that you put the label evil on, that would come back<br />and visit us in the future.</p>
<p>Now how do you transform the negative? One of the ways is to be <br />soft and flowing, like in the Grand Canyon where water which is soft <br />breaks down the lock. So the more positive we can be, the more you <br />dis-empower what is negative and the more fear we have the more <br />we empower it because they thrive on fear.<br /><br />So, what we are going to do tonight is ask a few questions that<br />people have submitted and I am going to ask some questions about<br />how to best do this healing meeting we are having and how this<br />works. Is Daphne on the line?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Daphne:</strong> Hello.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> If you go along with this we are going to call in the light. Both<br />Daphne and Terry are the people who were in my life and brought<br />through these messages and brought through my initial introduction <br />to this and they are both on the line tonight. Do you feel up to answering <br />some questions?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Daphne:</strong> Yes<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> The key to this is when we are talking about any<br />channeling, and in particular mine, it doesn't mean we are<br />supposed to believe these things blindly, but how can we integrate<br />these things into our life on an ongoing basis. What happens is,<br />that you move out of just being a human and become a divine human,<br />and everyone likes that idea. Sometimes it's like surfacing<br />negative stuff, it's not like I described early and whammo, I'm<br />enlightened.</p>
<p>Each of us carries ancient patterns from other lifetimes and <br />invariably you are going to be put up against negative patterns. <br />When you start taking this seriously, the responsibility is so <br />awesome I would not say you are lucky. It's an honor and a privilege <br />to be able to be worthy to do this but it still takes dealing with your <br />humanness.</p>
<p>This is not meant to take your free will anyway, but just to enhance <br />what you already are. We have an invocation called <br />The Calling In Of The Light.<br /><br /><br />(Wynn calls in the light)<br /><br /><br />The topic today is how do we as a group on this line create the<br />clearest connection to create planetary transformation, to create<br />obstacles to the negative, utilizing our connection with the<br />higher realms. If Terry and Daphne go along, I will let our<br />Sources speak through each of them to answer this question. Is<br />that ok Daphne?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Daphne</strong>: Yes, that's fine<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Ok, so I am turning it over to Daphne now first and<br />particularly ask for Ra'An so we don't have anyone new giving me<br />different information than we are used to.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Daphne:</strong> Greetings, we come to you in the light of the One<br />Infinite Creator. We anchor the idea, pictel, glymp.<br /><br /><br /><br />( During Daphne's channeling, we direct the reader to listen to<br />the audio at this point to make it more clear.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />Terry, are you on the line? Can I turn it over to you?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Terry:</strong> Yes<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> We would like to ask that same question.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite<br />Creator. What happened just now was very profound in that we are<br />anchoring in the sphere of earth to bring the love light of our<br />realm into your realm, anchored and merged with consensus reality,<br />and moved into the plane of the lower consciousnesses, moved into<br />the plane of the earth realm. We continue to anchor as we speak.<br /><br />This anchoring is needed to raise the tone of the earth realm as<br />there are factors within the earth realm that do not wish change,<br />and do not wish to release their power and has anchored their<br />power into the financial economy; pocketbook of all of the people<br />of earth.</p>
<p>We look at Pauline, ( Before the recording of the call,<br />Pauline commented she was feeling the energy in her body.) and<br />see it is experiencing the effect of much turbulence and friction<br />between earth and other parts of earth, and we send love light to<br />Pauline, in her sensitivity is also anchoring and processing a<br />large effect that is playing upon the people's of earth in this<br />time.</p>
<p>We see a general angst among the individuals of certain<br />countries as change is un-anchored from the old and is changing<br />to a new paradigm, and it is hard to let go of the old anchors and<br />individuals, particularly some of those who have been empowered<br />are not amenable to release their power or to let the old<br />paradigm go, and individuals are protesting and really don't know<br />what the target of their protest is. &nbsp;To them it is the anchors,<br />for them it is Wall St. and they are demanding change, which will<br />help change the consensus reality, however behind the bankers,<br />behind Wall St, there are other individuals who cling,&nbsp;desperately, <br />to control the reins of finances and are unwilling,&nbsp;practically to <br />the death, to let them go.</p>
<p>We send love light to the whole of earth. We see some parts are doing <br />better than other parts. Some parts are into the change and other parts <br />are holding on to the old financial structures. We see that there may be<br />tribulation coming.</p>
<p>We thank Daphne for bringing through our grounding; our moving <br />down into the earth sphere, the anchoring forces bringing love light <br />into the sphere of men, hopefully it can touch the hearts of some of <br />those old paradigm people as they are placed to some degree, some <br />part of them, to send them love, to touch their heart and let them know <br />that if they move with love at this time, they can achieve the safety that <br />they so desire by clinging so heavily to their precarious, tenuous,<br />financial gain.</p>
<p>Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />So we are just going to take some silence now, and we are going to<br />hold this space of transformation, of asking for any of the<br />possible negative outcomes that would be violating the free will<br />of all those people who are reaching for higher ground, whether<br />that's comets, whether that's nuclear explosions, we ask for<br />synchronicities to block them. We ask for interventions to disable<br />them for the higher good of all concerned, and on behalf of all<br />the human light workers we are inwardly asking for this on the<br />planet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Ok. I'm not going to ask any questions. Those who have<br />submitted questions we will deal with them later. We are going to<br />bring this call to a close and ask that all of you hold the space<br />for a while after the call if you can, and all of you who are new,<br />please come on Sunday to what we call our planetary grid healing<br />and we focus on bringing these energies in on that call. All of<br />you here are part of this just by showing up, you are part of it,<br />you are the angelic light force and it's hard to realize this but<br />all you who are listening are part of these transformations and<br />thank you for being here.<br /><br />Wishing you all a very great evening. Terry and Daphne and all<br />the rest of you.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
