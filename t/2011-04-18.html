I didn’t talk to anybody beforehand so this is not pre-arranged, so I don’t know what people are going to say. I do know over the course of time that we’ve been doing these calls, a lot of people have sent me emails and have had many amazing things happen for them as a result of being on the calls. You know there’s this theory, I call it a theory, because when you deal with invisible realms you can’t see it, but it’s the response that happens that says “Hmm, I think this is really working.” </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">We have a voice that speaks through Terry that identifies itself as these two group souls that formed an association in another dimension so they could talk to us. One is the Ra group and one is Elohim group, and both of them have the ability to connect with our fields. Humans have energy fields that are expansive. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">We don’t see our fields, but it’s pretty clear that most people who are spiritual and metaphysical have some idea that there’s such a thing as a human energy field. Even the healing art of acupuncture is based on energy fields. We have an energy field, and we have a matrix that is not limited in its expansion; it can go on </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">ad infinitum. For most people it is limited because to have a body in this realm usually ends up causing what’s called ‘contraction’ of your energy field. There’s a veil; there’s a block to the energy. So, it’s not easy to get through that block. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Our sources exist on the other side of the block and in our conversations with them we’ve been learning how to feel their energies through the block. Many people have had experiences; and tinglings and expansions and lifting of depressions, and healings, and synchronicities – etc. etc. That’s what happens when your energy field expands, because in this realm things follow certain laws – the laws of the physical realm. In the higher dimensions, things are fluid. They’re not so rigid as they are here, and the laws are different and maybe in some certain places, there are no laws. When you can create a bridge between dimensions, you create the possibility of transforming or changing what would be the physical laws of this dimension. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">We can say that in theory, but on these calls there have been a number of things that have happened and I’m sure there are things that have happened that I don’t know about because people don’t always tell me. I get emails from people quite often about some kind of phenomenal event that happened to them. A phenomenal event could be a healing, it could be a synchronicity, it could be a lifting of an attitude or a pattern that you’ve had for your whole life or a good part of it - and suddenly, by magic, it’s dissolved away and you’re not in that pattern any more. We’ve had a lot of people that have had that. It could be a number of things; anything is possible when you start expanding your field. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">How do you expand your field? If I could say that in words if everyone would do it and we’d have a different planet. It’s not exactly something you can do with your mind. I would say maybe it’s akin to the experience of love. Like, if you love somebody the first time you’re with them you feel this exhilaration and you keep feeling it, keep feeling it and then, before you know it, you’re in a whole different state of mind because you’re feeling the love and unity. How did you get to feel that? By example – somehow you were in the field of that person and you felt their field and it was directed towards you and it actually combined with your field. When you have love, whether it’s spiritual love or romantic love, there are fields that combine. People combine fields. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">On this call we are experiencing fields from non-physical entities – in fact, they don’t have bodies as far as I know. We can’t see them, but we can feel their energies when they show up. That’s the amazing thing. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">By coming into the line, you have the potential to expand your field. I can’t promise that will happen for everyone, but it happens for a lot of people, and I guess one of the reasons it happens is because you’re ready for it to happen. If you want to expand your field you have to be willing to let go of something, you have to be willing to let go of your contraction; you have to be willing to let go of the fear of the unknown, because it’s a new experience. If you’re afraid of the unknown, you’ll hold yourself in contraction to that expansion and you have to come to those things and you have to come them, maybe to start with, by trusting what we’re doing. That’s why you have to come to the calls for a while, to make sure you trust it, make sure there are no agendas, (make sure) that nothing is trying to control you. When you open up to energies that you can’t see, you have to decide – you see that person just hung up. They didn’t want to go into the unknown. You have to decide that you trust the circumstance and be open to the circumstance. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Normally on our Monday calls, they vary – but, oftentimes I pick a topic and we question our sources and that’s one way to decide if you trust them – listen to the answers, listen to the feeling you get, your intuitions. The Elohim say they created the physical universe and we had a whole series of questions about how they created it. I would listen to their answers very carefully and say “Hmm, it makes sense, Terry couldn’t make that up.” They’re consistent over years; if I ask them anything now compared to what I asked five years ago, there’s a consistency in the point of view. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">This is like opening up to a new relationship, which is not a casual thing, it’s not a one-night stand. It will stay with you the rest of your life; it will enhance your life. It will stay with you beyond your life – I believe that’s true. I‘m still here so I can’t say for sure, but I have the idea that when you learn to connect with energies that are outside of this realm and you really connect with them and you become familiar with them, then when you die you’ll still be connected to those energies. So that protects you from a lot of other possibilities that could happen when you die that might not be so pleasant. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">On this call we are going to share - I hope you’ll share since I haven’t prearranged it and I don’t know who is going to speak up – I hope some of you will share some of the things that have happened to you as a result of being on the call that fit into the category, the topic of this call. Did you have a miracle? Did you change an attitude? Can you say you used to be like this, and now you’re like this? I got an email from somebody in Las Vegas who is probably not on the call, but she said since she’s come on the call she’s had all these synchronicities, she was going broke - she’s got a job, she’s making a lot of money, she found a new boyfriend and it’s all been very magical for her. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">That may not be happening for you, and you may have something else going on and maybe you need to be on the calls longer, read the materials over and over again, until you unbrainwash yourself from all the belief patterns that we’ve all held about our limitations. I guess I’ll start the ball rolling and I’ll tell two stories, I could probably tell ten stories, but I’ll two stories that I thought were extraordinary about things that happened on this line, or as a result of my connection with these sources. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Of course, the first one is my sister, which is the thing that really caught my attention when Daphne first started channeling. My sister was going in the hospital and I asked them if they could help my sister, because there was a serious chance that she wasn’t going to survive and they said they could. So, she survived this serious operation and I thought it was coincidence at first, then a few weeks later I got a call from my brother in law – something strange really happened because Joanne had to go in for tests, and the nurse said ,“There’s no cancer but there’s something wrong with the test because we can’t measure your lupus, your lupus has disappeared.” Now I was fairly convinced that they did an intervention, because lupus never goes away. I did a follow-up channeling and I asked them, “How did you guys do that?” They said “Well we projected a filter into her blood and took the lupus out.” I was overwhelmed – ‘overwhelmed’ is not even the right word. I’m dealing with a source, and I’m having conversations with them and you guys hear how casual our conversations are, and they just told me they projected a filter into my sister’s blood and took the lupus out which according to medicine, cannot happen. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">I asked them at another point, “Can you guys stop a nuclear weapon from going off?” And they said they could, but they needed enough people asking so they would have permission to do that. Their policy, as they have stated it, is to honor free will, which means they don’t intrude unless they’re asked. They can do interventions that are for the highest good of all concerned and don’t violate the free will of anyone else. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">I think there’s another aspect and that is some people need to go through something that’s very difficult because they’re clearing a pattern by going through that. Although they would wish it to go away immediately because it’s painful - they would miss a huge lesson if they didn’t stay with them until they had actually gotten through the pattern. So, when you ask for something and it doesn’t happen that may be one of the reasons. I was going to tell one more story. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">This is a story of a synchronicity, and I'll share this, it’s very funny actually. I forgot about this but I’ve been sharing it lately – this isn’t exactly in relationship to these calls but at a certain point in my life I think they were teaching me the power of my own thoughts. We’ve heard, when you think things, thoughts are real, thoughts create reality. I had an episode and it was a period in my life when I was selling things at fairs and I was at this one fair that was very, very crowded in Orange County, and I found a parking place near my selling spot and we sold out of product. I had to drive from Orange County to LA to buy some more product, and I didn’t want to lose my parking space. So I put a table in the parking space and I wrote a sign on the table that said if you park here you will get towed. I drove off and I hoped that my space would still be there when I came back. I came driving back and about five miles away from my destination there were all these clanking noises from the engine. I pulled into a gas station and I saw my water pump had blown; it was spouting water. So I was losing $100 and hour and I was not back at this fair and I was sitting in the gas station, twiddling my thumbs, saying, “How am I going to get back? How am I going to get this stuff back?” Three Hispanic guys were driving this huge flatbed tow truck; they were getting gas. I went up and I said ,“How much would you charge me to take my car five miles?” They said “$35” and I whipped out my money really fast and they put me on their truck and they drove me the five miles. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Of course, I was going back to the spot that I had saved for myself and they were lowering the car and the spot was still there. They were pushing my vehicle into the spot. There were these two guys leaning on a beer truck right in front of me and they were laughing – really laughing their heads off. I couldn’t imagine what was so funny. I asked them, “How come you’re laughing?” They said they saw my sign. This was the first time they ever saw anyone get towed back. What did my sign say? “If you park here you will be towed.” I should have said “If you park here after twelve noon, you will be towed.” I didn’t say that; I said “If you park here you will be towed.” So I had been parked there so I was towed. I have to believe that I created that. It was an impossible synchronicity. That’s the way things work when you start moving your energies into higher dimensions and integrating them with the earth plane; things happen that can’t normally happen. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">On that note, I’m going to shut up and if anyone on the line would like to share something of their experience – remember, it can be a synchronicity, a miracle, a personal transformation. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>

It’s good to be here, I’ve been gone a little while. I would like to share two things if I could and I'll hurry. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">One: the miracle wasn’t with me, it was with my husband, as you know. I’ve been coming on the calls for quite a while and he’s been pretty sick and he’s gone through some procedures with the doctor and the hospitals and different things. I wanted to say, I pray of course, to my higher powers every night, but I started including the Ra and Elohim in my prayers and asking for things. And, my husband is getting better. He’s not perfect of course, but he’s getting better. In the last three days he’s had a quality of life that he hasn’t had for a long, long time. I attribute that to me coming on these calls and getting the energies and them being in my life daily. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">The other thing, I would call this a miracle too – I’m growing as a person. I’m realizing things that I never realized before, kind of like patterns that I’ve lived all my life. I’ve lived a terrible life of abuse; not that I want sympathy, I don’t. I’ve learned a lot from it and I’m glad I went through what I went through. Anyhow, just the other day a lady called me that doesn’t even know me, she said that she was proud of me. It was sweet of her to say that, it’s nice to get praise. It dawned on me that “I need to be proud of myself.” I don’t need validation as far as what I do or to go to somebody and have them approve – ‘approval’, that’s my word. I realize now that I don’t need other people’s approval, I need my approval. I’m growing so much as a person it’s ridiculous, and I’m growing at a very fast rate. I actually have asked on the Wednesday night call several times of the Ra’an what they thought I should be doing. I know now what I should be doing and I’m working toward that; it’s going to be where I can help people, which is wonderful. To grow as a person and realize who you are and what you are and (to know) the things that you really need to be learning. Like you were saying, I’ve learned some really neat lessons lately and I didn’t take them as bad, I took them as, “Hey, that’s a good lesson.” A year ago even I wouldn’t even thought that. I wouldn’t even thought I was learning a lesson. I’m very grateful to be on these calls and in the energy. I feel the energy daily in my life, it’s not just on these calls now, it’s with me always. It’s very beneficial to me. I don’t think I could get through the things that I’ve been going through if it wasn’t for you and Terry and the Ra’an. </span></span></p>

Since I’ve been on the calls, I’ve given up those addiction issues which I later learned have plagued me for a couple of lifetimes. I’ve learned to deal with the fear. Also, I’ve learned that I had attached entities to me from past lives and they supposedly got them to cross over so I think that’s lifted a lot off of me. So I can get back to being my higher self instead of that lower, more human side - covering up the scary stuff that happened when I was a kid with all the visitations and negative entities and all that that has gone on, all that. </span></span></span></span></p>

I’ve had a lot of help from what I call the good energies, I call them. I had suffered from depression for many years, but recently I had an awful lot of grief and I was panicking, so out of control. I took a walk and I had forgotten to ask for help from this group. I was really desperate and I asked them to ground me and take away the stress. I immediately felt better – it doesn’t sound like much, the truth is I can’t prove most of the things that come to mind that have been helps and miracles and things, so I will go onto something that’s more tangible because it’s the only thing that I say is entirely up to them and it’s really tangible. </span></span></span></span></p>

I just had to buy it and I took it away. I came on the call one time, and then I went to Venice Beach with a friend and I came back. On March the 8</span></span><sup><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">th</span></span></sup><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4"> at 6:00 p.m. I called Wynn and I begged him for help, I was lying on my bed and I felt like I was dying. I had the swine flu, I had been screaming for hours. Really, I was just in agony. I felt like I was dying, but really I wanted to leave it was so bad. I could not help myself at all. I managed to drag my land line onto the bed, dialed the number and I don’t know what I said: “I’m dying here, is there anything you can do?” He said something like “It’s not a healing call tonight, but if you” – I forget exactly what he said – but anyway, he said enough for me to understand that I should ask the energies to help me, and I followed his direction and the next thing I knew, the pain was gone. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">I was out of my body for 45 minutes because I have no recollection from 6:00 when I called until just a few minutes before 7:00 when I heard them say the call is over, at which point I was lying in the bed and the pain was completely gone. This was pain that had been going on for well over 24 hours, and I was fine. I was not completely cured from the swine flu, but I was cured enough not to want to die and to be able to sleep and not have to go to the emergency room. That’s for sure definitely for me, because the mind will doubt everything else and question it and “Maybe there was intervention from this group, that group” and I was doing this, that – and I was doing other things. But with this, it’s clear to me that this was the intervention of this group and the good intentions of everybody on the line also, who completely assisted me beyond that point with their asking and their good will for me. That’s all I have to say. </span></span></p>

He had said to me on New Year’s Day, he said “The number one gift I’d like to receive this year is for my warts to be gone.” He had these for over a year. The next Sunday call, a gentleman asked for help with his warts and then I kind of tagged onto that. On Monday, the very next day, Monday morning – my wife who is very skeptical about the calls I do with you folks, she called me at my work she said “I can’t believe it but Eddy’s warts are disappearing.” So that happened overnight, it’s just a miracle.

Two or three Sundays ago, when we had our call I mentioned about my brother. It’s been very difficult trying to get along with him and I mentioned that he was driving me crazy but I was going to pray for his happiness. When the Ra’an were making their comments they sent love and light to my brother and me and I thought that was really nice. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">For some time now, since my mother died actually eleven years ago, my brother is in charge of a medical trust for me and so we’ve had to be in touch. I found him to be very emotionally disturbed, sometimes even somewhat sociopathic or totally unaware of another person’s feelings. He’s been very cruel, very mean-spirited. I don’t know what I did, what he has against me, what he thinks I did to him. He gets his feelings hurt over every little thing and he’s always making up stories about me, about terrible things I am and do and I just don’t know where he gets his ideas. I end up having very bizarre experiences with him. So when he starts yelling at me in an authoritarian tone, I say something really calm and relaxed, and I simply tell him I’m going to get off the phone now. Then he gets from that I was screaming my head off, which I never did. It’s like he can’t hear me be calm because he’s not calm. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Anyway, I was really hoping that we could be close, and it doesn’t seem like that’s possible. Every time I talk to him it’s like “Oh, what is it now?”, or every time he sends me a letter. That afternoon after the Ra’an said that we’re sending love and light to you and your brother, my brother called me hours after the call and we had to talk about what was going on with the trust. I have never heard him sound so cool, calm and collected and no insults, no treating me with disrespect – I just don’t know where it comes from. It was so unusual a call, and I ended up finding myself saying “Nice talking”, which I never say to him because it’s never nice, and not only that but the following Sunday he had to call me and it was the same thing. We could stay on the phone for more than fifteen minutes without him getting excited. He’s very excitable. And, the same thing happened. </span></span></p>

It was very, very noticeable, the difference. I wanted to share that. </span></span></p>

I have to say “This little miracle here that we’re actually doing this.” Going from the place where I first had this experience of talking to these guys and saying for three years “Can this be real? Can this be real? Can this be real?” Suddenly, we have a group of people listening to these calls, probably in the hundreds, that it’s making a difference for many of their lives. It’s kind of like magic. I’m sitting here watching it and saying, “Man how are we doing this?”</span></span></span></span></p>

I was almost scared to say directly what was going on because I didn’t think anyone would believe it. I used to start the calls all the time by telling my story and telling the story of how I met Daphne and Terry. Then people would complain “Wynn we’re so sick of hearing your story.” I didn’t really know how to introduce it, because I don’t want people to believe it blindly. </span></span></p>

Terry, did you want to share anything? </span></span></p>

To be able to be with the Elohim, say when they’re looking over the earth and they’re talking to a hurricane or they are talking to a storm – to see everything from that perspective has been really amazing. To see harsh energy on the phone line dissipating, or energy shifting. It’s been a real honor to be a part of it. </span></span></span></span></p>

Is there a softening of the energy? Do you move into a more cheerful space where everything feels like it’s going to be okay, even if it’s for an instant? There is the energy that rides with us in the connection. Just feeling, this energy, can help you stabilize and can help you bring the things to yourself that are helpful and are good for the soul. </span></span></span></span></p>

So when you sense this you may think that is part of your mind but observe this phenomena. Although the energy connection has triggered the mind and the body, it is the trigger from us that has set this into motion. This is something that we have noted, and just because it is in your mind then do not assume that it is of your mind.</span></span></span></span></p>

Thank Terry and all the people volunteering. I also thank everybody who is listening to all the replays, because they said the same energy is on the replay line as it is on the call. All of you are doing a great service just by being here, and helping to anchor these energies into physical reality. You may not understand that at first, but after a while you’ll get it, that you start to learn how to hold these higher energies in your field and you start, without trying, just uplifting the people around you. It’s really important now, because with all these changes going on there is so much potential for fear and panic about what’s going to happen, and we need it to hold the space of peace.</span></span></p>
