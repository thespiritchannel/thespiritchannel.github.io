This is </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Wednesday, November 7, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">, fast approaching </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">December 21<sup>st</sup>, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">. My name is Wynn Free and this is our Wednesday call, where people send questions and we ask your questions. I always tell people, if I don’t ask your question tonight, feel free to ask it again and again. If I don’t think it’s appropriate, I’ll send you an email back. We don’t have time to do all the questions that people are asking, so we do the best we can.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Of course, what we’re doing is communicating with what says they are intelligences in other dimensions; they say they created this realm and they say they can look down and see us. Particularly when we’re on these calls, they pay attention. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Many people have experienced this; this happens particularly on our Sunday call. These Sources also can send energy into this realm to us, energy that many people can feel, that seems to make them feel better or uplifted, more loving. Occasionally, people have miracles or something happens that wouldn’t happen by the normal laws of the Universe.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">While we’re doing these calls you can pay attention to two things. You can pay attention to the information that comes in and you can pay attention to the energy around you and see if you can learn a bit about that energy and how it works. There are a lot of advantages to making that connection.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">There are always a bunch of you who are coming into the lines regularly; then there are always some people that are checking us out for the first time. This is not anything that is normal. In other words, this idea that there’s this energy from a Source in another dimension that can come into your space is a fairly unusual phenomenon. It’s one you have to check out.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">If I was checking out this line, if I had discovered this, I’d be saying, “Is this real? Is Wynn delusional?” That’s why you have to read my story. Then after you decide that it’s real you have to ask yourself, “Is it positive? Is there anything here that has an agenda or is trying to control me?” Those are the criteria because you’re not supposed to give up your power and we’re not supposed to define your truth.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break;" /> <br style="mso-special-character: line-break;" /> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">This is a circumstance, a situation, where we are experiencing this together; we’re kind of on a train, an energy train and I’m on the train with you. When I show up, I’ve learned how to steer the train, only by serendipity, only by showing up and showing up, not through any special knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">I would never say I’m a master; I’m just a guy that kept showing up. If I do this, they do that; when we do this, people seem to have a good experience. We kept refining and refining everything up to the point where we give the appearance that we look like we know what we’re doing. I guess in a sense we do, because we keep doing it; we’ve learned when we do this, this works.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Somebody asked the question, “How do I learn to meditate better?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">My partner and associate Terry Brown, are you there? Hello, Terry.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes, I’m here.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I thought I would just take a shot at answering that question; then we’ll go back into the questions for this evening.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Meditation is to still your mind, go into the center of yourself and feel yourself; who you really are. Of course, there are techniques: there are breathing techniques; there are all kinds of things that people will teach you: “If you do this, you will have a deeper meditation.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">My take on this is, that every one of us is in our own reality-box. Do you follow what I mean by that? We have a reality system. Some people have more expanded reality systems and some people have more contracted reality systems. Your reality system sets the limits of your ability to perceive the world around you, because you have to perceive it through your reality system.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">When you start to meditate, usually your experience of the meditations will stay within your reality system no matter what you do, with minor variations. You’ll be meditating and you’ll be thinking of your children, or your wife, or naked women, or “I’ve got to eat” and “I’ve got to get my mind to stop”. Yet it all dances around your reality system. To have a really successful meditation, you have to expand beyond your reality system.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">One of the things we’re doing on these calls is setting a reference point for a rather large reality system. Particularly on our Sunday call. If you’re not coming into our Sunday call and you’re curious about our work, you owe it to yourself to check it out. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">On the Sunday call we focus on the experience of that expanded reality. On our Monday and Wednesday calls we’re talking about information and there is the expanded reality on the call, but it’s not focused upon. Our Sunday call is focused on it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Once you have the experience of expanding beyond your own reality system, you can then have a reference point. When you go in to say, “I want to meditate” and you shut your eyes, immediately you have the reference point of that expanded space and you can potentially go there.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Even thinking about someone you love, if you really love somebody, when you think about them you move into an expanded reality. I would venture to speculate that if you really love someone, when you think of them your energy-field moves to where they are and if you imagine you can feel them inside of you, how it feels to feel them, then you’re probably there.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">When I have this experience with somebody, I usually have little phenomena that go along with it. For example, I’ll be sending them an email and I just finished putting the send button and I get an email from them. They were sending me their email in the exact moment that I was sending them their email.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">When you start to combine energies like that, people get psychic. When you start thinking about someone they start thinking about you. Now, you’re in an expanded, meditative state. What I’m saying is different from some of the standard Zen Buddhist ways of saying things. What I think, say for example in a Zen situation where people sit in a room and meditate, is that they’re having group energy. In their group energy they are combining energies and they go into an expanded space because of that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">On that note, I’m going to stop talking about this. I’m going to talk to Terry or to our Sources through Terry and ask them some questions. Are you ready, Terry? </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">We’re going to start.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Father-Mother God we ask for the presence of the Light to surround and protect Terry, myself and everyone on this line and any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth. Right now, we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One, to join with us and we create a protected space that only the positive has access to. Anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">I’d like to point out that some of you, as I said that, got very peaceful; you got very centered. I suggest that you have just moved into an expanded space. You can see the reference point for that. When you go to meditate, try to bring that back in. If you keep coming on to these calls, eventually you’ll do it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Do we have our Sources present? Would they like to greet us?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">As we are present, we see an area above California, Oregon, Nevada, some parts of Utah, some parts of Arizona that are like a different energy is over this area, which distorts the wave-lengths from their normal wave-lengths. If you live in this area, you may notice that things seem a little bit ‘off’; that the energy is not exactly as it was a few weeks ago. There are, above the area, HAARP waves that are throwing things a little bit off; also, Mercury and the stars are throwing a little bit of energy that is not straightforward into the mix.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">So if you can just move forward and allow for that distortion and set it aside and move forward, then you will find easier going and will not have so many conflicts with other people at this time, as these energies tend to irritate individuals and to make it harder for them to have loving communications.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">We see similar vibrations over the Northeastern states of </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">New Jersey</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Pennsylvania</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Connecticut</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Massachusetts</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">New York</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;"> and </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Washington</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">D.C.</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;"> These are like bubbles of energy that add a little bit confusion into the mix of everything else.

This first question is from Anna in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">California</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">.

She has a son who had a seizure. I believe he’s seven years old. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">After the seizure his personality and things changed from him. Anna is his mother and she wondering, did something take control of him? Did he get possessed when he had that seizure? If he did, is there anything she can do?</span></p>

We do see that there was a change and that there was another that took some control at that point. We see that you know who your son is and you will see him there and be very loving to him and encourage him to be who he really is. We take a look further.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">We see the interaction and that it is partially with your son’s consent. We look further. If your son would ask the intruding influence to vacate, that one would vacate. We suggest that you, since you know your son, give love to the aspect that is him and to pray that the intruding aspect will find his way past the situation. We send love to your son, that he does not need this other influence to express harsh aspects that he feels unable to express.</span></p>

She’s even getting good at dropping into it herself multiple times a day. Yes, time can and does work differently and things can get done more rapidly and effectively. Those of you that are listening, Laura is an example of someone who has been learning to pick up the frequencies on this line, bring them into her own life and make a shift in the way she perceives the world and functions in it. She says:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">“It’s almost like someone else is helping you do things way beyond your own capacity. It’s wonderful, but it kind of leaves me disoriented and shook up a bit, perhaps because I’m not used to it. I told myself the other day I should definitely try to get used to it if this is going to be the new norm. The question is “How?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">I’d like any information about how to function for longer periods with that open-hearted feeling so it begins to feel more normal? Thank you.”</span></p>

We feel the heart opening here and our energy hearts open in response. You do not need to have this experience all at once; you can turn it on and turn it off so that you can gauge how much of it you can experience. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">You can move back into three-dimensional time; you can thus experience the differences in them. Take the higher realm time a little bit at a time, a little bit here and a little bit there, until you get used to it without the disorientation. You can control who much of it you experience and how much of it you don’t. So take yourself on a gradient, so that you can fully experience the difference and have control over the change.</span></p>

We had a question from someone; a lot of people have this question. There’s this idea that we’re going into 4-D (some people} and graduating this realm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The question is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">“If you successfully end up in 4D, what is it going to feel like to be in 4D?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. You are already non-linearly in 4D, in your astral body. You can move back and forth from 3D to 4D simply by a change of focus. Although you are not focusing on 4D, if you change your focus you can begin to feel what it is like. It is lighter; you have the ability to move in your astral body more easily. You can escape the bounds of the body, although you are still tethered with the body and you can experience travel, planet and space travel, to other locations tethered to your body to experience the differences.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Even in your body now, when you re-focus, you can then know what it is like to operate in the fourth dimension. The, we would say, ‘structure’ of your 4D matrix is much lighter, much finer and has much more light associated with it than when you are in your body in the third dimension and focused in the third dimension.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">So you can learn to find out more about it by shifting your focus into the fourth dimension, the astral body. You can learn to leave your body, your physical body and move with your astral body. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">It is an exploration that can be quite exciting and you can then learn for yourself what it is like. Your astral body has a tendency to glow as you connect with the higher dimensions, the higher densities, to shine like light shining on jewels. It is an uplifting experience.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Next question is from Steve in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Mitchell</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">South Dakota</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">. He talks about something that shamans do and healers, called ‘soul retrieval’. The idea is that people have lost fragments of their soul caused by traumatic or painful life experiences. Perhaps that also equates with the idea of fragmented souls of people in nuclear explosions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">He believes he has lost some fragments of his soul. Are these soul retrievals beneficial?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Of course, I’m going to just comment. All those kinds of things really depend on who you are working with for sure. Different people bring in different energies and they can call it the same thing but it may not be. I believe the idea that he’s talking about, people who have separated from part of their energy because of trauma or pain; I believe that’s true. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">You could answer the question about soul retrievals, but maybe you could also answer it in a more broad-based way, as to how someone who has lost fragments of their soul through pain can heal that. Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. One of the most beneficial things a person can do is to release the things that are not them. In travelling through their lifetimes, it is usual, in fact, that individuals have picked up other soul travelers, that in atomic explosions or any explosions, if the individual is in an explosion that has another person in the same explosion, what happens is, it resets both individuals to the same time, the same location, the same place; it resets them at the same time that their body matrix is lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">The individuals then become confused and do not know how to hang on to what might be left and they may hang on to each other. Then they go through life experiences believing that they are the same being, as they have been reset to the same location and time at that one incident. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Then at some later time they may have trauma. This trauma may begin as the individuals realize that they are separate, really; they had separate tracks before they got together. Then they may begin to let go of each other. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">You may have someone that has multiple personalities or someone that has fragmented parts, or they may have what the psychiatrists might term ‘schizophrenia’. There is a big movement to get the pieces back if some of these entities leave.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">We suggest that if the entity, which may have been with the individual person for quite a while, does leave, that the individual can let that part go and wish that part well and not try to pull it back, as the individual may be realizing, finally, who it really is and may be allowed then to resume its own path in life. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">So, we would suggest if there are—we don’t like to call them ‘fragments’, as we consider them entities or beings—that these beings be allowed to expand and to find their way; so not to try to call them back. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">When an entity leaves, one may experience emptiness in that area, or something missing. The entity can take with it things that a person hasn’t liked about themselves. Things can simply leave at that point, as the entity takes them with them. It may be that talents or gifts that the entity may have had, now the whole does not have access to. So, there may be significant changes and one may miss them; one might miss the interaction within their own matrix.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">We suggest observation to see exactly what is going on there and remembering what was there; when did it leave and checking with one’s own center to see if one can tell the differences between themselves and the piece or part that has left. Everyone is on a path to growth and you are in a magnificent position for future growth within yourself by even noticing that what you call ‘fragments’ have left.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">If someone has fragments or what that person’s calling<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>‘soul retrieval issues’ and they have intimate relationships with another person, is it possible that fragments transfer from one person to the other?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That is very possible; fragments can transfer from one person to another during sex. They can transfer even when there’s a court-ship going on; then, one person can send these entities to the other person and it is almost as if it is taking place subconsciously. They can exchange entities, yes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>How about drinking and drugs? Like if you go into a bar and you’re getting g drunk with someone. Could that cause an exchange of fragments?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes; as an individual lets go under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they may then leave their body more unprotected against entry of other entities and they may be more open, their body may be left more open, to being taken over. We don’t wish to say the word ‘invaded’, but to be left open for control of other entities that are looking for a situation they can move in on.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">We have a question from Debra; she’s in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Cedar Park</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Texas</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">. Her question is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Do people’s paths change day-to-day depending on the choices we make? Or are some things just meant to happen and that’s it?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">She had a psychic reading; any time you have a psychic reading you always open yourself up—this is me making a comment here—to influences that may be ‘lesser than’. Psychics don’t always come from high, wise places.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Another thing is, there’s a thing where psychics read something in the moment and if you’re on a high path, the moment you’re in can change very rapidly and they were only reading the outcomes on the basis of how the energies were at that moment.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">With that being said, I’ll continue with the question:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">She had a psychic reading done by a person that she feels comfortable with, and she predicted: my daughter, who is sixteen years old, would not have a career in professional dance, which is what she really wants to plan for and pursue, because of an injury that will happen. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">“Can that type of circumstance change? Thank you, Deb”.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">In other words, the psychic was predicting that the daughter would have an injury that would prevent her from being a successful dancer.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. That is a very good question. The answer is that: Yes; circumstances can change. If the psychic was seeing something which could be in the psychic’s own field, she may not have been connected totally with the daughter, but if she was seeing something connected with the daughter’s future, then the daughter can take a look and see that she goes to lengths to analyze what negative circumstances might be possible in her environment. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Is the daughter being careful to have shoes that do not injure the feet? Is there something that can be observed in what the daughter is doing that could lead to injury?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">We look at different fields of dance; for instance, we give an example. We do not say that this applies totally to your daughter but it gives an example to watch for:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">(Some) ballet shoes are made by companies that do not consider the protection of the child ballet dancer’s feet. When a child is wearing a ballet shoe, the weight should not be on the toes. If the weight is on the toes or if whatever shoes the individual is wearing, injure or hurt the feet during the dance, then they should look for a different pair of shoes. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">For whatever shoes the dancer is wearing, they should be comfortable on the feet and when practicing a dance, should not place any pressure on the feet that are potentially dangerous or cause pain to the child. So, one can take the psychic’s vision and analyze all of the aspects of the daughter’s dance and see if there is anything about this that would potentially create an injury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">On a broader scope, if there is some agreement that the child has made that there would be an incident or something happen, this can be changed and this would be up to your daughter.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">If there is such a thing, it would be up to your daughter to change the agreement, to look at the situation and see if there is anything that the daughter has within her own intention or her own frame that would set her up for some type of injury. Is there some agreement or some thing that needs to be worked through for a lesson in growth for the daughter? If she observes there is something there of that nature, then she can change it if she wishes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">This is an aspect that concerns your daughter and we look at the interaction between the psychic and you and your daughter. We ask, “Did your daughter, herself, want this reading? What is your daughter’s interest in such a reading? Would your daughter be interested in taking a look and changing anything that might be there? Have you discussed it with your daughter?” </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">The psychic is reading, in a sense, for the daughter, but did your daughter wish for the reading?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">Those are our comments; we hope that helps. We turn it back over to Wynn.</span></p>

But it is like setting a machine over the control of the energies in those areas.</span></p>
