<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is December 5<sup>th</sup>, 2012. We are Wynn Free and Terry Brown in Sedona, broadcasting live on the internet all over the world; we’re locally on a conference call line. This is the call where people submit questions. Let’s see if there are any good questions that came in—animals on other planets, alright. People hearing high frequency in their ears, those are the latest submissions. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In case you happen to be listening to our call for the first time, my name is Wynn Free. In 1999 I had a very close introduction to what I call, “inter-dimensional communication”, beings in other realms that have something to say to us, and something to contribute to us. It started out with David Wilcock and writing the book <i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce? </i>The book has been out for quite some time and is still getting awesome reviews on Amazon:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I think this was a fellow by the name of Terrance; if you’re listening Terrance thank you for the review:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“This is a substantial work, more like a trilogy than a single title.” Actually, it’s three parts. Part I, well you guys know what it is.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“This next section is more meaty, the proof of the pudding is in the tasting. These are full text transcriptions from his inner source that Wilcock calls Ra. His Ra is nowhere near as oblique and cryptic as the early Ra presented in the Law of One from L/L Research. Wilcock studied the earlier Ra Material diligently and would often stare at a single page for half an hour trying to penetrate the full meaning.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><br /> In the second part we find a diverse collection of well-chosen passages, both snippets and five full chapters each devoted to an extended reading…” </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then, there’s another good one; this one I kind of like. “This presentation by Wynn Free just feels so right. It’s either a divine revelation or a preposterous though entertaining product of a wild and daring imagination...”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In any case, this is an introduction to Sources that say they’re group souls in other dimensions that are a helper and a guide for the evolution of this planet and humans.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I tell people, “You can’t believe that until you personally experience it.” We have three conference calls a week; we have an archive section. If they are who they say they are, this is kind of an epoch event. Except you have to decide; you have to develop the resonance. It doesn’t help for me or anyone else to say it. We just put out all this stuff for free so you can decide, so you have enough stuff to evaluate it. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">On our Wednesday call, people submit questions and we ask their questions live on the call. Terry is a—I don’t like to use the word ‘channel, even though that’s what some people would say. Terry is a ‘transmutation station’ in a physical body that is able to hear their words and put them into the English language. We ask them questions and you can listen live.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Channeling, this idea of bringing through messages from higher realms, particularly realms this high, is an imprecise science or exercise. There’s possibility for Terry’s own mind to bleed through; there’s even the possibility that a negative source could come in and say something to derail us. I don’t believe that has happened very much in our work, but that’s why it’s so important for you to use your own scrutiny.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The purpose of all this is not to make you a follower, even if they are who they say they are; it’s to empower you, for you to have a direct experience of your place in the Universe. You are actually at the center of the Universe where you are. Most of you don’t experience that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Now we’re talking to a Source that says they created the Universe and we have the opportunity to ask them questions. It’s not about the information – I won’t say ‘never’; even though we get a lot of wisdom and great answers, it is not the stimulation of your mental body that is the most important thing, because while you’re on this line, they say they are observing. They say they are connecting with you if you would like that experience. Many people have experienced an expansion of how they feel while they’re listening on this call.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It’s very subtle, but it’s not always subtle; it’s an individual thing. Pay attention carefully to the energy around you during the call; pay attention to shifts in your body. Remind yourself of how you were feeling when you came in to the call and how you feel when the call ends. Be a good observer and see if you can find this frequency that they say is them; they use this call as an excuse to make contact with you if you’re open to that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">On that note, we have an introduction, an introductory, I don’t know what to call it, calling in of the Light. That helps us bring the energies together and set the mood and the safety for them to come into the space.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Father-Mother God we ask for the presence of the Light to surround and protect Terry, myself and everyone listening or reading the transcripts, regardless of location and regardless of time, and that any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet earth, through our bodies and anchored into the center of the earth. Right now, we invoke a group energy connection, while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One to join with us, as we create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Do we have our Sources present to give an introduction to this session?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator. This is the 5<sup>th</sup> of December 2012 and we are connecting with the space of each and every person who wishes to be connected with who is on the call. We do not come through the radio; we do not come through the computer; we do not come through the telephone line; we are non-linearly present in this space. We are connected with Terry, who is bringing through the messages.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An is the name that we have given ourselves which is a combination of entities--individuals from the Ra group and from the Elohim group. We have the translation section of the Elohim group, which helps to provide the call in English since we do not speak English.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes we do. Our first question is from Ron in Mexico. He has a question about what’s commonly known as the higher self and how to communicate and receive guidance from our higher self.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Before I ask Ron’s question, could you explain to us from your point of view what a higher self is?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The higher self of each individual—and each individual has a higher self—each soul has a series of frequencies wherein they are guided; they get guidance. It is the highest and the best of each individual. It can be drawn upon to give guidance. An individual is a composite being and in other religions such as the Hawaii religion of Kahuna, there are references to the lower self. The higher self is of the higher frequencies and provides guidance for the lower self if the lower self can open itself up to be connected with the higher self being, can listen to the wisdom with which the higher self can guide one.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When you’re communicating through Terry, are you communicating through her higher self?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We are; it is her higher self and her lower self; her whole self is connected with us. We act like a docking area around the crown of her head. We stabilize ourselves with her at that point. It is all of Terry that is resonating with our energies.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What is the connection between the higher self and what’s called the soul?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The soul and the higher self are resonating; the higher self is the being that is the guiding force for the entity and for the soul. The higher self and the soul are synonymous with the description of the individual guidance unit of the being.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When an individual is making connection to higher frequencies, oftentimes you describe you yourself as a frequency that we can pick up. Is the higher self the first entry-point for those frequencies and then it gets transmuted in a way that a person can feel them or can speak with your projections?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No; we are resonating with the whole of individual; the higher self, the lower self, we are resonating with the whole. It is the whole that picks us up.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So the terminology of higher self and soul are kind of limited in a certain way, as perhaps part of the whole, yes?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is a guiding part of the whole, if the lower self opens itself up to resonate with the whole.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In what density is what’s called the higher self? Would that be different for every person?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is in the highest within; it is above the astral. It is connected in a point; we are getting out of locations when we describe where it is, as it is not so much in a location as it is the generator of a location.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And, does every human being have the potential to connect with their higher self?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Give us a moment. The majority do have the connection capability.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. So now I’m going to ask Ron’s questions here:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“Is it useful to visualize having a higher self when meditating and looking inward for guidance?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We see that this is a question that predisposes that the person is centered in their lower self. If this is the case, the answer is: they can visualize this.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If a person is acting as Terry is acting, the higher self is the guiding factor. It is not necessary to visualize this, as she is being her higher self and the lower self is being the higher self. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When you speak of visualizing the higher self, this perhaps is the more general condition of most earth beings and the answer is, “Yes, it helps to visualize.” However, when one can get to the state of everything acting in harmony, the lower self and the higher self is all one. It is not needed that one visualize it, because one is being it.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">A next question is from Robert…<span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span>We know that when we’ve talked to the Elohim they have said that they communicate using mathematics. They think in terms of mathematics; they look at the Universe as a mathematical construct and the way everything interacts relates to mathematics, which some people refer to as sacred geometry.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Robert’s question is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“Do angels really communicate with people using numbers?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Angels are from the angelic realm[and] are more in-tune with vibration and frequency and receive that as communication rather than communicating in words. They are able to interpret a person’s feelings with them, between them and the person and really sense the communication, not in terms of words, but in terms of essence derived from the total output of the individual which has more information than merely emotion that has tone and frequency and soul communication that is not dependent upon merely words.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This is a question from Cindy. The question has to do with certain people who are dedicated to disclosing facts about UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, classified, advanced energy and propulsion systems, sometimes connecting with Orions, because they believe the technological info comes from that group. We have learned—it’s in the Carla Rueckert material—that the Orion group is generally service-to-self oriented.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If somebody is holding a conference or a meeting that has this as it’s banner to bring this information available, these potential advances in technology available that come from extraterrestrial groups, “if one is on a spiritual path, would it be positive to attend this kind of conference, or might you pick up energies there that could throw you off?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

It could help expand the knowledge of what is out there within the lower densities. It would not be necessarily spiritual, but it could help to expand a person’s awareness. They indeed might pick up some negative orientations, depending upon the nature of the material presented at the conference.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“Right now there are many people complaining or commenting about hearing high frequency harmonics in their ears, to which I seem to be one of those who have heard those harmonic frequencies constantly in my ears for eight months.” </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This is from Joe in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. “They never go away and they are not the ringing in one’s ears that most people will hear every now and then. The common ringing in your ear type doesn’t last for more than a few seconds to a few minutes. The others are constantly there.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“So, could you explain what these tones are?”</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ringing in the ears can stem from a number of causes. One of them would be the ringing of the earth, as the earth is moving to change it’s orientation in a localized area. These are generally heard within the ears at a duration of a few seconds and the tones are connected with the location on the earth plane, wherein the earth is shifting its harmonics; dolphins can pick up these sounds very easily.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Another cause of ringing in the ears is a misalignment within the ears, in the workings of the ear, which can be connected with a misalignment within the kidney area and it is needed to clear the kidneys to help the body; to help the ear clear the area that is misaligned which is creating ringing. This is generally called tinnitus.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Give us a moment; there are other causes of ringing and vibrations in the ears which can be hearing the hum of the earth, which is not a misalignment but is an electrical phenomenon that sometimes an individual can pick up and hear. It is of an electrical nature and it is the hum that continues and goes on and on. We would suggest that you observe and see if this is the type of a hum that you are hearing that goes on and on and is the natural humming of the earth. It is a frequency which some people can hear and the majority of people cannot, even though it is going on in everyone’s vicinity.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">That is our answer.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This is from Wilbert in Brooklyn, New York. I’ll ask his question as a general question, because I think it might relate to many people. The question is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“Can someone have negative energies around them which come, not from within their own consciousness, but are projected from somewhere else? Can someone have negative energies around them which block them from fully realizing their higher connections?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The answer is yes they can, if there is an overpowering energy being focused in the area, if there’s an overpowering local consensus, that they are living in much like a fog around their area. We only say the word ‘fog’ as an analogy; there may be pollution of the thought-forms.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">For instance, if an individual lived in an area where the people surrounding them were looking in their life to lower-level things like drugs and gang activity, even though it may be a few miles away, they may be distorting the clearness of the individual and the individual may be having trouble breaking through. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Also, with the chemtrails, some of the chemicals put into the atmosphere, it tends to block the energies of individuals from free-range search and connection. If an individual was not so blocked, they would not be limited in the frequencies that they could search for and connect to. Much like a radio is limited to the frequencies that it can connect to, some individuals are limited by their surroundings, the thoughts of their neighbors and the chemical compositions of the things in the atmosphere around them.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is a specialized thing to include the projections of ETs, where the ET would need to be really focused upon the individual.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes; it is possible in that if someone is placing the curse on someone else it can limit the person’s ability to make all the connections that person needs to make to have a full and adequate life. For instance, if the curse was that the person would develop trouble walking, then, if not realizing that this is not their own making, they may fall subject to it.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">David from Grove City, Pennsylvania has a question about THC. THC is a very concentrated derivative of marijuana. It’s the active ingredient in marijuana that causes a psychedelic effect. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The question is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“Does the effect of THC in the brain put a person into a better connection with their higher self?”</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">What this can do: it is possible that it could lower the volume of interference from one’s lower self and help increase the connection with the higher self. This is one of the reasons that an individual can be addicted to substances in that it dulls the senses and the connection of some of the lower self, where the lower self has become out of harmonic resonance with the rest of the self. This is not a long-term answer.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is very possible that they may then open up to the entry of other beings to take over their space and to make things much worse.</span></p>

Does the answer work for all of those substances as well?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

These are very different substance working in very different ways and open an individual up to potential disaster. We give one such example of a young man who took a potent chemical cocktail one afternoon on a Sunday and left his body and became so scared he did not know how to proceed. The body died and the individual remained in a frozen state of paralysis, not knowing how to proceed until he had help from outside that could re-orient him to his situation.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“For many years, I’ve been aware of the veil separating this density from others and can almost touch it. In unguarded moments, I feel as if I penetrate the veil only to pull back like someone jerking their hand away from the heat. This is accompanied by a brief sense of fear.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">My question is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“Am I actually touching another density? If so, what is causing this fear? I don’t sense anything negative on the other side of this veil. Thank you. Dan.”</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Training is needed to penetrate the veil and to operate through the veil and to still maintain your own sovereignty and your own center. There is a fear of loss of control that one, when they move through the veil, would be operating with different skills, different ways, than one operates with the body. It is a giant unknown for one that is not used to transcending the veil and how to operate on the other side.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We suggest getting more information before attempting to go completely to the other side of the veil.</span></p>

Where would you find that information?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There is a philosopher; read about the subject. We suggest some of the work of Swedenberg. One of the things that you can do is to research the subject on the internet, to find all manner of information. Sort out that which resonates with you and eliminate anything that does not resonate with you. [Check out the Monroe Institute.]</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Next question is from Gary Brownlee in Redondo Beach. His question has to do with December 21<sup>st</sup>, 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Many, many people are saying what’s going to happen. We have asked this kind of question before, but as we move closer to December 21<sup>st</sup> I think it’s good to ask it again. Gary’s question is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“There is a concept that December 22<sup>nd</sup> will be the first day of the birth of a new level of humanity and its evolution. Would our Sources comment on that?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There is some truth to that, based upon the fact that as, we include ourselves, we are in the third density as we speak, the third density moves into higher frequency. As such it changes the nature and resonates the manifest realm, this resonance then, at a greater, higher frequency than before, affects all that is and shakes loose many of the stucknesses that a person and people have been holding in place, to make them more spontaneous.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Also, since the individuals have some knowledge of some of the things that are not consistent within their life, it brings these inconsistencies into focus and forces a person to either deal with them or act them out. It forces them to confront these things, so that they can, in many cases, be done with them and can move into a higher resonance that will be surrounding everyone.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Is this happening right now, already? Has it been happening as we approach that? Or is there going to be some dramatic turn-around on those dates?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It has been happening as we increase in frequency as day-by-day goes by; but on the 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> it is past a certain limit, so that there is more smoothness in the frequency, as when the frequencies increase some of the frequencies are more harsher and it smoothes out after the 21<sup>st</sup>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There have been other people that say that there is going to be a division on this planet of those people that are tuning into the higher frequencies and those who are not, and they will kind of separate themselves. Gary’s question talked about “the birth of a new level of humanity.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Would it be more accurate to say “a new level of potential for each person”?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The ones that ride through and are able to deal with it will move into a new understanding. The ones that cannot negotiate it will drop out and there already have been individuals dropping out. There has been an increase in suicides and there has been an increase in people being admitted to insane asylums as people struggle to find a way to deal with this.</span></p>
