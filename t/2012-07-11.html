This is a call; we’re getting our format together. Some of you—if you were on last Wednesday’s call, it was a bit like, crazy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m learning how to do this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

But, I do get the idea that we’re doing something really extraordinary in this realm. I know many people who are checking this out, are looking at this, have their own belief patterns. They may be religious.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

If we’re really talking to the Elohim on a public conference call and they’re answering our questions, I say this is a pretty epoch event.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">Sometimes people get on the call and they say “Wynn, why don’t you just shut up and let them talk to us?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Why do you talk so much?” One of the things I’ve learned is that part of my job is to create a group energy. You’re not supposed to believe they’re the Elohim because they say they’re the Elohim; you’re not supposed to believe that. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">You’re supposed to get into it because of the quality of the answers they give, the wisdom in the answers, and the energies which some of you can feel when we do these calls. Put them into your own discernment machine, so to speak, and say “Maybe they’re who they say they are.” Then, it’s not even that easy because every time we do it a call, you have to do it again. Is that the same Source or are we getting a new Source?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">They say if you look at the quality of their communication, it’s my experience that they have no agenda other than to send us positive, loving energies. They don’t want to say “Follow”; they don’t want to make you afraid. They have huge resources to bring information about things that a human could never figure out and when that information comes in, you have to see if it resonates. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">You have to do it over time; it’s not a quick thing to say “Okay, that’s the Elohim.” One of the real dangers of quickly saying “That’s the Elohim and Ra” is that you’re going to give up your power; you’re going to think “They know everything; I know nothing; tell me what to do.” That is exactly not what they would wish to happen, because ultimately this connection is meant to be empowering.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">Sometimes it takes a while to get that empowering energy back at you. The reason is because almost everyone in this realm comes to the table with a bunch of baggage. It’s hard to feel empowered with all that baggage. The first step is learning how to release your baggage, to let it go. It’s actually not something you can do with your mind; you can’t just say “Okay, I let go” because it won’t release that way. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">There are different processes of letting it go. One of the first steps is to identify it; to notice it, to say “Now I see what my baggage is”; because when you start observing something, the part of you that is observing it is separating already from the baggage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You’re starting to build part of yourself that’s looking at the baggage, because prior to that you thought you were the baggage; I thought I was the baggage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">Getting rid of your baggage is the first major step to empowering yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One of the reasons people hold on to their baggage is that when you let go of it, there is this fear that you’re going to be empty. You keep the baggage around you because it fills up the space. To get into the energy of these higher Sources, you have to start to empty yourself, so they can flow into you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">When I say ‘flow into you’, again it sounds like something is taking you over, so it’s not the best way to say it, so that you can experience the communion with them and feel the energy of them as part of yourself. One of the subtleties of this is that the Elohim, the Ra group, the Universe, is all one energy. When you make the connection, it’s not like something separate comes in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">It’s kind of like you suddenly feel expanded; then, when you feel that sense of expansion, historically sometimes, people have called that ‘initiation.’ You suddenly have felt yourself in a space where you’re bigger than you were before. When you feel that, then you know you have somewhere to go; it’s like the first step. It’s not the end step; it’s the first step, recognizing that there are positive energies that you can expand into that feel really good.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">It’s a process that you have to do by yourself; it can’t be done for you. But, you can get support in doing it. Part of the reason we’re doing these calls on such a regular basis, is because it gives you an opportunity to feel that expansion and it gives you the opportunity to understand it on a conscious level. That’s very important, because it’s a new territory. As you expand it on a conscious level, you can have more and more of it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">I know some of you on this line are really advanced. Up until now, I’ve done my best to read all my emails and even respond to them. Hopefully, we’ll expand and reach enough people where I’m not going to be able to do that. I really like doing it, but I’m going to have to prioritize my time, so I do what is most important. I see there are a lot of things I could add to my website.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There’s at least one other book to write; at least. There’s getting a book published in the regular arena so more people can access this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">Right now, I’m so happy; it’s so wonderful. We have worked so hard to get to this place where people are actually noticing us. It was not easy. Basically, I thought other people would find it important. I knocked on many, many doors and people said “Thank you, no thank you.” I realized that the people who would find it important were all on the grass-roots level; who didn’t have agendas, who were—how can I say it?—totally free of any worrying about what other people think about them and power and influence. They were struggling to make heads and tails of what this dimensional shift is about.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">I would be certainly that way if I didn’t have these Sources. Now, we have this authoritative understanding of how things work. The thing that makes it so believable is when we start to cross-reference it with history, with the Mayans, Jesus, even the Old Testament. It has such a good point-to-point explanation of things but without any belief patterns. You don’t have to believe anything; this is in the moment and they’re explaining things in the moment. Yet, it all fits.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

That’s what I thought too, when I first started unfolding this; there’s a lot more to learn in connecting the dots. As you connect the dots, it gives you more confidence that maybe we are really talking to who they say they are. Maybe this is an extremely positive thing to be contributing, and maybe you have the opportunity to speed up your evolution as a result of this connection.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

The nature, the process of how we grow has always been a kind of mystery to me up until recently. What does it mean to grow? Does it mean to get new concepts in your head? Does it mean to go to college and get a degree? There is one method of growth, and all of us have participated in this one method, which is experience.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">We do things in our life; some things bring us pain and some things bring us joy. We make mistakes over and over again, and every time we do that, we’re growing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We start to see “Well, if I do it this way it happens this way” and then you don’t do it that way again; you pass on that the next time it comes up. So, that’s bringing discernment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

He had this great saying “The path of excess that leads to the palace of wisdom.” When I first discovered that saying it was probably 35 years ago. I was studying all kinds of spiritual things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Many of them were promoting asceticism. What is asceticism? It is denial, in other words, celibacy, poverty, simplicity. I tried it and it wasn’t working very well for me. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

When you’re wise, you develop more compassion for other people, because you understand what they’re going through instead of talking down to them from some high spiritual platform.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

Some of you are in the middle of carrying all this baggage around; that’s okay, not to judge yourself, not to try to speed the process. Some of you are angels who have come into this realm and are here to hold an uplifted energy.</span></p>

One thing about a wanderer, is that a wanderer who has come into this realm—some of us come in from another dimension—is going to get screwed up here, almost all the time; 90% of the time. Sometimes you go through lots of lifetimes being screwed up. </span></p>

By going through the negative stuff and coming out on the other end of it, it gives you much greater tools to be of service—much more wisdom, much more understanding and knowing a lot about how the negative works. It’s all okay; the big thing is acceptance.</span></p>

As you listen to me, you start to join and combine energies. When we start to do that, we create a safe haven for these sources to land their group energy. They’re not just a voice. They’re a group energy, and they say they’re landing. This is my word, using the word ‘landing’. They’re landing in our space. They’re landing in your space; they say that they are watching everyone on the line who is open to being watched and felt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When we create a group energy, a loving group energy, then, they have a safe space. And, we have a safe space, too.</span></p>

When there’s a loving space it bounces off and it can’t get in. The first thing to do is create a loving space and that creates the environment where the negative can’t penetrate. That creates the environment where we can trust our Sources more, because they might really be who they say they are.</span></p>

Don’t believe things they say because they say it; take it and integrate it and if you can make it work, it’s yours.

That’s one of the ways that I learned about the negative; she was negatively attacked.

Daphne is a blessing to have started it; it’s a blessing to have her back. The nature of the information as it comes through both women is different. It’s not like you could think of a single consciousness that was talking and saying it’s taking over a person and moving their lips. </span></p>

Then, they use the person’s personality constructs. For example, there have been quite a few times where I’d been asking Terry a question and they would say “I wish Daphne was here; Daphne has a better vocabulary.” They suggested “Why don’t you learn five words a day?” to Terry. Actually, Terry does have a good vocabulary; she was a librarian, she’s very intelligent. Daphne probably has a better vocabulary than Terry or myself. She’s gone to Ivy League schools; she’s really studious.</span></p>

Another interesting thing I’ve noticed is Daphne tended to be an aristocrat in past lives. She has an aristocratic way of expressing herself. Terry was probably more simple in many lifetimes. Probably she was an aristocrat; people end up being everything; but, just in the form of the consciousness this life. Her communications are more simple; Daphne’s are more aloof as if of an aristocrat. Terry’s are more ordinary, sometimes maybe more accessible, sometimes maybe less intimidating sometimes. Daphne sometimes can sound intimidating.</span></p>

We extend our presence to you if you wish to make contact with us, or wish to connect with us. We have a very high frequency, and we have joined into a group we call ‘Ra’An’, which is part of the Elohim and part of the Ra group. This gives us a greater bandwidth that allows us to become within the reach of more people, that more people can sense us.</span></p>

This brings in grounding energies, lower energies, energies of the earth, frequencies of a lower vibration, a beautiful vibration, that can be blended with our frequencies and can be a bridge for anyone, each of you, who is sensing our energy, or attempting to sense our energy, to climb on board and to begin to hear-see-feel-touch our vibration.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

People can open their heart under very good circumstances, when they know that they are loved, when they are giving and receiving love, when they are in an environment that is caring and nurturing. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">One can become the master of how far and when to open their heart, as even in some dangerous situations, it is the opening of the heart that can get one through that dangerous situation. It takes one being, not in the future and not in the past, but being in the present, in the now, to see how is best to respond in a particular manner when one is in the third density.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">When one has come into a circumstance that one can set themselves up an environment, a meditation area, a time of day when they can meditate, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>during that time they can connect with us, can connect with the masters, can connect with areas of love in the universe and can then feel free and safe within that area to open their heart and can get around them a circle of friends, even a small circle, who they can feel open and joyous with and they can let down their hair. They can, during that time, open their heart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

So, it is getting a mastery over the opening and closing of the heart chakra.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">There is an area from which one can look at things, where one is entirely beloved and entirely safe and that is a looking that beyond the transition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When a person dies and transitions, then if they keep in mind that this is just a new chapter in their life and that all of these danger things that happened in the third density—there is a higher realm, a higher level, where they are totally safe and totally keep their place in the universe. No matter what happens within the physical body, they have their place within the physical universe and are totally loved and safe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

A dream can be interpreted when—we are going to give you dream scenario, a dream scenario wherein one is very high up in the air. They are walking on a narrow ledge and they lose their balance and they fall into space. They are falling into space and expecting a crash landing. Then that, from the third density point of view, is a very harrowing experience. It is something that would cause one to contract and close down. But, from a higher realm experience, it is something that can cause a transition, but where one is still kept safe and warm in the loving arms of All That Is, and one still is loved and still has their place in the universe. It is not the end of everything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

That is not the end; it is something that continues afterwards. They are still okay in the overall theme and scheme of things.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

One of the key qualities or indication of an open heart is gratitude, if one can create circumstances of gratitude in their life that automatically supports an opening of the heart, in my opinion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">For example, everything is exchanged, tit for tat. I do this for you, you do this for me. I work six hours, I get this paycheck. Can you do little extra things on your job above and beyond the call of duty that create gratitude both ways? Can you find people—this is an easy one; everyone can find people that really need you—like in old age homes and rehabilitation homes? Those people are so grateful when someone comes to talk to them, to help them to write letters for them that show any caring. You don’t have to do that; that’s above and beyond the call of duty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

You have to be careful: gratitude and doing those things doesn’t mean wearing your heart on your sleeve and being a sucker. You have to be very observant to notice if the feeling of gratitude comes in. Because there are certain people, if you do above and beyond the call of duty; they just think they can take advantage of you. You have to learn to tell the difference.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

At first it felt like “What a chore, answering all these emails.” As I started to do it, I started to feel this joy of connection with everyone I was writing to. I felt like how saying hello to them personally and making a comment was so important. I didn’t feel like I was doing it out of obligation. People emailed me back and they were getting it. There was a sense of gratitude, and then I kept doing it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

I know that can’t continue. I know that’s not in my highest purposes to just sit and answer thousands of emails every day. Nonetheless, the energy of doing it was just wonderful and the energy that you all sent back to me has been wonderful.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">Find ways and means to create gratitude. It can be unexpected. It’s the unexpected, random acts of kindness; that little saying that is on all the bumper stickers: <i>Random Acts of Kindness</i>. It’s within gratitude that you start building points that starts going towards grace; gratitude and grace have the same root. Grace is where your energy moves up above, out of the third density world of cause-and-effect and allows things to happen for you in magical ways; but you have to build towards that.</span></p>

Suddenly, after she had put it in the light for a bit, the following week three people made bids on her house and she ended up selling it for more than she was asking. That is how the universe brings in miracles. They’re just waiting to happen for you; you are not excluded. You just have to do a little bit of ground-work to get yourself above the karmic cause-and-effect side of things.</span></p>

Each one has their own particular circumstances and their own particular gifts and their own particular way of offering services that they may be able to then pull in money from the result of giving their services. Each person’s circumstance is dependent upon their own ability to connect with others, because they will be pulling in money from connections with other people, so connections with other people, companies, individuals, can make a big difference.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

One can group themselves into a frame of mind of excitement at contributing in a certain area. Instead of sitting thinking “I have nothing, and there is no money for the electricity, what am I going to do?” They can set those thoughts aside as much they can and place themselves into the frame of mind of what can I deliver? How can I find someone, that my services will bring adequate monetary reward?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

Sometimes individuals have to go through very painful things with the house and the mortgage being under water and the mortgage company demanding payment or to leave the house. During that period, if that is going on, then the individual can connect with family and friends for support and can look to the possibility of, we won’t say refinance, because when a house is under water it is unlikely, unless they have certain companies working with them like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</span></p>

They have their place in the universe. It is hard to maintain that attitude when things are going wrong, as things like houses and money, they are like supports within one’s matrix. When one knows within their own mind that these things are available to lean on for support, life is easier. When they are not available, then it becomes very hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Some religions such as the Jewish religion provide housing for people, depending upon the amount of money that they are earning or not earning. There may be a waiting list. Veterans have opportunities that are provided by the Veterans’ Association. Government has some things that an individual can apply for.</span></p>

The book talked about ascension and talked about disappearing from this realm in a body. I’m just going to clarify that myself very quickly:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">&nbsp;</span></p>

What they said was, that leaving this realm in your body is not going to be available for many people. In order to have that experience, all your chakras, all of them, have to be open slightly more than half. There was something, I think they called it ‘astral ascension’. It had to do with your heart chakra being open. With just your heart chakra open, and assuming there are unbalances in your other chakras, that you would start shifting realms after you die. You would graduate the realm in exactly the same way, but you wouldn’t leave here in your body. You would die however you died; they have huge amounts of angelic beings in other realms to work with people after they die and help them heal some of the traumas and things in their bodies, but your heart has to be open just slightly more than half to get that. That’s the way it’s said.</span></p>

Be around people who care for you, even if you have to go to a hospice. The loving of the people around you really helps you keep your heart open.</span></p>

Sometimes information may bleed through from the conscious mind of the channel. It is possible that a negative Source may interfere. Apply your own discernment. Take only what resonates and discard the rest. An answer to a question is meant for the person asking the question and you have the privilege of listening in, because sometimes you can gain insights from the answer. However, even though the circumstances may be similar, do not merely assume the answer applies to you.</span></i></p>
