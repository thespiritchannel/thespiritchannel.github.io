font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Channeled and Edited by Terry Brown</span><br /><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Transcribed by Connie O'Brien</span><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; Good afternoon, good evening, where ever you are.&nbsp; This</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is Terry&nbsp; Brown introducing Wynn Free who is the host of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Monday night BBS internet radio call.&nbsp; He’s out rounding up the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people on the conference line.&nbsp; This is a simulcast.&nbsp; We have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people who are on a conference line and also people who are on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">BBS Radio.&nbsp; He is going to be with us in just a moment.&nbsp; We have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a number of callers on the conference line and then the people on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the BBS Radio line. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">My name is Terry Brown.&nbsp; I am the co-host of the show and at</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">times I do channeling, in fact, almost every time now.&nbsp; Wynn</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">chooses the topic that we’re going to talk about.&nbsp; I never know</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what the topic is beforehand.&nbsp; I could take a peek on the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">computer and see what he’s announced but normally I don’t do</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that because I want to not think about it beforehand because if I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">think about it, then I could agonize over it and I’d rather</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">just bring it in through the channeling and have it come in and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">just be impromptu answers from the Elohim/Ra Group.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">What we do is normally when I channel, the Elohim Group and the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Ra Group, come through.&nbsp; It’s a mixture of the two.&nbsp; It’s as</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">if they are on standby to see which one is the one that can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">answer the question the best.&nbsp; Sometimes the Elohim will turn it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">over to the Ra Group to provide an answer. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The Elohim Group is a very, very high energy and they are very,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">very hard to sense unless you’re tuned in, like a radio can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">tune into different frequencies.&nbsp; Unless you’re tuned into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">their frequency, it’s hard to sense their energy but once you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">know their frequency, then you can tune into it and you can sense</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">them. It’s a very delicate high level, high energy frequency</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that’s so loving and it is surrounding me or surrounding the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">person that’s looking toward it and the individual then can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sense it.&nbsp; If they don’t sense it they may be looking at a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">lower energy and trying to see it but it is still there at the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">very high frequency.&nbsp; If you ask, so you receive.&nbsp; So if you ask</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">then you can find it easier to bring in.&nbsp; Listening to the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">channelings can help you become familiar with the frequency.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Reading the book The Creator God Book which Daphne and I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">channeled (with Wynn asking questions) can provide the energy for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you to sense it.&nbsp; Also, the book, The Reincarnation of Edgar</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Cayce, Chapter 17 has a Ra energy with it.&nbsp; Some people have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">commented when they get the book and it’s on their nightstand,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they can feel the energy flowing through the book.&nbsp; Wynn are you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">back with your crew? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I thought I was going to sneak in.&nbsp; You’re getting so</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sharp. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">So welcome everybody.&nbsp; This is Monday, July 11th, (2011) – Wynn</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Free in Phoenix and Terry in Sedona.&nbsp; This is our Monday night</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">BBS call.&nbsp; Just for your awareness you know we do three</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">conference calls a week and each call has its own flavor to it. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">On our Monday call, normally I pick a topic, we talk about that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">topic, and then we question our sources on that topic.&nbsp; On our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Wednesday call normally - people send me questions and sometimes</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">even healing requests, then we question our sources concerning</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">your questions.&nbsp; Last (Wednesday) we didn’t do a normal show</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and I had a lot of comments about that.&nbsp; Our Sunday call, which I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">believe our most important call, it’s more designed to—you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have to experience this to get it—it’s designed to connect</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with the energies and to create planetary and personal healing,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and bring in these energies from the higher realms in a way that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you can experience them in your body, personally.&nbsp; It’s very</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">profound, and oftentimes people come to those calls and they have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">healings, they have transformations of attitudes, and it’s very</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">unique.&nbsp; I’ve never experienced anything like it (except) years</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">ago, I did experience something like that in a room.&nbsp; It wasn’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">on a call but I experienced a man who could sit in a room and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">talk and hold the energies and my body would shift.&nbsp; That was a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reference point for me; I said, “I wonder how he did that?” </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">He gave me the idea that could happen.&nbsp; That’s on our Sunday</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">call.&nbsp; We do planetary healings where we create a group energy,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and we create group intentions to send and shift around the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">planet. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I hope you’ll check our calls out, check all of them out.&nbsp; If</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you are new and you want a schedule, write this down:&nbsp; Go to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">www.conference. messageaday.net.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Let me introduce Terry.&nbsp; For those of you who have tuned into the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">calls regularly or read my book know that Terry is the person who</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">has been holding the energy of the channeling and the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">communication with our sources on these calls.&nbsp; She’s been very</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">dedicated and her intent is really, really pure.&nbsp; You couldn’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">do these calls just to be entertainment, because you could get a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">negative source.&nbsp; I said that oftentimes you’ll find that most</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people don’t do public channelings.&nbsp; It took me a long time to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have the confidence that no matter when we did it and how we did</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it that we would get a positive source. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The reason people get negative and positive sources is that when</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you do this kind of stuff and you get an attachment to the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">recognition or self-consciousness or wanting to please people or</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">wanting to make a lot of money…&nbsp; Not that you shouldn’t make</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a lot of money; one can make a lot of money and send some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">blessings to our work so that we do.&nbsp; The focus has to be higher</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">than the money.&nbsp; The focus has to be on service.&nbsp; When the focus</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is on money, your whole intent changes and it becomes</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">manipulative in a certain way.&nbsp; Anything that is less than 100%</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">leaves openings for negative sources.&nbsp; We’ve been doing this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">now for quite some time.&nbsp; I tell people, “Don’t even believe</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we’re positive – in fact, you shouldn’t believe we’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">positive.&nbsp; You should apply your own discernment and check it out</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">for yourself.”&nbsp; The people who are on the line regularly get</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">tired of hearing me say this, no matter how many times I say it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there’s a tendency for humans to give up their power and become</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">believers and let go of their scrutinizing ability and their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">intuitive abilities and not internalize this. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Our topic today is the planetary grids.&nbsp; Years ago I heard</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">somebody talk about the planetary grids and I used to hear people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">talk about sacred geometry and I didn’t understand it.&nbsp; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can’t really talk about something until I grasp it myself.&nbsp; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have to get it on a gut-level thing – it’s not just about</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">information.&nbsp; So I hope in this call that I could clarify this in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">such a way that you guys can get it on that gut level.&nbsp; It’s a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reality system that we’re all in whether we’re aware of it or</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’m going to just talk shortly about how I’ve come to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">understand the planetary grids and what they are.&nbsp; Then, we’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going to have a conversation with our sources and ask some really</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">great questions that I don’t know the answers to.&nbsp; We’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going to (both) discover things together on this line.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">You all have some familiarity with the fact that our body is an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy system.&nbsp; Our body has meridians – meridians and energy</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">flows and there’s a science called ‘acupuncture’ which</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">stimulates the meridians of the body to increase energy flow in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the body.&nbsp; When the body goes out of balance the energy flows in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the body stop working correctly.&nbsp; The energy flows in the body</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are all connected, I believe one of the words they started using</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is axiotonal lines.&nbsp; In other words, the body picks up flows of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy from the cosmos, from the solar system and more.&nbsp; So</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we’re always, to the best of our ability to flow energy,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">connected to the energy of the cosmos into our bodies.&nbsp; If we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were totally open, we would be cosmic beings walking around all</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the time.&nbsp; To some extent or another, we can all understand that.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;We can all understand that there are energies flowing in our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">bodies.&nbsp; There are energies flowing everywhere, and it’s all</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the same energy. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">As we’ve come to learn on these calls, the earth is also an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy system that is alive and it has flows in it.&nbsp; So, it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going to have flows inside of it and flows all around it.&nbsp; Just</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">like the body, those flows of energy get corrupted and screwed</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">up.&nbsp; On one hand, they get corrupted by the things men do on the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">earth.&nbsp; We’re part of the earth’s energy field.&nbsp; As our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energies extend outside of our body, we combine with the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">earth’s field – everything is connected.&nbsp; The earth connects</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with the planets; the planets connect with the galaxies.&nbsp; One of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the things I’ve read but haven’t validated, there are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">negative beings in other realms that attempt to control the grid</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">systems.&nbsp; The grid systems allow flow of things in and out of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">them.&nbsp; I have a feeling that what we’re doing on Sunday is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">(we’re) busting through some of those control things in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">grids.&nbsp; We’re bringing the energy in from above the grid</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">system, through the grid system and into the earth.&nbsp; We’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">helping to orchestrate that.&nbsp; I don’t see that, I just have the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">idea that’s so. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">These are questions we’re going to cover this evening.&nbsp; I think</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this is going to be a really enlightening conversation, because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it’ll help us do our work better.&nbsp; It’ll help you do your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">work better, because each of us is a cosmic being to some degree</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">or another.&nbsp; If you’re on this line regularly you are probably</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">learning more and more to be in that space for greater periods of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">time in your waking consciousness. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’m going to call in the light – this is our little</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">invocation for oneness.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the light to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">surround and protect each person on this line, and any negativity</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">be taken to the higher realms of light and transmuted for the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">highest good of all concerned.&nbsp; We see ourselves in the flow of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">galaxies, through our galaxy, through the planetary fields,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">through the field of the sun, through the field of the earth,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">through our bodies and into the center of the earth.&nbsp; Right now</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we invoke a group energy connection amongst all of us present</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">while honoring the sovereign integrity of each of our souls, and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we invite those sources that are positive, service-to-others,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">operating and honoring the Law of One, to join with us and we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">create a protected space that only the positive has access and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">anything not of that nature must leave now.&nbsp; Do we have a source</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">present?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; This is Ra’An and we greet you in the love</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">light of the One Infinite Creator.&nbsp; It is our joy to enter into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the third dimension and entity, and to connect with each and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">every individual that is listening or will read the transcripts</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">or will listen to an audio at any later time.&nbsp; Do you have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> We called a topic tonight – “Understanding the grid</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">system” and that there’s a bunch of energies around the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">planet that are termed ‘the grids.’&nbsp; I’d like to ask some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">questions about the grid system.&nbsp; Could you, first of all, share</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with us from your perspective – What is the grid system?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; In your system of math or pictures of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">earth, there are lines which are drawn – latitude and longitude</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">lines.&nbsp; These are not what we look at as the grid system.&nbsp; These</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are organized ways of looking at locations on your earth. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">However we look at the grid system as electrical potential in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">area of the atmosphere above the earth, and these electrical</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">potentials are along the location points of the magnetic north</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and the south pole and are lines of demarcation where the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">electrical potential flows into the – we have words that the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">individual channeling does not know – the magnetosphere, the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">lines of flow of electrons from north to south within the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">electrical grid in the sphere surrounding the earth.&nbsp; There are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">certain locations where they enter into the earth and then they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">flow in a direction that is moving from north to … give us a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">moment.&nbsp; The electrons flow into the earth and as the earth picks</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">up charged particles from the sun, and as it moves in the various</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">locations in relationship to the rest of the solar system, this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">grid system shifts up to some degree in location.&nbsp; It is a moving</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">flow; it is generally thought that everything is strict and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">stable.&nbsp; However, everything is created in the now over and over</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">again, and is the result of all of the energies coming together</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that keeps it in its certain position.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Continuing this, I just want to make</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sure that I understood.&nbsp; These grid energies – are the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">electrical, are they magnetic, or are they etheric, or a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">combination of all three?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; They are a combination of all three, as it starts with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the etheric and is put into place and the energy held into place</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">by the etheric.&nbsp; Then, the movement of the particles and energies</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">through the space creates the magnetic field.&nbsp; It is a creation</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in progress.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> You know there is a word that people have used called</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“nodes.”&nbsp; Is that an area of high amplitude; is that an area</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">where lines cross?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Is that an area where the lines what?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Is that an area of high amplitude, high strength of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy?&nbsp; Is it an area where grid lines criss-cross?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; It is an area of intersection of flow lines, and it is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not necessarily high amplitude, but can be low amplitude as it is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a resting point in the intersection of areas.&nbsp; As you view the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">earth there are certain intersections where the flow changes</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">direction.&nbsp; These would be called ‘node points’.&nbsp; There are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">points in between where the amplitude reaches out over the earth,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and it is these areas where the energies can get stronger; it is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">altered by the rotation of the earth, also.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; There’s a lot of negativity on earth.&nbsp; If there’s a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">war, if there’s people cutting down rain forests; if there are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">things (where) either humans are hostile to each other or where</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">humans are hostile and aggressive to the environment, does that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">impact the grid systems of the earth?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes, it impacts the grid systems as it can create</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">intense disruption in the flow of the electrons in and through</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the areas and the structure can get upset and can create a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">momentary disruption where the energies of creation and all of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the energies to do with the planetary rotation and the rotation</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of the solar system can fill in the area again and begin to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">create a new homeostasis in the area.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; When the grid systems gets screwed up because of things</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">happening on our planet, does that mean the flow of energy from</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the cosmos gets screwed up into our planet?&nbsp; Is the grid system</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the mechanism for the energy to flow through to get to the earth</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and to get to us?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> The energy, the localized energy, around an area of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">disruption often will disrupt the outgoing flow and the ingoing</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">flow and it can then be readjusted and overtaken by the flow of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energies incoming within the planetary system and the rotational</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">spin of the earth, which then will tend to repair and heal the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">holes and disruption in the energy that has been created.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Do they get healed or do they stay broken?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Pardon?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Do they get healed, does the energy get repaired over</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">time, or does it stay broken?&nbsp; What is actually the mechanism,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">i.e. If on a Sunday call we send light to a given area or through</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a different area are we participating in repairing the grid lines</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in that area?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; You definitely are assisting in repairing the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">gridlines, as when there is an area of disruption that has been</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">created by war and explosions then the surface of the earth has</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">been disrupted, the energies have been disrupted, the spirits</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that are protecting the areas have been disrupted and they will</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">be renewed and healed by the incoming energies in the attempt to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">repair.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you. With the grid system we have places like the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">pyramids, how do you say that place in South America – “Machu</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Picchu” – different places that people consider nexus points</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">or special points or sacred areas: are those places are still</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sacred, or is that just something that was in the past and the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy has shifted?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; There are energy patterns that are set up over the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">whole earth and in the past, ancient times, there has been the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">understanding of how the grid lines flow on the earth and there</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have been pyramids built all over the world that have been set to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">stabilize the grids, particularly in the time of Atlantis.&nbsp; They</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are built on nodes and amplitude points of the grid system and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are set to help and stabilize the grid systems and to keep the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy flowing consistently as an aid to the earth.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> So in the time of Atlantis, they understood the purpose of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the energy systems and they consciously used things to keep the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energies flowing in the grid system – yes?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Then did that continue over in ancient Egypt when the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Atlanteans came to Egypt.&nbsp; Were the pyramids part of that attempt</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to keep that grid system flowing?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; They are.&nbsp; They are part of that grid system.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Are they still important – the pyramids?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; They are still important and are still working to help</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">stabilize the grid system; however, there have been recent</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">earthquakes that have shifted the grid system and have placed the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy grids in slightly different points.&nbsp; There are some areas</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">where the pyramids are now covered with water and they are still</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">assisting.&nbsp; However, they have been somewhat damaged, and if one</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were to take the grid system from them and expand on the grid</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">system from now and move it over earth, fit it over earth, it has</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">shifted slightly.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Are there situations and circumstances in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">solar system where negative forces attempt to control the grid</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">system through portals?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; There are races that understand the grid system</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and have been using it to arrive and depart.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; In other words, they need these energies.&nbsp; These energies</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are like tracks for beings to come in and out of this realm –</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">yes?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Both positive and negative?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Like if there were no grid system, they couldn’t be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">having this, there would be no life probably.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Would you repeat that?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Is the grid system a pre-requisite to life on earth?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Life is everywhere as the all-that-is is one thing that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">has been broken down into different energies…</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Terry is getting muddled, so she needs to take her hands</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">off the microphone.&nbsp; We didn’t hear the answer to the last</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">question.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; This is Terry and I’ve totally gone out of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">channeling now and I don’t understand, what were we talking</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">about?&nbsp; Hold on let me get back into the channeling.&nbsp; Can you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">hear it now?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Now you’re clear – you had your finger on the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">microphone and you were getting muddled.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; From this standpoint we can barely hear you on this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">phone at this time; but, we were speaking of the grid system of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">earth.&nbsp; Do you have another question?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> The last question was:&nbsp; The grid system functions to flow</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy from higher – let me just pose this as a question.&nbsp; Is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the grid system’s function to be a bridge to bring energies</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">from higher realms into the earth plane?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> We look at your question as being sort of upside down. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The grid system is the result of the energies of all of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">forces that are brought to bear on the area of planet Earth.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So it’s created from the earth up rather than from the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">celestial realms down?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; It is created out of all that is, not up or down.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I’m not in Sedona right now holding the energy</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">for this, and I can tell it’s hard on Terry, this particular</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">topic.&nbsp; I think we’ll just not ask any more questions this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">evening and bring this session to a close.&nbsp; We’ll let our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sources say goodbye to us and if there is anything to say.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; It’s that the phone has not been working</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">well and it is very hard to hear what you say.&nbsp; We thank you for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this and we apologize for the technology drop here, and we send</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">love and light to each and every person on this line.&nbsp; Adonai.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; I thank Terry very much for being a trooper</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and we got through that.&nbsp; I hope we got to the information</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that’s important.&nbsp; I did have more questions and maybe we’ll</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">continue them at another time.&nbsp; Maybe Daphne will come in,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because one of the things that has come up consistently about</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Daphne is that she’s one of those people – we all affect the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">grids, all of us – but, she’s one of those people that in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">particular part of her function in this realm has been holding</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the grids together for the earth.&nbsp; It would be really interesting</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to see if I could get her on the line and we could question her</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">about this. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Just reminding you all we’re giving our book away The Creator</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Gods of the Physical Universe want to talk to You.&nbsp; Go to the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">website www.creatorgodbook.com.&nbsp; Please, if you haven’t read</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it, read it.&nbsp; If you’ve read it tell other people to go to that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">website.&nbsp; It’s a really good website it makes people intrigued.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;There’s a little video for people who go there there’s been</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a really high percentage of signups.&nbsp; So, get the book. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Eventually people will be invited to conference calls and other</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">materials so it’s a good way to introduce people to this work. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It’s a very important thing, because I’m putting this out but</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">when you introduce someone and it sticks, there’s a huge karmic</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reward for that happening.&nbsp; There’s a new flow of energy</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because you’ve changed the universe just because you sent an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">email out.&nbsp; It’s not easy to talk about this without people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">thinking you’re crazy, but everybody likes to read a free book.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;It’s a great way to share.&nbsp; Tell everybody: </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>www.creatorgodbook.com</strong>.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I thank everyone who is on the line tonight.&nbsp; I will see you all</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Wednesday.</span><br /><br /><br /></p>

This is not meant to replace seeing your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">doctor, dentist or any alternative practitioner. &nbsp;Some people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">get healings here, so you can be open to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
