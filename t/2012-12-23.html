This is <st1:date month="12" day="23" year="2012" w:st="on">December 23, 2012</st1:date>, one day before Christmas Eve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

This is what we call our Sunday grid healing. It’s an amazing experience where we can gather on a phone line and on the internet and have this invisible consciousness which we call the Elohim and the Ra groups join us. They say it is them and then they talk to us and create an experience of a huge group energy. If you’re listening for the first time today, just get your mind out of the way. It’s like getting on a flow, getting on a train and either you’re on the train or you’re watching the train go by. The way to get on the train is just to be neutral, stop thinking about it and go with the flow. You don’t have to do that. Sometimes for months people watch the train before they feel comfortable getting on it. It’s a consciousness train. It’s not a physical train. Everyone has a multi-dimensional consciousness. Most often we don’t access that and we hold our consciousness in a fixed position. We don’t even know we’re doing that and that fixed position feels like this is who we are. That’s an illusion but we’re so used to it that we don’t realize there’s other possibilities. You can’t expand who you are using your brain because your brain is inside that model of who you are. You can access larger parts of yourself by going into situations that are holding the energy of the larger part of yourself so something happens. It’s like magic. It’s not really magic but if you’re not used to it, it’s like magic because suddenly something shifts. Now everyone has had the experience of something shifting in them and expanding. You don’t have to come to these calls to have that experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

It expands for most people into the whole area that they can see. You experience that as a sense of expansion. That’s an example, except that’s not a train you can stay on unless you move to the top of a mountain and live there and even in that case, you’ll probably lose it because everything becomes contracted to your normal way of viewing things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Like if you live in a beautiful city, usually you first go there and you say, “Wow! What a great city,” after a while it kind of flattens out. So the key is, how do you move to this higher vantage point and be able to hold it. One of the things is to keep going somewhere that provokes that in you and it starts to internalize. Even when it internalizes you get to the place where the experience flattens out. It flattens out because there is nothing to compare it to. The way we know we’re in a certain experience is because we have a reference point of another experience to compare it to. In the comparison you say, “I’ve arrived somewhere.” Once you hold that new space where you’ve arrived to it flattens out. You know that you’re different than you were before. You can use your memory and go access it but you still feel the same. You don’t feel expanded or exalted. It’s okay because you can operate and do things you could not do before. You can be of much greater service to people than you were before because now you have the new responsibility of being a reference point for other people. Then you can see, “I am somewhere different because I can do this and other people are being touched and moved.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Now you’re a teacher. Maybe teacher is not the right word. You are an inspirer. You are holding the energy. When you are going through this place of comparing yourself from being at a lower place and a higher place, when you meet somebody who is holding the space of a more contracted consciousness you’ll move into their space and you’ll think you are losing it. Then you want to avoid people for a while so you don’t get pulled in and you anchor yourself. As you anchor yourself you’ll learn how to do that for other people. One of the things is to know how to enter into something and pull back. Enter in and pull back. That way you don’t get pulled into the contracted consciousness but you move into it and pull back so you leave a trail from where that consciousness is to the place you’re holding and the person then has the choice to follow that trail. That’s how you become a teacher. Not by the words you say. You can say the right words and help someone but it’s not the words. It’s leaving a trail into higher expansion without getting caught in a more contracted energy. So that’s what’s happening on these calls, we’re creating trails. It didn’t happen in one big fell swoop; it happened tiny bits at a time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

I started myself thinking, “I must be crazy. I must be missing something. This can’t be real.” When Daphne and I were living in a little apartment in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Pomona</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">California</st1:state></st1:place>… We didn’t come together to do this, we came together to play music. We were both musicians. She heard my songs and said, “Wow! You should be famous.” I heard her harp playing and I said, “Wow! You’re really phenomenal!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I have to go look and see how long it was after we first met each other that we had that now famous trip from <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">L.A.</st1:place></st1:city> to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Portland</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">Oregon</st1:state></st1:place> where I said, “Does anybody want to talk to me?” and she answered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Now I’m bringing it back to the comments I was making before we started recording and that piece you heard that opens up all of our talks is Daphne’s harp playing. That was Daphne’s harp playing today. I remember when we talked about it and we had sessions about it, they said her playing would incorporate Elohim frequencies. So it was a way that people could expand into a higher consciousness. Music does that in general. It bypasses the mind and helps people expand into the consciousness of where that music was created from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">If you listen to Daphne’s harp playing or any of her music, there is something phenomenal the way she puts melodies together because she’s always improvising. Let’s see if I can put this into words because there’s something about this that is similar to life. It’s something that can be expanded. She will start on a riff, a melody, and you think you know where she is going and just about the point where you think you can anticipate the note or the phrase that’s coming next, she changes it and it’s suddenly slightly different and it pulls you in because you say, “Where is she going to go next?” then it switches and changes so it keeps your attention glued to it. It pulls your conscious in and therein you suddenly find yourself in a new space. That is like life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">By the way, I’ll give Daphne a commercial here. If you go to www.store.intelligent-infinity.com I think I have Daphne’s album up there. There are about seven songs. You’ll notice there’s a back-up musician playing drums, sometimes he’s playing flute and the back up musician is David Wilcock. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">After Daphne and I had separated after our first time in Pomona, the first six months we were together, David had heard her harp playing (David was living at Carla Rueckert’s house) and he invited Daphne to come visit Carla Rueckert because he wanted to do a recording with her and that recording that is on Chiron Wind is David and Daphne. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

The idea of it is an incredible concept to apply to your life. Because when a rhythm gets established, it holds a space and you start living in the groove of that space and eventually there’s something more and you don’t want to let go of the rhythm that’s established and learning how to be in a rhythm and break out of a rhythm and be back in a new rhythm and break out of it puts you on a spiral of evolution. It keeps you in motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

We are over the viewpoint of Earth, looking at Earth, looking at the scenery, looking at the snow in places, looking at the warmth in other places and we impart Love Light, as this [earth] is a very beautiful contribution; these frequencies that these manifestations are operating at are a beautiful, rich resonance, that add to the storehouse, the treasures, of All That Is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

We do not come over the telephone line; we do not come over the radio; we do not come over the computer. We bypass all that and we are directly there. As you resonate to our frequencies, we resonate with your frequencies and we bring a purity of frequency, a purity of love, a purity of flow, where we unlock stucknesses. We unlock the locking-into paradigms that one wishes to change. We bring flow to that and we bring a little bit of an impetus that can grow, if one wishes, to unlock those stuck points and to begin to open them up, so one can flow. One can, as one expands the stuck points, see things that are involved in the stucknesses that are there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The negative is encroaching on the positive and is pushing on it and the positive is pushing back. There becomes a locked problem that the individual cannot move through. This can be coming from the outside in, from a government regulation, to something that the individual is trying to work past.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It could be someone in your neighborhood that is jealous and is trying, at a very low level, to obtain superiority and it becomes a problem. However, one can move past that stuck point and can include other frequencies, rather than narrowing oneself down to those frequencies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

It takes observation to see what it is that is precisely and actually going on, as there are different variations, even in the area of negative attack, to observe and to see what it is. Is it from outside? Is it from something that has opened oneself up to from a belief from the inside?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

If one can change the belief, then they open themselves up to moving out of that detrimental situation into another and they allow other beliefs, positive harmonious beliefs, to come in and to supersede the belief that is bringing a non-harmonious or detrimental manifestation into one’s life.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

If one is looking for a job, then communicating the things that you have to offer to someone out there to match yourself up with them could be the perfect opportunity for growth for finances and this moves into the area of relationships. If one is looking for a relationship, there is someone else out there that is looking for you. Open up to communicating that, so that someone out there can find you.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

After sitting in that, the person takes on that belief in a subconscious way, so that even if there is someone, other people, out there that are feeling friendly and are loving, then they don’t get the message, because in between that lovingness coming toward them is the message that they had gotten and set up as a manifestation in their life when they were a child. So they aren’t seeing what is happening, exactly, when the other person is being loving and then the individual might put a twist on it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

So one incorporates that into their view of the world and it needs to be observed and let go of little-by-little, so that the individual can again become open to love without that twist or that interpretation that had been put on by the parents in the parents’ huge effort to make the child perfect. No one is perfect, although one might strive for it—and then on another look, everyone <i>is</i> perfect, when you consider all the things that they are working through and are struggling to achieve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

So putting them on and giving them a visibility on our calls is giving us the opportunity to ask.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

The Ra group is who, we believe, spoke through Edgar Cayce, through Carla Rueckert, through David Wilcock. The Ra group is another group soul that is made up graduates of this realm. The voices you are hearing are not one entity, we believe, but it’s a manifestation of a group putting together those words coming through either Terry or Daphne and the Ra group is made up of graduates and that means they are souls, entities that came into the physical universe and had many, many lifetimes. In our work it is usually indicated that people have gone through 1000s of lifetimes and every time they have a lifetime, they forget everything and we get trapped here and we get stuck and we can’t get out. That’s why we keep coming back. A certain amount of beings do graduate this realm and they go on with their evolution and they explain that they have teamed together to create a group soul that is working on behalf of all of us that are trapped. They work more closely in than the Elohim. They work more in creating plans and how to create contributions to our planet that can lift people and the vibration here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

So the Ra group has a bit more wisdom about certain things than the Elohim; the ability to go into our consciousnesses and understand the feeling of being trapped, whereas the Elohim group does not have the experience of being trapped here. They learn things vicariously by watching; they can join with a consciousness here and I think they can feel the pain that someone is going through but they have never been trapped in the pain whereas the Ra group has. So it’s two different perspectives and we are as a group very blessed to get access in both of these sources in their assistance in helping us transcend our own compressions and our own hang ups and our own obstacles and our own belief patterns and to access those higher parts of ourselves that many of us have had huge challenges in accessing because we’ve been trapped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sometimes information may bleed through from the conscious mind of the channel. It is possible that a negative source may interfere. Apply your own discernment; take only what resonates and discard the rest. An answer to a question is meant for the person asking the question and you have the privilege of listening in because sometimes you can gain insights from the answer. However, even though the circumstances may be similar, do not merely assume the answer applies to you.</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #2a2a2a;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
