font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>INTRODUCTORY TEXT</strong></span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> This is Monday March 14, 2011; my name is Wynn Free.&nbsp; This</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">is our Monday night live telecast/ simulcast between our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">conference line and BBS Radio on the internet.&nbsp; My co-host is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Terry Brown – are you there, Terry? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; I’m here. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; You’re there, okay.&nbsp; For those of you that got our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">mailing, we’re going to have a whole discussion about</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earthquakes today.&nbsp; I’m quite sure we’re going to learn some</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">things that none of us ever knew.&nbsp; One of the things I’ll start</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">off with – I mentioned Edgar Cayce and the Edgar Cayce</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">readings, and some of you have been very influenced by Edgar</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Cayce and his readings.&nbsp; I’m one of those people who was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">influenced many years ago.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">In the Edgar Cayce readings it was said that there was going to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">be a huge earthquake and huge earth changes that were going to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">severely create havoc on this planet.&nbsp; It was talked about</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">California dropping into the sea; Japan going into the sea, New</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">York going into the sea and maybe parts of Europe disappearing in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the “twinkling of an eye.”&nbsp; When I was originally reading</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Edgar Cayce, I had a friend in Berkeley and she was, I guess, my</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">college – I hate to call her my college girlfriend, because she</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">played a huge part in my life at that time.&nbsp; She became a singer</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in my rock-and-roll band, and I learned about astrology and Edgar</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Cayce.&nbsp; It was my first introduction to metaphysical things</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">through her.&nbsp; We would be watching for the signs, like in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Edgar Cayce readings it said “these changes would not happen</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">until there was a volcanic eruption from Mount Etna, or Mount</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Vesuvius, in Europe.”&nbsp; We kept looking for signs, and once</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">every six months we would think “Oh, oh, this is going to be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the weekend of the big one”, and we left and went out of town</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">somewhere.&nbsp; Of course, it was never the weekend.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">There was an interesting thing – when I was originally reading</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Edgar Cayce, I was very attentive and I studied it quite a bit. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I remember Edgar Cayce’s readings would talk about solar</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">cycles, and I didn’t know what solar cycles were.&nbsp; I said, </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">“I should be able to figure this out.”&nbsp; I looked up “solar</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">cycles” and I could find nothing anywhere on solar cycles. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Here I am, many years later, and understanding a great deal more</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what Edgar Cayce meant by solar cycles.&nbsp; We talk about the end of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a 75,000 year cycle, and I couldn’t find anything on that 35</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">years ago.&nbsp; Today, it’s one of the things that is a prime</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">turning point, study point, not only by me but by many, many</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">people now who are using the Mayan Calendar 2012 date as the end</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of a cycle.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Edgar Cayce talked about the end of a cycle, and of course Carla</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Rueckert and David Wilcock both talk about the end of a cycle. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Most people refer to it as a 75,000 year cycle.&nbsp; It’s connected</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to not to planetary cycles; we know or at least we believe, or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it’s been pretty fairly repeated, that there is an energy that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">transmits from the center of the universe through the galaxies</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and it gets re-transmitted through the center of galaxy which is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">called the Hunab-Ku, which is the precursor to all physical</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">things, including our bodies, in different concentrations and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">frequencies.&nbsp; And, that energy moves through all the galaxies,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">all the planets, and through the energy fields of the earth</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">before it gets to us.&nbsp; It is in a state of shift and change,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">somehow in relationship to all the positioning of everything it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">has to go through to get here.&nbsp; That’s going through a huge</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">amount of distance to get here.&nbsp; If it’s coming from the center</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of the universe. and if it travels at the speed of light –</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">these are questions that we might ask tonight – if it travels</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">at the speed of light then the time it’s gong to take to get</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">here by the speed of light is a very long time.&nbsp; I have a feeling</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it travels faster than the speed of light; in fact, I have a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">feeling with this energy it just might be instantaneous, and so</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it violates all the rules of physics.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">In the Edgar Cayce readings, there were two distinct, separate</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">indicators of this period we’re in right now.&nbsp; I remember</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">reading both of them, and I remember asking myself, “Why are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there two distinct indicators?”&nbsp; One indicator was this long</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">reading about the earth changes of California going into the sea,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Europe going into the sea, this place disappearing in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">twinkling of an eye, etc. etc.&nbsp; The other reading was just a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">short reference to this period where it said these changes will</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">happen gradually.&nbsp; I asked myself, “How could they both be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">true?&nbsp; How could, at one place it says all these things are going</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to happen in a twinkling of an eye and another place – these</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">changes will happen gradually?”&nbsp; That puzzled me.&nbsp; Of course,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">at that time I never had an answer until I discovered David</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Wilcock.&nbsp; I began writing the book The Reincarnation of Edgar</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Cayce? and I started the study of Wilcock’s channelings.&nbsp; In one</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of his channelings, the Ra group, and of course the book that I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">wrote makes the case that the source that was speaking through</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Edgar Cayce was the Ra Group.&nbsp; It was a group soul composed of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">graduates of this realm, of billions of graduates, and acted as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">pure energy and worked with planets at lower levels of evolution</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">like ours and throughout our history made interventions here,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">talked to different beings in this realm just as they did through</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Edgar Cayce.&nbsp; In some cases, those beings might have been the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">prophets of the Old Testament, might have been Jesus and most</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">recently Carla Rueckert and then David Wilcock and then, of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">course, me.&nbsp; Because, both Terry and Daphne – when we first</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">started talking to the Elohim, mostly we were talking to the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Elohim but occasionally a voice came in that said “I am Ra”</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and they came in for certain specific reasons based on a question</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I was asking.&nbsp; Those of your who are regular listeners to our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">line know that the voice that talks to us on our conference calls</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">explains itself as a combination of the Ra group and the Elohim</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">group, and that both group souls have created an alliance or a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">cooperation to work with our group to answer questions.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The Elohim group, by and large, have not had bodies in this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">realm.&nbsp; Their information, even though it’s over billions of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">years, is derived through vicarious observation.&nbsp; Also, feeling</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">us,&nbsp; I believe they can feel us, they can occupy our space and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">feel us – but, nonetheless, I don’t think they’ve suffered.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;[whereas] The Ra group, the members of the Ra group, understand</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">suffering in this realm in a way that the Elohim group doesn’t</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">understand it.&nbsp; The Ra group, speaking through David Wilcock, did</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a whole transmission where they made a correction on that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">prophecy, the prophecy – the devastation prophecy – that came</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">through Cayce.&nbsp; In their correction, they said that wasn’t</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">them.&nbsp; They said “That came from a source that we would think</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of as negative.”&nbsp; They said that both Cayce and Wilcock, from</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">time to time, would connect with a negative source and they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">didn’t know it.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons why I say – those</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of you that are listening at any time – never take channeled</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">information and blindly believe it, because it’s just as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">possible I could have a negative source or anyone else.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">When I learned about this possibility of a negative source, I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">also learned how you could give up your power to a channeling and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that there had to be something more to it than prophecy and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">information.&nbsp; I decided that I could trust the loving energy that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I could feel from these sources more than any information that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they said.&nbsp; But then I would have to integrate the information,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and cross-reference it, and if it went through enough tests I’d</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">say, “It’s probably true.”&nbsp; So that’s why I always tell</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you to put all that we do here through your own tests and some of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you can feel the energy.&nbsp; Some of you, the information wakes up</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">cellular resonances; nonetheless, we’re not bringing forth a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">truth that you should be sure is correct.&nbsp; That’s a caveat.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I went back and looked at this Cayce channeling, the devastation</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">channeling, and in most cases Cayce’s channelings did not have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a by-line.&nbsp; A by-line means they didn’t say where they were</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">from.&nbsp; Cayce called it his source and sometimes he said it was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the Christ talking through him.&nbsp; In this particular channeling</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the source had a by-line, and I think the name was Hilaleah –</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I’m not going to say that name again because I don’t want to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">invoke that source on this call.&nbsp; I did a lot of research.&nbsp; I had</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the Edgar Cayce CD-ROM, and I did a search on that name and I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">found other places where he came up.&nbsp; Like: there was one place</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">where it said, “I am in the heavens as Jesus was to your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">realm.”&nbsp; There were other places where Edgar Cayce had a group</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of people around him who were monitoring these channelings.&nbsp; He</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">was unconscious; he didn’t know what he was saying, so they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">would evaluate and make recommendations.&nbsp; They decided, at some</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">point, they didn’t trust this source.&nbsp; They recommended that he</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">didn’t bring it through anymore, and from that point on he</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">didn’t, but in the history of Edgar Cayce’s channelings this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">particular distinction was never made.&nbsp; People quote that source</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">over and over again, acting as if it was as accurate as all of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Cayce’s other readings.&nbsp; I don’t think it was.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">What would a negative source have to gain by coming in and making</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a reading like that?&nbsp; What would the negative have to gain?&nbsp; Of course,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">when we talk abut the negative, it sounds like all the negative</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">is in one little place and you can just point to it and say “bad” and it’s </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">not that way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">It’s far, far more complicated.&nbsp; The negative is a whole subset of the </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">universe.&nbsp; In Carla Rueckert’s readings, in her Ra readings, Ra said </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that the negative was very pleased to work with anyone in this realm and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">if you happened to have a service to self disposition, and you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">called on them they would work with you, encouraging and helping</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">your service to self disposition.&nbsp; In other words, you could</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">create invocations and they would create a group energy to help</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the negative invocation.&nbsp; So somebody like Hitler who was very</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">occult-oriented, was very likely connecting to negative sources.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Then Carla Rueckert said in her channelings that if somebody was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">positively disposed and was service-to-others there would still</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">be attempts by negative sources to connect with that person.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">way they would connect would be acting positive and giving the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">person things that seemed valuable to them, like prophetic</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">information.&nbsp; The negative can do prophecies, just as well, if</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">not better, than the positive.&nbsp; They were trying to get attention</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">pointed towards them.&nbsp; One way of getting attention is creating a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">certain kind of credibility through prophecies, which both the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">positive and the negative use.&nbsp; In other words, Jesus was a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">fulfillment of many prophecies of the Old Testament.&nbsp; David</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Wilcock was a fulfillment of a prophecy through Edgar Cayce,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">where it was said he would return in 1998, live in Virginia Beach</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and may be the liberator of the world.&nbsp; So in my analysis of it,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they were attempting to create an anticipation, and that they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">were hoping that they would be able to fulfill the prophecy.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">When I say hoping, because all of this is free will, when they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">asked David to go to Virginia Beach, they couldn’t be sure he</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">would go.&nbsp; If he didn’t go, the buck stopped there.&nbsp; But, he</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">did go and that’s when he learned he looked like Edgar Cayce</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and that’s when he learned about this prophecy.&nbsp; This is how</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they made him know who he was. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Why would a negative source want to create a prophecy like that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">through Edgar Cayce?&nbsp; Two reasons as I see it – one reason is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to discredit Edgar Cayce.&nbsp; Since Edgar Cayce was, according to my</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">understanding, a representative of the Ra Group, that they would</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">want to find ways for people to turn their back on Edgar Cayce. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">In fact, I believe they said that devastation was going to happen</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">somewhere around the year 2000.&nbsp; Of course, it didn’t happen. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">You can still go on the internet and find people discrediting</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Edgar Cayce because of this prophecy that never happened.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The other reason for a prophecy like that could be – we’ll</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ask this – to create fear, to create anticipation, just as when</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I was in college, and we would have this background vibration of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">anticipation, that we would leave Berkeley every so often to get</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">away from this devastation.&nbsp; Perhaps a third reason to do it, is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">by stating it and perhaps if enough people thought of it and were</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">anxious about it, you might actually bring it around.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">As we listen to the answers tonight, we’re all going to be also</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">testing our own sources with our own intuitions.&nbsp; And, if I ever</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">feel there’s something totally off, if I’m sure of it, I’ll</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">send an e-mail off the next day and say “I think we should all</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">disregard that.”&nbsp; Terry is very highly intended and thus far, I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">haven’t ever found a reason to challenge the kind of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">information that was coming through.&nbsp; I’m still going to be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">neutral and open-minded as we ask these questions.&nbsp; We’re not</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">here to give up our power to information; we’re here to be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">co-creators with each other and with Source, positive source. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">That is really the best positive outcome of attending these calls</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and paying attention to this material, as I see it.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Prophecies which talk about earthquakes and inundations create</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">very easily – fear.&nbsp; Some of us who have been on these calls</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have gone a long way in overcoming fear, because when you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">actually take the perspective that this is one life in many,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we’ve all had thousands of lifetimes and although this period</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">is very special in many ways, we may have gone through this kind</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of period in the past, in the past epochs.&nbsp; I think once one</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">becomes neutral, then one overcomes the fear of dying which is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">probably a major anxiety in this realm.&nbsp; Of course, if you’ve</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">made connection with our sources energetically I have this idea,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">which I can’t prove but I think it might be true, that when you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">do die – if you’ve made these energetic connections they will</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">be there once your body is gone.&nbsp; On those notes, I’m going to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">call in the light, and we’re going to ask some questions about</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earthquakes.&nbsp; We have about 23 minutes. Let’s find out why we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have earthquakes. </span><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">WYNN CALLS IN THE LIGHT:&nbsp; Father/Mother God, we ask for the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">presence of the light to surround and protect Terry and myself</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and each person on this line and each person on the replay line</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and any negativity be taken to the higher realms of light and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">transmuted for the highest good of all concerned.&nbsp; We see</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">universe through the center of the galaxy, through all the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">planetary fields, through the earth field, through our bodies and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">grounded into the center of the earth and right now we invoke a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">group connection, a blending of energies while maintaining the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sovereign integrity of our souls and we invite those sources that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">are positive, service to others, operating in the Law of One&nbsp; to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">join with us and we create a protected space that only the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">now.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">We wait for the presence of our sources to identify themselves so</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we can ask questions about the selected topic for this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">evening’s call.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Creator.&nbsp; This is March 14th 2011, transmitting through Terry</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Brown and with Wynn Free in Sedona, Arizona and connecting with</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">each and every person who is on the BBS Radio listening and on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the conference line listening or any one who will listen later to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the replays or will read any transcripts of this.&nbsp; Transcripts</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">are generally put out and sent through the Spirit Channel.&nbsp; We</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">are available and we are here.&nbsp; This is Ra’an.&nbsp; We understand</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">your intense interest in the area of earthquakes as we see that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">an intense earthquake has affected your sphere within the last</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">week.&nbsp; (The earthquake in Japan and resultant tsunami.) Do you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Number one – we know earthquakes start because of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what’s called “tectonic plates”, and that somehow the crust</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of the earth has ruptures in it and there are times when these</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ruptures separate.&nbsp; When they do, it creates what we call an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earthquake.&nbsp; Can you explain why the earth has ruptures? Probably</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there are geologists that know the answer to this, but I’d like</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the answer from our celestial point of view.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Much as if you would take a sheet of say plastic</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">material, and you would torque it and bend it beyond its tensile</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">strength, then it would rupture.&nbsp; It is the same with earth, as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the earth is round – it is a sphere.&nbsp; At times the sheath of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the earth is torqued or bent in an area or way that it cannot</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">adjust to without breaking.&nbsp; It is a matter of simple physical</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">forces that creates pressure points upon any one given area and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">when the pressure is too much in one direction over another it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ruptures.&nbsp; Then the earth, the rock, the matter on the other side</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">seeks to stabilize, and also ruptures.&nbsp; As you may note, when</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there’s a big earthquake, then the area around that earthquake</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">creates misadjustments, misalignments which then create an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earthquake in another area, perhaps at a certain level (or depth)</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">due to the three-dimensional (aspect), in that there is depth</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">involved, and the depth of the earth moves to readjust itself to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the new position.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">As one moves into the alignment with the Hunab-ku, extra forces</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">are brought to bear upon the solar bodies; all solar bodies</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">within the solar system, and upon earth.&nbsp; These create a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">movement, as does the (influence of the) moon, in the crust</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">wherein the earth, in a certain area, may be attracted and move</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">towards the moon and create tides.&nbsp; Then the water would swell</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">further and be affected by the gravitation of the moon being</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">closer.&nbsp; Water has a terrific weight in certain areas, as in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">San Francisco Bay; so that when the tide comes in and is, say a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">very high tide, it creates a significant pressure and weight upon</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the ground underneath.&nbsp; The earth then responds accordingly and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">where there are weak points, it adjusts and you experience</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earthquakes.&nbsp; There are weak points within the structure at the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">interface of the tectonic plates as under and near Japan, and as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">near the Pacific coast off of Oregon and Washington and Canada. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">There is significant slippage possible within these areas, as the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">weights of water change and as the pull of the magnetic forces of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the moon have the pull of the alignment, being in alignment with</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the center of the Hunab-ku.&nbsp; If one would examine it, (it) would</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">be significant mass.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">When earth comes in alignment with the Hunab-ku, significant mass</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">then would be pulling and affecting earth at that time because of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the star matter, the amount of matter that comes into alignment</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">with earth at that time, as the spoke of the galaxy, the flat</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">part, is directly between earth and the Hunab-ku which creates</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">significantly more gravity upon earth at that time.&nbsp; Therefore,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there are more ruptures at a time like this.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn</strong>:&nbsp; Are there more ruptures at a full moon than a non-full</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">moon?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Repeat that.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Is there any connection between the phases of the moon and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the potential for earthquakes on this planet?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> There is definitely an influence of the phases of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">moon, and particularly the distance of the moon from earth, as a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">full moon gives more of a pull, and you may notice a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">de-stabilization of human behavior during the full moon and even</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">jokes are made about it.&nbsp; There is, as you’ve learned in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">history, more of a connection between large earthquakes and the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">full moon.&nbsp; The distance from earth of the moon also makes a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">difference.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Are any other planets very strongly involved in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">potentials for earthquakes or planetary aspects or positions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; All planets are affected by these factors.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; It’s been indicated to us that when we do our grid</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">healings, that when we bring energy into a tectonic plate that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">has the potential for an earth rupture, we are doing something</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">positive that could either cause this to not occur, or limit it,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">or move it to another location.&nbsp; Could you explain the process of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">how the energy that moves through the cosmos and the energy that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we create, impacts the potentials for earthquakes?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; All things are created, and there is a higher</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">place where “one is all and all is one”; where one may then</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">may affect the creation at the creation point of specific</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">individual things, and can then change the outcome, change the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">pictures, the manifestations, as in that point there is control</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">over all.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it have been possible, if there were</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">enough people on the planet or enough people with a strong</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ability to project energy, would it have been possible to stop or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">reduce that quake in Japan, or was it something that was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">inevitable?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> It is always possible to change things.&nbsp; As they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">approach in time, they become more and more manifest in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">physical realm.&nbsp; As they approach in time, the manifestation, or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">their pre-manifestation symptoms - we think in mathematics and in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">potentials, through calculus curves where the potential for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">manifestation increases, and the potential to change them</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">decreases.&nbsp; As an event nears then it becomes harder to change,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and in the sub-logos, we arrange the manifestations within the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">realm, take in the data and begin mathematically to put it into</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">manifestation to the point where at a specific time then the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">manifestation occurs and as the time towards the event happens,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it becomes less and less likely to change it, as the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">manifestations work itself more into the underlying substrata of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">all that is.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; In the situation of Edgar Cayce, we discussed</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a prediction of what Ra spoke as a negative source through David</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Wilcock.&nbsp; Could you share why a negative source would want to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">make this kind of prediction?&nbsp; I know I gave my reasons, but can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you share it from your perspective?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> The negative source may be negative because they are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">reading a so-called TVs - the trailers, the tracks, the remnants</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of what things are build up of, and they are seeing the presence</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and are jumping to conclusions.&nbsp; They may be an upstart who is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">wishing to have control or to simulate some kinds of control over</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">future events in the prediction of them and they may not be well</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">versed in the details and have jumped the gun and misread the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">situation and peeked in different events in the future and put</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">them all into one event.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn</strong>:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Could you share – and you can pass on this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">if you would choose to – are there places where there is a high</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">probability within the next near future of having major</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earthquakes on our planet and perhaps share this so that when we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">do our grid healings we can be sure and include these locations.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An</strong>:&nbsp; There are.&nbsp; Pay particular attention to Chile, pay</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">particular attention to Australia and to Christ Church, for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">possible future earthquakes.&nbsp; Pay close attention to Japan, as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Japan needs much healing at this time.&nbsp; Pay particular attention</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to the pressures that have built up in California, and up along</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the coastline of off Oregon, Washington and off Canada and lower</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Alaska.&nbsp; Pay particular attention to pressures that have built up</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">as this is a weak point and pay particular attention also to the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">New Madrid fault, as there are pressures that have built up in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">this area and some of it is hanging all together and as we speak</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we are sending support and love light to this area for the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">strength of the rocks and the holding together.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Pay particular attention to the mid-Atlantic ridge; pay</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">particular attention to volcanic activity.&nbsp; There were some</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">volcanoes that also began to erupt or continued erupting. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Pay attention to the Cascades and volcanic movement under the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Cascades.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">And pay attention to the – and we may get beyond some of you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">here - to the sounds of the earth, to the sounds of the wildlife,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to the anticipation of the wildlife as they’re connected in a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">way with earth that humans are not.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; If animals start reacting unusually, will it be just in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the area of a potential earthquake or can it be very far away as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">well?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An</strong>:&nbsp; Whales and dolphins react at quite a distance away; the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">whole earth and all of the inhabitants, animals and the whole</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">consciousness of the earth in an area before an earthquake can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">begin to take on a hush, a quietness.&nbsp; So, it depends upon the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sensitivity of the species.&nbsp; Generally, if you’re speaking of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">animals, they will begin to react locally in the area of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">disturbance.&nbsp; There are sounds that come off, radio waves,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ringing of the earth that come off the earth and changes of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">pressure before earthquakes, which one can become sensitive to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and when they hear ear tones then can begin to sense direction</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that those ringings have come from, and begin to correlate the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">directions with earthquakes that are about to happen.&nbsp; Not all</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ringing creates earthquakes but most, although some are very</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">minor.&nbsp; It can be easy to misidentify a ringing to do with some</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">machine in the background that one might be picking up.&nbsp; So, one</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">needs to develop one’s sensitivity if one is interested in this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">area.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Terry seems to have some sensitivity in this area, I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">believe, as well as Daphne.&nbsp; Is that true?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Terry does have great sensitivity in this area; also</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">(some) individuals who tune into Jim Berkland’s website put</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">down their sensitivity (on his website).&nbsp; Terry does have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sensitivity and also getting headaches that are directional and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">are quite strong before earthquakes.&nbsp; Some individuals also have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">great sensitivity, and are able to see and sense disturbing</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">behavior in humans around them before earthquakes, for instance: </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">fighting, yelling at each other, getting very angry where</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ordinarily they wouldn’t.&nbsp; These can be picking up of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earthquake energies and expressing them in their physical</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">environment of the human.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; It’s 6:53 (p.m.) There is one question I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">didn’t ask which will probably pend off and that was the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earthquakes being stimulated by artificial, man-made things which</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I believe some happen.&nbsp; I’m not going to ask that question now,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">because we’re a few minutes over and so we’re going to bring</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">this to an end.&nbsp; We can just take ten seconds and just send love</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">light to all those earthquake locations that were mentioned.&nbsp; I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">thank everybody, and Don and Seth from BBS and everyone on the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">line.&nbsp; We’ll see you all Wednesday.</span><br /><br /></p>
