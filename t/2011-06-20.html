<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">This is Monday, June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2011the day after Father’s Day. I was just saying that - some of you know this and some of you are checking it out to see if it’s true and some of you are saying “What the hell is he talking about?” </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Those folks who are checking into the conference line are very important and have been very important, because they help ground the energy of the call. When you’re doing a conference line, before we were doing the call on BBS, we’ve been doing this for quite some time. That means it’s got an energy that’s grounded into the grids. Next week (I’m getting more courageous about announcing topics in advance), I’d like to talk about the grids, and how every one of us is making a difference in how that works. I can share with you the things that I’ve derived from my own observations, and then we’ll do a conversation with our sources and we’ll see if I’ve got it right and what they can add to it. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">This call, as they were describing it, is to be looked at as a group matrix. It’s not just me talking, there is good information that comes through. Sometimes when you hear good information you have an “aha!” experience: “Wow! That’s how it works!” Every time you have that, it’s a leap forward in your evolution – you’ve jumped, to a certain degree - maybe a lot maybe a little. But “aha!” experiences are very important. A lot of people on this line have “aha!” experiences. There are ways of looking at things and ways of how things work that you already know subconsciously, but no one has ever put it in words. When you hear it in words, your subconscious goes “aha!”. And suddenly, that thing that was in your subconscious goes into your consciousness and it moves you up a notch on your track. There is that aspect of these calls – information that creates “aha!” experiences. I know the topic we’re talking about tonight, for many people, created “aha!” experiences. We have more people checking in the past two weeks than normal; that’s because people are saying “Wow! Maybe that’s the way it works!” There’s one aspect of the “aha!” in the information. Then there’s the other aspect of what I call “the creation of a group matrix.” We do that, in particular, on Sundays; on Sundays it’s stronger. If you want to feel that energy, please come into our Sunday conference calls – conference. <a href="http://messageaday.net/" target="_blank">messageaday.net</a>; you’ll get the number. We do usually announce it an hour before, but many times that’s not enough to make plans. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">On these calls, the energy is also present, the matrix energy. It comes from the fact that we are being a portal on this call for what I call these group souls, or what explains themselves to be group souls, that are really high up in the evolutionary scale, you could say. They have the ability to become one with us, to connect with us. We have the ability to connect with each other, and that does not happen through an act of willpower; it does happen through an act of intention. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Some of you have been in relationships where you really wanted to be connected; even the other person wanted to be connected. But, no matter how hard you tried, you didn’t feel connected; you felt alienated. Maybe you had sexual interchange and you felt a connection, but it didn’t stick; it went away because it’s much better to have sexual intimacy when you have a connection in the spirit realms - or in the higher dimensions; or, in this matrix. When you experience it, you say “aha! That’s what he’s talking about.” Then you find out, slowly but surely, that everyone in your life is in that matrix, and some of them will connect with it through you. Now, you are being a very high service. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">The topic tonight is the continuation of “<i>Wanderers and Star seeds</i>”. If you’ve listened to our last two Mondays, we have two group souls that are high in the matrix. They identify themselves in certain ways, and they talk to me through Terry and Daphne. One group soul calls itself the Elohim group. The Elohim group takes credit (we can’t prove so you have to draw your own conclusions by listening to their messages over time) for creating the creation of the physical universe. At one point, there was no physical universe, but there were Elohim souls. They’ve explained where they came from and how it all works, but that’s not the topic of this call. They have the ability to move energy through the matrix, or beam into this realm – again, what they call <i>love-light energy</i> – but, they need people down here with their receivers to tune into their frequency and their antennae up, looking for them. The energy is subtle; it doesn’t hit you over the head. It’s actually an energy that when you feel it, it feels like you but just an extended you, a bigger you, which is actually the truth because we’re all one. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">The Elohim is on this call; they’re paying attention. We’ve learned, over time, they’re paying attention to us right now. If you’re on this call and you’re open to it you can say “It’s okay to pay attention to me” and you may feel like a little surge of energy through your body. At first you’ll think “Am I making that up? Is Wynn suggesting that?” So, you have to keep checking it out and learn about that energy and see if, in fact, it is this group soul that calls itself the Elohim. Of course, they talk to us – they talk to us as a group through Terry. That’s going to happen in just a few minutes. And the other group soul identifies itself as the Ra group. They did not create this realm, up to our conversations at present, but they’re graduates. They’re souls who have taken on bodies and come into this realm and then graduated. I suppose some of the Ra group could have been former Elohim who came into this realm and really got lost here and ended up in the Ra group; I guess that’s possible. I don’t think I’ve asked that question; maybe I will tonight. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Both group souls have volunteers that choose to come into this realm after they don’t have to – the Ra group and the Elohim group. In last week’s channelings, discussion about this – there will million upon millions upon millions, I think they said seventy million of Ra and ten million of the Elohim are in this realm. In most cases they’ve forgotten that they choose to do that, because once you take on a body in this realm, you have amnesia. When an Elohim soul comes into this realm, they call it a Star seed, and when a Ra group comes into this realm they call it a Wanderer. Both are different – both have different predispositions, both have different abilities, both have different ways of being of service. Many of the people who are attracted to this material that we’re presenting, and other spiritual groups, tend to be these inter-dimensional visitors. This material is helping them wake up. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">On this call, we’re going to ask – the topic is… if you are an Elohim soul and if you are a Ra soul, what can you do with that information? What is it that a Ra soul would have the best time and easiest time manifesting here, and what would an Elohim soul? We’re talking in generalities, because everyone listening is a totally unique being with their own path. Theirs is going to be certain generalities that are going to be true for most Elohim souls in this realm and certain ones for Ra souls. Then there are “mutts” – one time they said Terry was a mutt, that they were making, the Elohim – were making her an honorary member; that Daphne is more of a pure Elohim soul. Terry, we might find out why Terry became so open to Elohim energies on this call. With that all said, let me see – it’s 6:20 we can start early on and go into a conversation with them. We start out with a little invocation for the creation of this group matrix:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Father, Mother God we ask for the presence of the light to surround and protect Terry, myself and everyone on this line, and everyone on the replays; and that any negativity be taken to the higher realms of light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the galaxies, through the center of our galaxy, through the Milky Way, through the Solar System, through the planetary fields of the Sun, through the energy fields of the Earth and through our bodies and grounded into the center of the Earth. Some of you can feel the energy right now. Right now, we invoke a blending group energy connection of all of us on this line. and all of us on the replays, while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One, to join with us, and we create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave now. Before we started this recording, someone was on the line and they were talking about some of the negative sources that are down in this realm and even interdimensionally. That’s why we always create this protected space. It is like a wall between us and the higher sources; it’s very important when you make this connection with higher dimensions that you keep a lot of protection going. On that note, we wait for our sources to identify themselves, and any comments they want to make on Star seeds, etc. before I ask questions.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4"><b>Ra’an</b>: Thank you. We greet you in the love-light of the One Infinite Creator. This is June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2011 – planet Earth. We are pleased to be with you, and we are mindful of the questions that you have in mind that you have brought up on your introduction. We greet each and every person who is on the line and we consider the connection sacred, and the communication sacred, as it is not very many times in the history of mankind that we can have such connection. Daphne, in the past, has provided some part of the connection to the realm, and different lifetimes where she has also accessed the Elohim energy and channeled. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">We are mindful of your question about the difference between the Star seed, and the difference between the Elohim and the Ra/Wanderer. In answer to one of the questions that you brought up, the Star seed, the Elohim soul, when they come to the Earth realm or into any three dimensional circumstance – they have more of a working knowledge of the geometries in back of the creation of the realm and the creation of forms. So they do have a propensity for geometric configurations and mathematical configurations. As such, when they come in, they are less grounded in the actual – there is a word we are searching for here – mechanics in and outs of the financial systems, the workings of the third dimensional realm, the jealousies, the lower level emotions – that one may get into if they are in the realm, and they may not know how to handle these situations very well as they tend to be very pure and very loving souls. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Then the Ra group, the Wanderers, when they come into the realm, they have been grounded in Earth-type situations and they are more masters of how to survive and how to negotiate the ins and outs of the emotions in the third dimensional realm. Those are a couple of the differences between Wanderers and Star seeds and between the Ra group souls/group individuals, and the Elohim individuals.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4"><b>Wynn</b>: Thank you. In my own observations and in some of our previous conversations, it was discussed that the Elohim group comes in as groups in many cases – I don’t know if all cases, but many. They create circumstances in this realm where a group can come in and try to be comfortable here, so to speak. It’s been our understanding that the Mormon religion was basically started to be a way-station for Elohim souls to come into this realm. It’s probably the only religion that says “You came into this realm and when you leave, you’ll be creating stars and planets.” There was a conscious intention of the Elohim to bring through the doctrine that Elohim souls could flourish. If you study Mormons, and you look at Mormons, I’ve noted that they are different from other people in ways that I don’t think you can just attribute to their religion. If you happen to know Mormons you might run this by. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">One of the things about Mormons is that they tend to be successful; they tend to make money, they also tend to be very successful at multi-level marketing. There are a number of companies in Utah that are multi-level companies that are run, or their main distributors are Mormons. As I talk about this, there is no implication to that the Mormon religion is better than any other religion; just that it was, in particular, an attempt to bring Elohim souls into this realm to uplift the realm, because the Elohim souls have a certain amount of connection to the Elohim, an easy connection, which can bring a very high vibration in. The caveat here is, in many cases, even in that circumstance it’s gotten screwed up and they tend to lose their original purpose and caught up in the doctrine. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Going back to those things, using them as an example of Elohim Star seeds, they tend to create successful businesses. When I observe how that is done, it’s done inter-dimensionally. When a Mormon is doing a multi-level marketing company, they seem to have an inherit ability to create a family feeling in that company which is a crucial thing. I think you all know what multi-level is; it’s like Amway, HerbaLife, etc. Am I kind of hitting the nail on the head here with an Elohim soul having the ability to create family circumstance? Also, being able to project energy through geometries to create successful business ventures that fit that model?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4"><b>Ra’an</b>: We see that individuals who come in from the Elohim group tend to have a closer-knit family group, as their whole previous experience is based in love. It is through this caring that they are then able to be successful, as they include others within their sphere of influence.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4"><b>Wynn</b>: Okay. They also tend to take care of each other very well. On the other hand, there are people who would look (I don’t know if I should pick Mormons here as an example). I’m not going to say anything more about Mormons… Oh! One other thing – there is they tend to be attractive and they tend to be blonde, blue-eyed attractive. And, angelic sometimes – is that a quality of an Elohim soul in this realm?</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4"><b>Wynn</b>: Now – if somebody learned they were an Elohim soul, if they looked at the patternings the way we described it and it fit them, how could they use this information to enhance their life and their ability to be of service?</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4"><b>Ra’an</b>: They could know that they are not alone, that they have come from a higher realm and that they have a history of love and they have a history of interest in the higher realms in geometric configurations.

They are seeking fulfillment and they are seeking freedom, which adds to their moving around into different circumstances.</span></span></p>

So, they stick together and they have close-knit families, which does provide, as there is strength in numbers, and support – does help provide financially for the group. The Ra souls sometimes do not know what they keep searching for, and it is the love connection that as they have run into various emotional situations in the past and frustrations in war and frustrations in working through some of the more baser situations they run into in the Earth plane; they get confounded by that and were they to let all let go and connect more with the Elohim and the higher realms of oneness and love, they could find more what they are seeking for in their wanderings.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Channeled information is not meant to be believed blindly. Sometimes information may bleed through from the conscious mind of the channel. It is possible that a negative Source may interfere. Apply your own discernment, take only what resonates and discard the rest. An answer to a question is meant for the person asking the question and you have the privilege of listening in because sometimes you can gain insights from the answer. However,<span>&nbsp; </span>even though the circumstances may be similar, do not merely assume the answer applies to you.. This is not meant to replace seeing your doctor, dentist or any alternative practitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some people get healings here, so you can be open to it.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
