<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> This is Wedneday, September 14th, 2011 and Wynn and Terry<br />in Sedona and we are doing our Wednesday conference call.<br /><br /><br />(Wynn discusses negative attacks and speaks with several audience<br />members about their experiences. Please listen to the audio for<br />details).<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> One of the things about connecting to the higher sources,<br />no matter where you are normally positioned in the matrix and<br />it's not easy to shift that positioning quickly.&nbsp; It takes lots<br />and lots of lifetimes, but no matter where you are positioned you<br />have the potential to look upwards as well as downwards. It<br />doesn't mean you are not supposed to look downwards, because you<br />are in the world and you have to look downwards, but to connect<br />to the energies that are behind you as well as in front of you.<br />Then you are in a good position and you start to grow at the<br />fastest rate. The key is, is someone making decisions for you or<br />are you making them for yourselves. Is someone teaching you how<br />to make decisions or are they making them for you. Many psychics<br />that are doing it to make a living want you to be addicted to<br />them so you can spend money every week and so they make<br />decisions for you. We are talking about negative attacks, not<br />about that. That would be an example of a negative interaction.<br />We are talking about things that come upon you that you can't<br />figure out where they are coming from, that keep you compressed,<br />they keep you in fear, they keep you contained, they keep you in<br />panic and out of balance, and how to rid yourselves of those kind<br />of things.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> So I will now mute everyone (Wynn does an invocation to<br />call in the light, please listen to audio for details)<br /><br /><br />We await for our Sources to identify and greet us.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite<br />Creator. Today is September 14, 2011. As Zoe has noticed, the<br />energies have been difficult, as Terry has noticed, as Wynn has<br />noticed. The energies, in their particular configuration as they<br />impact and cut through the earth field at this time are difficult<br />considerations. So one can buckle down and expect that they may<br />have little disruptions in the electronics and in their computers<br />and that they need to buckle up with a patience that this will<br />pass. We are very happy to make contact with those who wish it.<br />Do you have questions?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Yes. Thank you very much. We started out having a<br />discussion on negative attacks, particularly focused on Chris who<br />is having negative attacks. So perhaps you can just give us an<br />overall discourse on negative attacks.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you. You have introduced the topic with much<br />pertinent data. There are a number of influences at play at this<br />time, that we have already mentioned, with the configuration, with<br />the star system. As you move into the fall, the sun is not as<br />available, the weather changes, the days begin to get shorter and<br />weather patterns shift. As one is in the northern hemisphere and<br />the movement into the fall time creates a change that is slow, day<br />by day, but moves one into a different mode. The children go back<br />to school, the world buckles down into a routine. The children<br />being gone in the day doing their school routines, and the earth<br />itself moving into shorter days and more length during the period<br />of darkness. It is a time of change that individuals adapt. This<br />change can sometimes be difficult, and weather change can bring<br />different modes and moods to individuals. Other negative attacks<br />can be when tempers fly due to the configuration of the stars in<br />their intersection energy points with earth. As they exert a<br />strong influence that is generally not known. The moon also<br />exerts an influence that is similarly unseen and the unseen<br />influence is then exerted upon the tides and the full moon comes<br />into play. It is also exerted in a smaller way upon the<br />individuals body system. So one can then run into the need to<br />modify their daily patterns, and become frustrated to some degree<br />with these gravitational pulls upon your body, however slight.<br /><br />Individuals who are carrying weak areas in their patterns which<br />can be generated from a number of reasons. They can be generated<br />by attachments, from influence, from others in their vicinity,<br />picking up of thoughts of others in the consensus reality,<br />picking up negativity from the media, as you have just gone<br />through a period where negativity from 9-11 has been spread all<br />over the media which creates an upset as one listens to that, and<br />can trigger past upsets, and can trigger tempers to flare also.<br />Individuals from high negative can use these moments to ride on<br />the energy and feel a sense of energy moving through them from<br />the negative adrenaline rushes that an individual may get. Those<br />are some of the areas where negativity can come into play but<br />there are also. One of them is the subtle influence from the<br />economy. When individuals are not getting their needs met, they<br />tend to be unhappy and then to spread that feeling to others in<br />their vicinity as they are not feeling expansive and outgoing.<br />This can trigger past feelings of inadequacy and this can<br />compound the issue. These are some of the areas where people can<br />experience negative attack. That is our answer.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> You know we were talking earlier about some different kinds<br />of negative attachments and I just thought we can just have some<br />more expansion of these ideas. I am sure I am correct and feel<br />free to clarify it, where there is one kind of negative<br />attachment that is in your matrix and like welded to it and<br />continues lifetime after lifetime and then there is another kind<br />of attachment that would be like a visitor that would come and<br />go. What is the cause of these two different kinds of negative<br />attachments?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you. One of the ways that an attachment can get<br />welded to someone is doing an explosion as a soldier may be in a<br />field and may experience an explosion with a couple of this<br />friends next to him and in the blinding flash of light, their<br />time sense of each of them, resets to the flash; they orient to<br />the flash simultaneously and they lets say they lose their body<br />matrix at the time and since the flash and the sound and the<br />tearing apart of the explosive device, since it acts<br />simultaneously on all of the three, they orient their attention<br />to that instant in time. It give them a basis for moving on<br />together and the confusion as they have lost their physical body<br />matrix at that time and they move on and can become confused<br />about their identity. That is one type and way individuals can be<br />welded together.<br /><br />With the visiting matrix, if an individual has sex and the<br />partner has attachments, he may extend his matrix into the other<br />person's and with it an entity that can share time and space with<br />the other one and may move in and out and visit. Another way, is<br />if an individual may receive a heart or live impart, the<br />individual may cling to the body part and move into the person<br />who receives the body part and seek to experience life through<br />the body part. This is where you have individuals who develop a<br />liking for say, drinking beer and before receiving the body part<br />had no interest in beer. Those are two a few of the ways.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> How about in negative rituals, say ceremonies which we know<br />happen. Do some of these negative rituals creates a welding of<br />the negative into the human matrix?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes they do. There are certain secret rituals who in<br />certain organization which unfortunately result in this happening<br />or certain rituals who promote sending of entities to take them<br />over and to move them into further sickness by determining the<br />weakness the individual has and then sending the entities to<br />attack that particular area of the body that is weak such as<br />voodoo. So yes, there are negative ceremonies that make use of<br />this, yes.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Do these things become permanently welded, or are can they<br />become removed easily. By that I mean one that goes from lifetime<br />to lifetime versus one that is more temporary. Do those kind of<br />ceremonies create permanent bonds?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Those kinds of ceremonies do not necessarily create<br />permanent bonds but the criteria here is if the individual<br />himself has participated or experienced say of being in an<br />explosion and losing this own matrix and then is holding on to<br />the others in an attempt to reconstruct a matrix or how to move<br />on. It is how much participation did the individual himself have<br />in the setting up or the reconfiguration of his matrix to have<br />this happen. It does not mean that the person has done something<br />wrong or has purposely tried to move into such a state but it is<br />the reconfiguration of his matrix to include such an entity.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Can we look at the human population and say what percentage<br />have had some experience in the past where they were involved in<br />an explosion and had other entities attached to them? Is that<br />very common among humans.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An</strong>: As it is not remembered and as it is somewhat frightening<br />to think about, it is a touchy subject. However sometimes opening<br />up a subject can lead to a solution and we can say that quite<br />often an individuals has that but does not know. The ways they<br />can tell if they seem to have thoughts that are not their own or<br />if they have impulses they have to fight all the time that they<br />have something going on with them that they have to fight and<br />fight. Psychic pressure areas within their space. Thoughts that<br />occur within the body but not outside that location. Those are<br />some of the signs.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn</strong>: Is it possible to separate yourself if you are thinking you<br />might have this?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> It is. One of the biggest tools is just observation and<br />just letting ideas that are no welcome to flow through you and<br />not judge them or fight them but just judge them but let those<br />which are not welcome to just flow through you and to give<br />permission for any untoward influences to just leave. We wish to<br />say one other things here. One of the things that happens in<br />psychology on your planet at this time is that individuals are<br />told to sometimes to let parts of them that are unworkable to<br />simply die and then they notice a degree of resistance to that,<br />and that is another sign that there is something else there that<br />can be released. Just give them love and release them and let<br />them go and once they go they will take the unwanted attitudes<br />with them.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Gjis brought up the question that there were some nuclear<br />explosions a long time ago, anywhere to ten thousand years ago to<br />perhaps millions of years ago and when there were these nuclear<br />explosions created tangled web of souls that were bonded<br />together. The question is, we know that the Ra Group has worked<br />with at least one we know of as Maldek from the Carla Ruckert<br />channelings and that when Maldek exploded it resulted in knotted<br />mass of souls and the Ra Group untangled them by bringing them<br />into incarnations on earth in Neanderthal man and continuing to<br />evolve. In those circumstances where there is a tangle of souls,<br />on the grid healings, is there a way we could use our group<br />energy and focus on that that could be of any assistance?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes. When you put the light into a certain area there is<br />an actual a tone, an actual light that is created and if this is<br />directed to such individuals can go to them and lift them.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />I have a question. We had spoken Monday about the Annunaki<br />creating; genetically engineering the first humans which were<br />combinations of their genes and apes and the Ra Group bringing<br />tangled masses of souls to be worked out on the earth. Was there<br />interaction between the Ra Group and beings on the planet who<br />were genetically creating forms?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An</strong>: The Annunaki were genetically creating beings who could<br />survive in the earth's atmosphere. There was more than one<br />instance of humans on earth as the cycle has been several times<br />that the humans developed on earth and then in a nuclear blast<br />become nearly extinct, not in the same state of civilization.<br />This has been a cycle that has been repeated quite a few times on<br />earth. So the individuals who were developed from the earth, say<br />23,000 years ago or so, were given souls that could work out<br />their karma by the Ra Group and also earlier souls were brought<br />in as Maldek exploded millions of years go. Early man were given<br />these souls so that they could work out this entanglement as it<br />has taken millions of years to work it out and it is still not<br />worked out totally.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you so much for sharing this information on this<br />topic which is something that very few people pay attention to or<br />are aware of. I wanted to go to a couple of people who have had<br />healings on this line and then we will end this call. One is my<br />sister and her husband. Her husband is on the line. She still<br />goes through a lot of issues in her body and Mary had sent me a<br />whole list of symptoms. She is bedridden. Her right thigh and arm<br />which is enlarged, another had to do with her bladder. She is in<br />pain. She was recommended to have a more alkaline diet and it has<br />helped but it's still severe. There is a whole list of things<br />here. Maybe I will take each one of these at a time. Her right<br />thigh and arm are twice as large as her left side and they don't<br />know why. Do you want to make any comments on that?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> As the symptoms go together to a major cause is a lack of<br />flow of liquids in and out of the body. As you have mentioned the<br />kidney and the pain from the kidney and the whole flow of liquids<br />in and out of the body. There is a blockage in the lymph areas<br />that is backing up fluid into the cells. Do you have other<br />symptoms.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn</strong>: Is there anything that can be done like massage to move the<br />lymph?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Continue to work with the bringing of alkalinity to the<br />body and the replenishing the body with B vitamins. Dr.<br />Marshall's vitamins are recommended and they are from a live<br />source. There are some difficulties in using B vitamins from<br />other sources. Massage can always help to stimulate the body,<br />particularly when one is laid up in bed. Gentle message. The<br />liver, which is the area which detoxifies waste can be stimulated<br />to work towards dispensing waste better, however the kidneys need<br />to be fortified first in order to be able to move the toxins off<br />and be able to move the waste out from the swollen side of the<br />body. One of the key things here is to stimulate and heal the<br />kidneys. You may take a look at Marshall's formulations and speak<br />with someone at Marshall's office concerning the stimulation and<br />the care of the kidneys to help support and heal the kidneys that<br />they may heal of that pain and to move the toxins off and to be a<br />good channel for the flow of the build up of liquids that is<br />causing the swelling of the right side. The strengthening of the<br />kidneys will be a doorway toward the release of other toxins also<br />in the body from the liver and the gall bladder and these areas<br />of the body. That is our answer.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Any comments on her osteoporosis. Has the bone loss<br />stopped?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Moving into an alkaline body is a very good start. Dr.<br />Marshall has a vitamin D3 that would be very beneficial to<br />strengthening the bones and helping the absorption of minerals<br />within the body. It is very easy to take and by taking a few<br />drops of vitamin D 3 from a little dispenser bottle. In the<br />maintaining of the alkaline body, this will help strengthen the<br />bones. The acidity of the body has been one of the reasons why<br />the bones has deteriorated. There is a certain formulation that<br />can help both the maintaining of alkaline body and to stay on the<br />routine is fairly easy. In the mornings to take some gold calcium<br />powder in water and aloe vera with it and to take cod liver oil.<br />This will all help the bone system.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />Moving on. Dee Collier asks for support and healing for her and<br />her husband. For her husband Bobby who is struggling daily with<br />his health and to just put this in the light. Carolyn Ware in<br />Rhode Island is looking for a job and we just ask for healing<br />light for all those on the call and those who are listening. It<br />did come up that right now we are going through a difficult time<br />and a lot of people are experiencing a very difficult time right<br />now. How long would we expect this cycle to last before this<br />cycle lifts?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> It is not a consistent strength of dissonance, however as<br />the full moons come, it will intensify between the full moons and<br />will lessen. Some days will be harder working with this energy.<br />Those are our comments.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you. On that note we will leave room for any closing<br />comments.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We send love light to each and every one of you on the<br />call and our energy heart goes out to you all. You are living in<br />an environment that is difficult and we admire your fortitude and<br />send you support and light.<br /><br />Adonai<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you<br /><br />I would invite anyone who is listening if you can, we are doing<br />something new on our grid healings and it's kind of exciting. At<br />the end of the sessions we have little chat rooms open for people<br />to meet and talk to each other. This particular Sunday, in one of<br />the rooms, Suzanne Hayes is doing a discussion group on the Law<br />of One. If you would like yourself to understand the Ra Group she<br />is kind of an expert but it's not just the information but a<br />chance to talk to each other and share thoughts in a small group<br />environment on the phone. We will see you all next time and thank<br />you all for coming and thank you to Gjis for greeting everybody<br />on the call. <br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Copyright 2002-2011 Wynn Free and Message a Day &nbsp;This<br />transcription may be freely shared, provided this copyright<br />notice and contact information is included and there is no<br />charge.
