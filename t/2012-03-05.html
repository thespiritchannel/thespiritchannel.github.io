<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;</span>Alright – this is Monday, March 5, (2012) and we’re supposed to be on the air.<span>&nbsp; </span>Are we on the air?<span>&nbsp; </span>Terry?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Terry:</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>I’m here.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re hooked up<b>.</b></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>We did it – good work!<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re not NBC; we’re not ready to go on NBC.<span>&nbsp; </span>I announced an unusual topic tonight.<span>&nbsp; </span>Are any of our topics usual?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">What we do on these calls is non-linear.<span>&nbsp; </span>What does non-linear mean?<span>&nbsp; </span>It means it’s multidimensional – it means that there is a lot going on at the same time.<span>&nbsp; </span>On one level, we’re having conversations with an intelligence in another dimension that say that they created the physical universe.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’ve given us a lot of guidance and instruction on how the universe works.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of the things have never ever been brought out into the world, in my knowledge, and it’s strange to be in the middle of doing that.<span>&nbsp; </span>We could be wrong; they mi8ght not be who they say they are.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tell people,“Make up your own mind.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The other thing that happens on this call besides the verbal communications is that there is an energy on the call.<span>&nbsp; </span>People all over the world are telling me that they can feel the energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a subtle energy that feels like you expand, you get bigger, we touch each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s this idea of communion in Christianity; I have the idea that what we are doing on this call, if you named it communion it would probably fit.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems like what communion is; it’s not social, it happens on the inner level and it comes from the inside out.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When we’ve talked to interdimensional friends; when we’ve talked to them they say that they exist outside of time, and they have the ability to flow through the field and enter this realm as what they call “love-light vibration” or love-light energy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It seems that when we are feeling that energy on the call, one explanation for it, if you want to match their words is, “That’s them.”<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re out there, up there – and we’ve learned how to tune into their frequency and they can flow their energy into this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>When we make connection with their energy – to call it their energy would be slightly off.<span>&nbsp; </span>What we’ve learned is there is no such thing as their, that they are us and we are them – it’s all one.<span>&nbsp; </span>In order to go from that as a mental construct, as an idea – to an experience – you have to enter this expanded space which we could call the field, the unity field – all kinds of names.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe you call it ‘Holy Spirit’, maybe you call it prana, Chi.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, in this space where there is no time or space and everything just becomes present – we never lose ourselves.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You have to be on this call for a while, some people do.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some people get it right away.<span>&nbsp; </span>(But) when you’re first on the call it always seems like you’re looking for something other, something big – Oh My God they’re the Elohim!<span>&nbsp; </span>They created the universe!<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re BIG.<span>&nbsp; </span>They may be big, but I don’t know if the word ‘big’ applies, because if you’re in a place with no space or time, how can you be big?<span>&nbsp; </span>How can you be small?<span>&nbsp; </span>You’re just everything.<span>&nbsp; </span>You flow through, like surfing this unity field and you arrive.<span>&nbsp; </span>These beings say, “We’re here and we’re tuned into your frequency.”<span>&nbsp; </span>They show up.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then, you have this energy coursing through you, but it’s your energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>It starts with you, and then they join it.<span>&nbsp; </span>They become one.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would be in the physical world like a bunch of people walking into a room, all coming from their own separate locations – an auditorium – and there is something going to take place.<span>&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, everyone is feeling together because they’re all in the same room and they’re feeling together in that room because they’re participating in the same experience.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is similar, except there’s no room.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s just a telephone line.<span>&nbsp; </span>We didn’t know that we could do this on a telephone line.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems to have happened historically easiest and best when people congregate, when people come together, because then you have all your body energies in the same room.<span>&nbsp; </span>It makes the body energies come together and then it’s easy for the spirit to come in.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve learned how to do it on a phone line – notice the energy in the space.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s the energy; it comes in.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re not talking to us, but the energy is here.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">What I wanted to do tonight is work with that energy and work with some of the people on the line who would like to feel that energy move through them.<span>&nbsp; </span>In particular, one of the reasons I called this topic this evening is because a few days ago I got an email from an old friend of mine in </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Los Angeles</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> who is Lou.<span>&nbsp; </span>He sent it to all of his friends and he actually created quite a havoc.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m going to open up the lines – I don’t think he’s shy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Lou, are you there?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>I haven’t seen Lou for ten years.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lou sent an email out to all his friends saying,“Send me prayers, I’m going into the hospital in a few days and I’m having open heart surgery for something serious.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I called Lou today and I said, “Lou, come to our call.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He has not been coming to our calls; he never came to a call before.<span>&nbsp; </span>Actually, I met Lou when this was all first starting for me.<span>&nbsp; </span>We had a common friend, Howard, <span>&nbsp;</span>I think we went out to lunch a couple of time.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was telling Lou all my stories and Howard all my stories; the book had just come out with David Wilcock.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think it was probably 2003 – 2004.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lou happens to be Catholic; he goes to church every Sunday, he has done a lot of good (and) helped a lot of people.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lou, tell us about yourself.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m still trying to make my movies.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have one called “The Water Garden” about a guy who works in a gas boiler room and finds himself through saving some little ducklings, rescuing some little ducklings on the property – he rescues them and they rescue him (metaphysically).<span>&nbsp; </span>I like to do metaphysical work.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I find out that as a gift from God because I hadn’t had a W-2 for anybody my whole life; I always worked for myself.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had been looking around for something to do in 2009; I’ve been sending resumes out for six years and finally I got this job.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wound up getting the health insurance; and, when I got the health insurance I started going on all these doctor’s tests and all, started to treat myself.<span>&nbsp; </span>They found murmurs at the cardiologists, and it turns out that I have this condition that John Ritter had.<span>&nbsp; </span>He said, “There’s gray area in medicine, but I don’t have gray area.<span>&nbsp; </span>I got black and white.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He said “I have to get this fixed.”<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s an aneurysm that could blow up.<span>&nbsp; </span>So that’s where I am now.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">He’s busy preparing as if he’s in his last three years.<span>&nbsp; </span>I said, “We should ask and see what they say.”<span>&nbsp; </span>The answer, I’m going to try and paraphrase this, was:<span>&nbsp; </span>“You have control of your body.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can make things shift in your body.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can tell the viruses to go.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, they said, “If you do that, we’ll help you.”<span>&nbsp; </span>But, it has to start with him.<span>&nbsp; </span>It wasn’t going to be some outside force that was going to do it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I thought that was a really interesting idea because I think when people pray, they think, “God, heal me.<span>&nbsp; </span>God, do this…”<span>&nbsp; </span>The answer was, “You do it and we’ll help.”<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s that particular three-year time line doesn’t even have to hold.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I got my email from Lou who is going in for this very serious condition that he has, and I said I was going to do this call tonight and I was going to open it up for some other people as well. <span>&nbsp;</span>Are all of you okay if we bring our sources in and ask about your issues?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Right now, you are surrounded by (we could call them) angel(s), or very loving entities.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re going to allow that energy to become one with us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Remember, everything is one so they are us, they are parts of ourselves, that are here to help us.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re making this stream of energy that goes back to our group soul friends who are able to project into this realm and when they do that I don’t know if these angelic forces are them, or if they just come in and join – I’m not sure.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, there has been many instances of people having shifts in physical problems as a result of this work.<span>&nbsp; </span>All of you who would like that, I want you right now – I’m not Benny Hinn (that guy on TV who people come up and he pushes them over); this is not Benny Hinn speaking.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re doing it differently.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is an experiment to see how focusing on this might or might not shift some pattern that you are holding in your body.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Shut your eyes and those of you who are on the call regularly are aware that our sources come in through the top of your head, through your crown chakra.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are very real; they exist.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can move through time and space and see that energy coming through your crown chakra – this is what we do on Sundays – and moving through your body.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When you do this yourself, be very sure to include this in however you make that request because otherwise you get negative greetings.<span>&nbsp; </span>You get panic attacks.<span>&nbsp; </span>You get things that you can’t explain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes you may have to get those anyway to learn how to go through them and master them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes a negative attack is when everything else fails and you still have it, it means there is some kind of exercise you need to do.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re a body-builder and you’re pushing so much weight and suddenly the weight gets harder you need to build your muscles up with a new weight.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and for the individuals concerned, we recognize the gravity of what they are facing and going through in that they consider it is a situation that is very severe.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have several people who have brought forth their issues and there are several layers of ways to look at these issues.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One of them is from the strict medical viewpoint of the doctor’s opinion.<span>&nbsp; </span>As we look out over the range of repertoire of different doctors, we see the expertise of different doctors as being quite varied.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many of the doctors, in fact most of the doctors, have not had proper training in the area of nutrition and have not considered what the body needs in order to grow and to repair.<span>&nbsp; </span>They consider the body as a mechanism that can be fixed or held in status quo through drugs and medicines, and we indicate that Lisa is in that situation.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The doctors are not providing a treatment that will fix the condition, but only to hold it in abeyance and to gradually, as the body does not have what it needs to repair sufficiently, then it will continue to have more things go wrong.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is the case with much of the response that doctors give to situations.<span>&nbsp; </span>They do not take into account what a body needs physically to repair itself.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are many doctors that give away prescriptions like candy without investigating the outcomes or correlating the desired outcome with the imagined outcome.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of these areas is with something that’s very important and understanding this could lengthen a majority of people’s lives by one-third.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is with the importance of digestion.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As an individual gets older, they use up their ability to make enzymes and one of the reasons that they use up this ability is because they do not give themselves the proper building blocks to make the chemicals necessary within their body to make the digestive enzymes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One such thing is salt – not Morton’s Salt that has been heated so hot that it has been altered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sea Salt – or, there are other salts – that are very healthy and when taken in perhaps one teaspoon with food or one teaspoon in liquid.<span>&nbsp; </span>One way to make hydrochloric acid is to increase the salt so that the body has the building blocks to be able to make the hydrochloric acid.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the most important keys is having enough hydrochloric acid in the stomach to be able to digest and break down one’s food.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The drugstores are lined with digestive aids; they tell you you’ve got too much hydrochloric acid – not hydrochloric – but, they say you have too much acid in your stomach and that’s the reason for heartburn and the reason that you have a problem when you eat and you can’t digest your food.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is false; you have the wrong kind of acid.<span>&nbsp; </span>You need hydrochloric acid there.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is one area for you to investigate.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is one level of healing.<span>&nbsp; </span>To get the nutrients that you really need, to get the information that you need to learn how to provide your body with nutrients so you can begin the healing cycle instead of relying on these prescriptions.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is another level of healing but give us minute.<span>&nbsp; </span>We look at the other people who have spoken.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We are mindful of Chris’ issues, and mindful of the problems with hepatitis C and diabetes.<span>&nbsp; </span>As we move into a higher level, a higher layer of healing, there is healing that can be dictated by the individual as the individual at a higher level through where he is at in his emotions and where he is in the action/reaction in his life, may pull in blockages and blockages can prevent flow.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is not much time on this call so we will go to a more general look.<span>&nbsp; </span>When one can look at it from the highest level, one can see that one has control over the physical universe to the degree that one has the ability to take control.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is either easy if one has the tools at his fingertips, (or hard if one does not have the tools) such as manipulation of vibration, control over manifestation to change and shift manifestation and (ability) to take out areas of manifestation that are unwarranted or not beneficial.<span>&nbsp; </span>This takes a great master to be able to manage this.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When one talks about the movie, <i>The Secret</i>, there is a way to change things, but it takes the knowledge of how to affect all the components.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are a free-will granting body of energies; so by free will, we need a consensus in order to change something.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, the person’s intention needs to be strong that they wish the situation to be healed.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the individual does not have the strong intention, perhaps the individual has another outcome that they are seeking, or something they are trying to avoid.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are not saying that any of you have that condition.<span>&nbsp; </span>We do not see that.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are giving that as data. </span></p>
