<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Wynn:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>You are what you are.<span>&nbsp; </span>Terry’s definitely an interdimensional being who was… there are a lot of people like this out there.<span>&nbsp; </span>They carry really high promise, or high potential, to make huge contributions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many of you who are listening now may fit into that category, where you know you have something to offer.<span>&nbsp; </span>And somehow or another, Terry ended up finding she had this unusual talent that she didn’t know she had in her interaction with me, which was: <span>&nbsp;</span>she was able to bring through messages from sources supposedly, seemingly, outside this dimension.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, she did do it once before, apparently, she did a channeling class, I think in 1998 or something.<span>&nbsp; </span>She got up in front of the room, and something happened. [It was 1995 and Terry did a channeling.]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">One of the things - I was thanking all the people that were actually checking into the conference line in particular, as well as the people who are listening on BBS. [For] the people on the conference line [it] is a more grounded energy, because we’re connected by wires instead of by radio waves or internet waves.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">One of the reasons Terry started channeling around me - and this is not an unusual occurrence - Carla Rueckert has two people around her when she channels.<span>&nbsp; </span>When we have a number of people coming in on the conference line, regularly, and when they start to feel the energy and they feel like this is a home base for them energetically, they start holding the space.<span>&nbsp; </span>The space that’s being held becomes like a bridge that actually enables Terry to bring through information.<span>&nbsp; </span>Without a bridge the stuff is just out there, and - imagine if Terry went into the supermarket, she just came from the supermarket, and came up to the cashier and suddenly said “Hi, I’ve got a message for you” … now, Sedona people probably do that … but “Hi, I have a message for you from another dimension.”<span>&nbsp; </span>If she was lucky, they’d just smile and if she wasn’t lucky they’d call the men in the white coats and have her taken away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">In order to bring information and messages and energy from other dimensions, it has to be grounded into this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>It becomes grounded into this realm through people.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are the grounds.<span>&nbsp; </span>It can’t be just any people; it can’t be somebody who is sitting there in doubt and skepticism.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s okay if you are, but you’re not going to be a good ground.<span>&nbsp; </span>You have to become familiar enough with the whole procedure so that you feel comfortable with it.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re not comfortable, your energy is going to be incongruent, and you won’t be able to ground it.<span>&nbsp; </span>The people on the conference call who come in regularly, we have to thank them because they’re helping to hold the grounded energy so this can come through.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, they can also thank us because by the nature of doing this, of being on the call and holding the energy, they’re also learning the frequencies of these higher sources.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re also doing a great service, and it’s an opportunity to do a service.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a mutual gratitude society, but I’m mentioning it and I’m acknowledging it, because even though you’re silently in the background you’re very important to this work.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">The only reason we’re doing this is because people kept showing up on the conference calls.<span>&nbsp; </span>If no one did, this would have died a long time ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t have any need to be on radio and talk; I do have a need to be of service, and I do have a need to be authentic.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I know what we’re doing is connecting with people, then I’m encouraged to keep doing it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I sent out a thing on Thanksgiving.<span>&nbsp; </span>Actually, it’s not easy for me to say those things but I did it anyway.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those of you that are on messageaday saw all my thank yous to all of you.<span>&nbsp; </span>All of you who are reading the messages, all of you who are listening to the replays - are part of grounding something.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Obviously, what we’re doing is out there.<span>&nbsp; </span>It does not fit in consensus reality.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are no places to plug it in.<span>&nbsp; </span>You have to create a socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>You have to create it if there is such a thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>The people that pay attention become part of anchoring the energy, not just during this call, but anchoring a new paradigm into the collective.<span>&nbsp; </span>What we do is not in the collective, it’s nowhere to be found.<span>&nbsp; </span>It does not fit in easily to even channeling and New Age, and it’s certainly not religious.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have to create our own way to fit in.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">The people who keep coming back and the people who keep listening – listening even when I don’t know who you are – I do know you’re doing this.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do know that your presence on the line is enabling a shift to occur in the collective.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s also creating the possibility that we can reach a whole lot more people.<span>&nbsp; </span>The more accurate and grounded it is, the more stable it becomes, the more people are attracted to it.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re kind of pioneers, and you guys are pioneers.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just want to give you kudos for doing it, okay?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Terry, without channeling do you have anything to say on this topic?<span>&nbsp; </span>Does that make sense to you?<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">I had a very interesting topic today.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I pick these topics, Terry never knows what I’m coming up with until she’s on the call.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s another thing – it took me quite a long time to develop the confidence that we could do this, and that I wouldn’t ask Terry a question and she wouldn’t go “Duh?”<span>&nbsp; </span>Terry is pretty shy, and also there’s a great responsibility in bringing information forth like this live.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can’t retrieve anything, you can’t take it back.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you make a really bad mistake, it’s out there.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s really been Terry’s dedication to make this possible to do this in this kind of way.<span>&nbsp; </span>It may be trust; trust that in general I don’t think there’s anything negative that comes through.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe there’s some bleed-through.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometime privately, I’m going to have a long conversation with them about Dr. Marshall and see.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">As I understand the way it works; as I watch it, there’s not a ‘them’ and an ‘us’, there’s only an ‘us’.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you have a group energy, Terry’s energy – this is not true of all channeling, by the way – this would be the way it works, the way it occurs for me:<span>&nbsp; </span>When you have a person who is channeling with a group soul, it’s not a group soul and them.<span>&nbsp; </span>They kind of temporarily become part of the group soul, and everything gets filtered through them.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s why, if you listen to Daphne, and you listen to Terry, you’ll hear quite a big difference in the way it sounds.<span>&nbsp; </span>It goes through the hologram of that person and becomes one with the group soul.<span>&nbsp; </span>Would you say that’s true, Terry? Is that accurate from your experience?<span>&nbsp; </span>Is that a good way of saying it?<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Terry:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s filtered through the vocabulary of the person.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know that there’s such a thing as trance channeling, where you just go under and then you don’t know what’s being said.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think I’ve gone into that state a couple times, like one time when we were speaking a different language for a little bit - I was aware that we were greeting people.<span>&nbsp; </span>That was when we greeted Betul in Turkey.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Wynn:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>Edgar Cayce could be called a trance channel, because he never remembered what he said.<span>&nbsp; </span>In that case, I don’t think his consciousness was part of the group.<span>&nbsp; </span>The group was using his consciousness.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think when that occurs, you might get deeper information because when you’re part of the group then it’s harder to [get deeper information]. Probably Daphne gets into more of a trance sometimes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because when you get this really specific information, the conscious mind of the channel would have a harder time assimilating it and saying it.<span>&nbsp; </span>So you have to, like, almost like let go and not participate as part of the group, but you’re separate and they’re using you.<span>&nbsp; </span>So Edgar Cayce did that, Carla Rueckert did that when she did <i>The Law of One</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t think she does it when she does Q’uo, I hope I’m saying that right.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Of course, occasionally we’ve gotten that kind of precision through both Daphne and Terry;<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, when I said, “Was Terry ever anybody famous?”<span>&nbsp; </span>Out of the blue, they said “St. Catherine of Sienna,” whom I had never heard of, that looked like… of course, you know the story, that looked like Terry and she was a channel in the Catholic Church that was actually, I believe, perhaps, the only channel ever officially recognized in the Catholic Church and it’s still for sale on Amazon.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">I have a very interesting topic, and one of the reasons I’m willing to talk about this topic is because so many of you are holding and have learned to hold a higher energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a topic that could be scary, and I wouldn’t want to just go out into the public and say “Hey, here’s something I want to talk about,” because first of all it’s hard to prove.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although in certain ways, there’s been proof.<span>&nbsp; </span>Second of all, it explains certain things that are very hard to explain otherwise.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>The good part of this is that many of you who have been listening to our calls and coming to our conference lines have actually come closer, more face-to-face, with your own issues.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’ve looked at your issues more carefully.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many of you have said, “Why do I still have this issue?” I’ve been coming in on the conference line for a year.<span>&nbsp; </span>Why are certain issues so difficult to get over?<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a not a new topic to me, it’s not a new topic, but it’s one that’s probably new for most of you.<span>&nbsp; </span>The topic is “Implants.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">An implant would mean anything that is not you that is affecting your system.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have learned there’s two kinds of implants.<span>&nbsp; </span>One kind of implant is in your energy field.<span>&nbsp; </span>The other kind of implant is actually in your body.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know this is true; I know… this is something that I don’t usually talk about, but I do know that there is such a thing as abductions.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have some idea why they take place, and I have some idea what happens when you get abducted.<span>&nbsp; </span>A lot of this is not from channeling, but it’s from cross-referencing lots of information on the internet and having personally known some people who have been, who believe they’ve been, abducted.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve known them well enough to be fairly sure that it happened for them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">This is a big topic – why do people get abducted?<span>&nbsp; </span>What happens when you get abducted?<span>&nbsp; </span>What are implants?<span>&nbsp; </span>If you have an implant, how do you get rid of them? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">I’m going to tell you a story of someone who wants to remain anonymous, leave anonymous, who had a reading from Terry a few months ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope its okay to tell this story.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m not going to say who it is.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m telling it because it’s something that I think will help other people, and I think they wouldn’t object to sharing it as long as they are anonymous.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was a person who was dealing with an issue for many years of his life where he was - to say ‘not fitting in’ would be an understatement.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was living almost anonymously under the radar.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had a tremendous amount of fear running through his system.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m not sure he knew what he was afraid of, but he was afraid.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having fear in your system that doesn’t seem to be – no reason to be, nothing externally was happening, and yet it’s there.<span>&nbsp; </span>Particularly, if you have money and you’re not starving, obviously when any of our lives get threatened in some way and things gets tough, fear is a natural response.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this person’s case, there was nothing obvious to be afraid of.<span>&nbsp; </span>They had a reading through Terry, and in the reading it was brought up that this person had an implant in their nose, and that their energy was being drained through this implant.<span>&nbsp; </span>The implant was placed there to keep track of them, and to tap into their energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you say “keep track,” are you going to say, “Who is keeping track?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does this work?”<span>&nbsp; </span>Perhaps I’ll go into that a little bit, this is a whole new sphere of information that I’ve never brought up in these calls. So I’ll go a little bit at a time, and see where we get with it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Then I asked our source, “Can you disable this implant?”<span>&nbsp; </span>They looked at it and they said it had actually melded with the DNA, and that it was not easy but they kept looking at it then they said “Well, we could shift the frequency.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Then they said they shifted the frequency.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">This was a fairly interesting channeling because we had never come up with anyone who came for a reading that was told they had an implant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, for some people if they were told they had an implant, it would scare them which would mean you would start having a negative effect even on working on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I would say even if somebody knew that someone had an implant it would be a hard thing to bring up in a reading.<span>&nbsp; </span>For some reason, this person had done a lot of study of these things, and it didn’t freak them out and so they [the source] said it.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">So the reading was over, and of course this was done on the phone, and then the person had a second reading, and I think over a period of about two months their whole pattern shifted.<span>&nbsp; </span>They stopped, to a great extent, being afraid; they stopped running, so to speak.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems to have created a permanent shift.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was one experience of a few where I learned to tap into this awareness.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Supposedly, four million years ago, there was a group of space travelers which are known as the Annunaki and had come to Earth to mine gold.<span>&nbsp; </span>They decided that they really didn’t like the hard labor of mining gold, and that they were going to create a creature that could work for them who could do the mining and so they actually genetically engineered, these guys were very sharp, and they were able to genetically engineer a human.<span>&nbsp; </span>They had engineered these first humans to only have two strands of DNA open because the idea is that people that have more strands of DNA open, and more chakras open is another way of saying it, than someone else – can usually have a certain degree of power over the people who have a lesser degree of chakra opening, or DNA opening.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Kennedy, as our President, Gandhi.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then in the negative, we probably have somebody like a Hitler, who could also take a lot of control over a lot of people, and his DNA would have been at some notch higher than the people who he was controlling.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">So they got the idea of creating a hybrid; a hybrid would be a human-gray combination, DNA-wise and that the hybrids could continue on Earth.<span>&nbsp; </span>Apparently, there was some agreement from higher forces for this to occur so that this race wouldn’t die off.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the reasons abductions occur is for this hybreeding.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I was first studying David Wilcock’s channelings, this was actually addressed in one of his channelings and we used that channeling, in the book [<i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce?]</i>, and I decided to edit this out, because I said it’s going to freak people out to hear about this.</span></p>
