Now we just came back from Phoenix and I know I am<br />tired and Terry is tired. I have a lot of healing questions<br />and I know that can take a lot of energy, just be honest if<br />you feel like your energy is moving out of the zone just let<br />me know, ok?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Terry:</strong> OK.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn</strong>: When we do healing stuff, this is all very experimental<br />and we never know if it's going to work or how it works and I<br />wish it worked for everyone. If there is any advice given,<br />please run it by your health professionals in terms of<br />supplements,&nbsp; and we are not health professionals here, and we<br />are talking to those in other dimensions.&nbsp; So for the purpose of<br />any legal issues this is entertainment, and you have to draw<br />your own conclusions about anything said here. Something is<br />fairly well known in metaphysical circles is the ability for<br />energy to heal you and that each of us is a energy body and<br />it's a multi-dimensional body within a physical body and<br />healing can come when you can receive energy from an outside<br />source. Sometimes it seems like magic because we are dealing<br />with these Sources that are so enormous but we are the<br />intermediates here and it's very important to understand this<br />process, that the more you can start off with your mind and<br />think about it in your mind, because there is a great tendency<br />to give up one's power in this realm. We start off giving up<br />our power to our parents, well I guess that's ok because we<br />are children. Then we give up our power to our schools and our<br />teachers and then we give up our power to the government, like<br />someone is going to take care of us and I have learned that<br />it's far better to assume power. When we deal with Sources<br />like the Elohim and Ra Group we are not meant to give up our<br />power. In fact if you have the predisposition to want to give<br />up your power to them, probably nothing will happen, because<br />this has to be co-creative.<br /><br /><br />So on that note, I am going to go through our questions but<br />first I am going to call in the light, and calling in the<br />light is just a way of evoking the energy.<br /><br /><br />(Wynn calls in the light)<br /><br /><br />Do we have any introductory remarks through Terry, before we<br />start asking questions?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite<br />Creator. This is Ra'An. It is the 10th of August, 2011, planet<br />earth and we welcome and honor the connection between each and<br />every one of you and ourselves: The Elohim and elements of the<br />Ra Group. We are available to answer your questions.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />Before we answer the health questions we have a few other<br />questions. This one is from Gary in Redondo Beach who says,<br />Steven Hawkins and someone else has a book coming out called<br />“God Didn't Create the Universe, Physics Did.” or something<br />close to that and of course I named our book “The Creator gods<br />of The Physical Universe want to Talk With You.”<br /><br />So I would say that when this realm was created it was created<br />with it's own self perpetuating laws, so it took an intention<br />to start things and then it was designed that it could<br />perpetuate within it's own laws. So if you are looking at the<br />way things work, it seems to me that you can look at the<br />perpetuation of the way things interact and maybe you can see<br />Darwin's theory of evolution because that may be one of the<br />things within the evolutionary track of this realm. There was<br />an intention to create persistence where prior to anything<br />physical there was not persistence, there was just here this<br />moment and as soon as the intention dropped it was gone, so<br />that is my comment on Gary's question.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We wish to make a comment because it is a very<br />interesting question. The impetus for the creation of the<br />universe was from the creator gods. It was an actual impetus<br />from an actual group of entities that were working in<br />sychronization to create something and they didn't know<br />exactly what they would end up with but they were amazed that<br />some of the phenomenon they were able to generate. Within the<br />original generation, it set up as they call it, the mechanics,<br />so that the mechanics of the universe were inherent in the<br />original creation, therefore it looks like it wasn't generated<br />from actual intelligence but it looks like it was just the<br />result of the mechanics of the universe and how it works. Does<br />that make sense?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn</strong>: Yes.<br /><br />It's like even when we make a request on our Sunday grid<br />healing, often times something happens and it just looks like<br />coincidence or circumstances so it's hard to pin it on you and<br />I think that is by intention.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> This is a delightful trend of conversation, as we are<br />able to work with the nature of the universe because we are<br />outside of the universe. We work with the laws of the universe<br />and we have some control over the result. We have a toolbox we<br />can use to make certain adjustments to the physical universe<br />and we cannot violate free will in doing that. When it is the<br />will of the individual we can make interventions when it is<br />for the highest good. So it looks like it is not created but<br />just a coincidence but there are reasons for coincidences.<br />That is our comment.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />Now we have a great follow up question that came in today and<br />for those of you who were listening to the Sunday calls, we<br />were kind of recommending storing some canned food, not fear<br />based but for the same reason you have insurance just in case<br />something happens. Those people who studied the Bible know<br />that in the Bible there were times when Jesus suddenly brought<br />forth fish and wine when it was needed and the question came in,<br />that if we really run out of food, might that not happen again<br />so that people could eat?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We would need an individual within the 3rd density<br />realm that was able to hold up the anchoring end of the<br />manifestation as it takes preparation and forethought in order<br />to manifest such food.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> So we need some more training down here huh?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An</strong>: It is practically beyond training. It is a letting go<br />and an ability to move between realms.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn</strong>: Thank you. That is a really great answer.<br /><br /><br />The next question is from Karen and it is a health related<br />question. She has chronic pain and there are very few days she<br />is pain free. Do you have any suggestions for her? I am going<br />to mute everyone and then I would like you to push *6 and say<br />hello.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Karen:</strong> I am from Louisville, Kentucky. The fibro started about<br />15 years ago. It is in my muscles and I have to take blood<br />thinners.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We greet you with love light. We see that there was a<br />passing down of a condition to you in the family tree. We see<br />that optimum nutrition can help to some small degree, things<br />like getting enough omega 3 and 6 oil, cutting out of canola<br />oil, cutting out of any sucralose or artificial sweeteners,<br />but nutrition is not the final answer. We are looking at a<br />factor in the blood that is misshapen and therefore not free<br />flowing. As this is not free flowing, it then not only in the<br />bloodstream but in the body itself; the give and take of<br />nutrients to cells as a hitch in the transfer of fluids. This<br />creates a lack of free flowing energy within the whole body.<br />There is a resultant misalignment of electrical charge within<br />the body. We will continue to look at this with your<br />permission and will send energy to misaligned areas which are<br />very much through the blood that is misshapen. To look at<br />karmic factors, we remind you that you are not the body and<br />you have within your astral body a perfectly formed astral<br />body that can regenerate a new body, if not in this earthly<br />body now, in a future time. Those are our comments and we<br />again send you love light and greetings and love.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />Somebody asked about some of the answers you have given in the<br />past, you mention electrical potentials as being out of<br />balance. What do you mean by electrical potentials being out<br />of balance?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you<br /><br />There are electrical potentials which are differentials in<br />charge within an area of the body like a battery has a<br />differential in potential between the plus and minus terminals<br />and in the area of the cellular structure, there maintains<br />positive and negative charge that work together. For instance,<br />in electrons, there is a positive nucleus and then a negative<br />surrounding. If the negative surrounding, loses too many<br />electrons and becomes positive, the operation internally in an<br />organ cannot make the proper exchanges between positive and<br />negative and this lends it towards an acidic situation wherein<br />there cannot be proper exchanges of fluids, of nutrients, of<br />energy transfer within an organ. This being the case, bacteria<br />can overrun the area creating sort of a mess therein the<br />cellular structure can no longer work properly and it looks<br />like the cellular structure has broken down and there is an<br />autoimmune response were it looks like the body starts<br />attacking itself, however that is not the situation. The<br />situation is that the electrical potentials within the organ<br />has stopped functioning properly and allowed them to be<br />overrun by negative bacteria, we don't mean charge in that<br />case, we mean destructive bacteria which destroys the function<br />of the organ.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />We have a request from Ron who is in Missouri. He says he has<br />had an off and on situation with an intense lower back pain. I<br />have treated it in the past as if it was pancreatic issues<br />using natural means such as diet and castor oil packs and<br />spiritual methods like calling on elders for the laying on of<br />hands. All of these things have worked well in the past, but<br />it seems that if I slip back in the old ways, this thorn in my<br />side rears it's ugly head and reminds me that I am not allowed<br />to stray off the path in the least. I am apparently missing<br />something here and would really like to be rid of this thing<br />or at least to know what I am doing wrong. Any advice or<br />actual healing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Yours<br />in Christ, Ron<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We see an anomaly in the area of the lower spine which<br />causes friction and pain and when you put castor oil packs it<br />subdues the friction. We suggest that you take a look at your<br />acidity/alkaline balance in that there may be an imbalance in<br />your absorption of calcium. If you would start a program in<br />the morning with calcium, aloe vera and cod liver oil, this<br />will help to put your PH back in proper balance. You can find<br />more about this program by contacting Dr. Marshall at his<br />clinic. The telephone number is 310 320 1132 in Santa Monica<br />but there is further here. It has been a long term in growing,<br />a long term imbalance which has created the anomaly and we<br />suggest that you keep up with what works and you may want to<br />get an imaging of the are and you may want to get a doctor who<br />knows this area and is an expert but will not simply put you<br />on a medication. You have a good sense of what will work here.<br />Those are our comments.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />We have Vicki Burt asks for healing for her daughter Joanna's<br />eating disorder and co -dependent behaviors and of course they<br />tell us it is important normally for the person to ask but if<br />you have any comments for Vicki I am sure she would be very<br />appreciative.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />From your stand point, you can give your daughter a lot of<br />caring and a lot of love and help to ease her fears and help<br />her feel safe and cared for. As far as her own impetus towards<br />her eating disorder, that will be her growth area to deal<br />with. We feel though that making her feel cared for and loved<br />would take off some of the pressure of the eating disorder.<br />There are other factors that are beyond your control, so be<br />observant on ways that you can help her day by day by<br />listening to her and getting her to talk about it and getting<br />her to talk about her relationship with her peers would also<br />shed some light upon this. Those are our comments.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> This is from LaVonne in Long Beach. She says: Can you<br />please put forward a healing request for my ears. I have been<br />dealing with pressure behind the ears, especially the right<br />ear after I had an ear infection in March. Is there something<br />of a holistic manner I can do that will assist in re-balancing<br />the energy pressure behind the ear. I have need to fly for<br />work in a little over a week and then there are back to back<br />trips so any assistance would be received with gratitude.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We would suggest that you be sure to get more liquids<br />that you can flush more of the residue of the infection out of<br />the area. To get a vaporizer and make a mist in the air and to<br />place moist heat behind the ear. To get some very good<br />pro-biotic and to take a pro-biotic and to take a derivative<br />of garlic in capsule form. Dr. Marshall does have in capsule<br />form an immune builder that builds immunity. There is another<br />capsule that can help to dissolve infection so we suggest that<br />you get these capsules and begin to take them in a protocol<br />they can give you to eliminate any infection left in the site<br />behind your ear. Those are our comments.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />We had a question someone had asked about why there is a<br />series of underground tunnels in Bavaria?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> They have been there a while and they have been there<br />for different purposes by those who discovered them. We<br />originally see that they have been there for an underground<br />activity. We look back to the men making these and natural<br />tunnels were enhanced and began to be used by individuals who<br />were the poor. Those are our comments.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />I am just going to put this in the light. This is from Linda<br />and her daughter is having an operation on her back to correct<br />the first back surgery on August 21 of this year and it will<br />be an eight hour surgery. They did a fusion the first time on<br />L5 and it failed. We got a second opinion which was different<br />from the original doctors who have removed themselves from he<br />case. We pray for the new neurosurgeon and is world renowned.<br />She has been disabled for five years and we are praying for a<br />miracle. I am her caretaker and I am usually tied up during<br />these calls but listen to the calls when I can. I think you<br />guys are wonderful, and I appreciate anything you can do.<br />Thank you very much.<br /><br />So we just make a request for help and support on that<br />operation in August.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes, we send love light to the surgeon and to the girl<br />for the best outcome possible.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />On that note, we will bring this call an end. If you ask a<br />question tonight, if I did not ask it, if you could ask it<br />again. It is better to be on line when you ask healing<br />question.<br /><br /><br />Thank you everyone and keep in mind we are giving away our<br />free book, <i>The Creator gods of the Physical Universe Want To</i><br /><i>Talk to You.</i> Go to the website<a href="http://www.creatorgodbook.com%20"> www.creatorgodbook.com </a>and pass<br />it around.
