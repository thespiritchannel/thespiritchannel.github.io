We have what I think will be another extraordinary Monday. Some of you are getting hip to the fact that we’re asking questions on these Monday calls that have never been answered before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We’re talking to a Source through Terry that says they created the physical Universe. This Source says they have been around since before there was a physical Universe and they’ve observed what’s happened in the physical universe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">For a few years this was something that just happened privately, between me and the people around me and I really didn’t how to put this out, didn’t know if I was supposed to put it out, didn’t know that we could do this publicly and we would continue to get what I think is the same Source and it would stay uncorrupted. But we’re doing it right here on Mondays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

For many people who keep paying attention to our calls, there have been profound shifts and changes. I would say the changes come, not so much from the information, although the information can be very profound and it can also create ‘aha!’ experiences and it can also create memories. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Or you could be what’s called a wanderer or a star seed; an entity that came from a higher dimension into this realm to help uplift it. You’ve never felt at home here, you’ve felt out of place. Coming into these calls has created a sense of familiarity, of home, of saying, “That sounds right. That sounds like the way it could work.” Keep listening if you’re having that reaction, because for many of you this is a reunion; it seems to be a reunion of our soul families and our physical beings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

It expands you; it makes you more potent in this realm; it makes you more effective and it certainly makes you feel less alienated. One of the things about those people who come in from other realms into this realm is that they tend to feel alienated. They didn’t come here to do the things that other human beings came to do. They came to uplift the vibration in this realm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

All of you listening on BBS, why don’t you just ‘think love’ back to us all? We can’t hear you but we can feel you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It’s contagious, isn’t it? Love is contagious and if enough people could actually feel it, not in an emotional way, not in the wearing of your heart on your sleeve, but as a radiant energy, it would change our planet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It’s kind of seat-of-the-pants, of “What do I want to talk about?” One of the things we’ve had in our series, but it’s not been consecutive, is how humans were created. To me, it’s always fascinating. Believe me, I don’t know the answers to these questions and I don’t pre-ask them. It’s like we’re discovering this together, on the line. In our series of questions about how humans were created, to bring you up to date very quickly:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Some tens of thousands of years ago, there were very advanced gold-miners visiting planet Earth in spaceships. These gold-miners for special reasons, some people say it was to protect their atmosphere of their home planet, some people say it was like a drug that would make them expand, like a psychedelic. They were called “Annunaki” or “Nephilim”. They were descendants of Elohim who had come into this realm and forgotten who they were, at least for long periods of time. They genetically engineered humans, as a by-product of their DNA and ape DNA, to be their slaves to mine gold. The humans that were engineered didn’t stay very loyal to being slaves. In fact, they wanted their freedom. They wanted to see where these guys went in their spaceships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">So the genetically engineered humans tried to take over a spaceship and in so doing, blew it up. Now, there were these councils of these Annunaki-Nephilim beings that were deciding what to do with the humans. There were two ideas. To get rid of them, that this was a genetic catastrophe; and they were creating a race that was going to be against them; and fighting with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There were two brothers who were in this controversy and the brother that wanted to do away with the humans—this is material that I researched, and any one of you could research this on the Internet and you’ll find various points of view, all fascinating—the two brothers were named Enlil and Enki. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There was a Jewish anthropologist, Zechariah Sitchin, who was translating Sumerian tablets. Sumeria was the oldest culture that we know about on this planet with any records, not as old as Atlantis, but there were no records from Atlantis. Sumeria had tablets. On these tablets, Zechariah Sitchen who wrote books about this, found this story of the gold-mining brothers named Enki and Enlil and then many other people have put their two cents in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">So, we asked about that, and Enlil was the brother that wanted to do away with the humans as a failed genetic experiment and Enki was the brother that said, “We want to evolve the humans back into Divinity.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Those of you who have been tracking a lot of our information know that there is a connection between soul evolution and DNA. The first seven strands of DNA roughly connect with the first seven chakras. The first two strands of DNA relate to survival and sex; the locations on the body are the seat of the spine and the genitals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The third strand of DNA relates to the solar plexus, the third chakra, which relates to power. The fourth strand of DNA relates roughly to the heart or compassion. When humans were originally engineered, they were engineered to have two active strands of DNA. Many humans have activated the third strand, the power strand, and some have activated the heart strand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The medical profession considers these extra strands ‘junk DNA’; they don’t know the purpose of them. The DNA strands, as I’ve come to understand, are like cosmic antennae that pick up the Universe. They’re the microcosm of the Universe in our body. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">At the moment we’re born, they take a snapshot of the Universe which is why astrology works; it’s embedded in our DNA. The DNA is like a psychic awareness to everything around it, constantly changing based on the energy fields that it’s in. Also, as we’ve learned, that in this period of time it’s very important to activate the fourth strand of DNA over slightly more than half, which gives you your ticket to graduate this realm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Let’s go back to Enki and Enlil and this conflict between the two brothers, one that wanted to destroy humans and one that wanted to evolve them. The one that wanted to destroy the humans actually made a pretty good show of doing it. You’ll see that a lot of what I share interfaces with the Bible, but in ways that are a little more involved in understanding things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In those days, when somebody channeled and the voice said they were God, everyone believed them. But, they were different voices and they didn’t distinguish between that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">They said, “If a voice is coming through and says it’s God, it must be God”. At one point, the being that wanted to get rid of all the humans and start over, Enlil, according to my understanding, nuked Sodom and Gomorrah; the cities in the Bible that were supposedly nuked by God, not nuked but destroyed; and they [reference to Lot and his family] weren’t supposed to look back or they would turn into salt. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-line-height-alt: 10.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

As you electrically place a boundary around a spatial projection, the part of the All That Is then begins to vibrate within that particular housing, begins to have localized experiences within that particular housing, begins to sense and perceive within that particular housing and experience within that housing and begins to reach out from that housing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

To breed a small lap dog, to breed a small dog that would be in the tradition of the Orient, the Chinese, that would have certain small characteristics and satisfy certain passions, or desires, of the ruling class. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The original purposes or circumstances of many of these species have been lost, the knowledge of why they were developed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I’m still trying to visualize how reincarnation ties in with the idea that a DNA can attract a unique soul from the field. The DNA attracts a unique soul, but then when an individuated energy that’s already been individuated comes into that stream, it now changes the DNA of the being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">There’s obviously the symbiotic relationship between the DNA attracting energy and the energy that comes in, actually changing the DNA that’s doing the attracting.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Then, if we approach it from the other direction where we, as the Elohim, have set into motion spinning housing units known as galaxies, and within the galaxies streams of energy of life are developed into strands and the strands are intertwined and at different frequencies, so they congeal in different layers and they intertwine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">There is intelligence embedded in these strands, in the twisting of the strands, which then are an embodiment of life. These strands then, as their embodiment through life begins to resonate and interact with the cosmos, with the galaxy spin and there is an intelligent energy within the DNA unit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">This DNA then can flow in long cords and create a Fibonacci cycle with nodes that can begin to collect structure around it. And the structure then becomes a housing unit for the life force that has been picked up and focused in the spinning energies by the spinningness and the housing that thus developed and creates a life form. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Then these life forms can be integrated into more complicated housing units. Within the body, the DNA, within the various species pattern forms, can begin to develop and take on the aspects needed by the body for the individual organs and the individual parts of the species. Within the over-all housing of the body, a resonance develops and the synergistic action develops.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">This body can live and can grow and can take on life within a planet’s atmosphere. Then it can eventually develop a rudimentary consciousness that can grow and learn and become a soul. Then other energy entities who are in the ethers, so to speak, working, say with the Elohim, can see such a body functioning and wish to experience this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Say they had never had a body form before and they were spherical and they were intelligent in nature and they came over the body and began to experience the sensations of the body and decided that they would operate through the body and take on the experiences of life in the third dimension. Then they began to change the DNA to their own particular purposes and their own particular intelligences and they then could move from that body upon the body death, say, into another body and then reprogram that body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">So, you have a couple of ways that souls can be formed. One, through the presence of the body functions and the DNA within the body and the other through consciousness that had just come in and been created. Where was <i>that</i> created from?—from a spinningness, from an intention coming in from All That Is, that had decided to become more localized; perhaps very, very big, perhaps the size of a galaxy, or even larger. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Then, within that framework, it had moved into a smaller area or taken on, a certain space or territory, setting up the anchor points for that territory and then had, within that framework or housing that they had now developed or established, and their intelligence, their own unique track of experiential consciousness and then eventually, taken on a body and moved from body to body. Does this make sense?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">&nbsp; This could go on for hours. This is an incredibly deep conversation of understanding the interaction between bodies and energies. What came up while you were talking was: It seems like the Elohim can get pretty detailed in creating a rudimentary body form or housing, but after a while the intelligences in the 3D take over some extent of the evolution of those things through genetic splicing and make it more sophisticated. In other words, the celestial Elohim does not create a complete human functioning body, but they’ve created the building blocks for it and then other intelligences…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sometimes information may bleed through from the conscious mind of the channel. It is possible that a negative source may interfere. Apply your own discernment; take only what resonates and discard the rest. An answer to a question is meant for the person asking the question and you have the privilege of listening in because sometimes you can gain insights from the answer. However, even though the circumstances may be similar, do not merely assume the answer applies to you.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
