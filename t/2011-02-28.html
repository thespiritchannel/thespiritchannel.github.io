<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">An amazing thing about this thing we call the “frequency fence” is that we don’t even know it’s there.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have been so accustomed to living within the confines of the frequency fence, that we all feel like who we are is who we are.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would be as if you’re someone who grew up in a jail and all you ever saw was the jail and the other convicts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe ythey didn’t even have television and you couldn’t know there was an outside world.<span>&nbsp; </span>All you would think of is: that’s what all life was - that jail.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are certain aspects of life in this dimension which are very comparable to that analogy, where we live in a jail.<span>&nbsp; </span>We don’t have bars, we have “frequency fences.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">“Frequency fence” is just one way of saying it.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have closed matrices; we have reality systems; we have consensus reality.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have the belief systems that we were all brought up in.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have the newspapers all projecting a certain view of reality, and the<span>&nbsp; </span>television and we live in that and to us that is what reality is.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you look at it from a higher perspective, you find out that most of those things that we’re paying attention to are jaded.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re convoluted.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you look a little deeper, you find that they’re not convoluted by accident; this is the amazing thing to figure out.<span>&nbsp; </span>If this is the first time you’re hearing this, then just have an open mind – don’t believe it, because you need to do a little research to prove this to yourself.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are convoluted by design.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">There are intelligences that are holding this realm together.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s like if you’re in jail, in a jail there were jail keepers and they did not want you to know you were in a jail.<span>&nbsp; </span>You were born in that jail then you would create a reality system, like “that’s all there is.”<span>&nbsp; </span>You would see those jail keepers - they might look like God because they bring your food, they let you out of your cage, they let you run around and exercise and then put you back in your cage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">There is an element to life in the third dimension that is exactly that [circumstance.] And so we, as humans, are kept in the cage.<span>&nbsp; </span>What is the nature of that cage?<span>&nbsp; </span>Why are we kept here?<span>&nbsp; </span>How do we break free?<span>&nbsp; </span>Many people are breaking free right now.<span>&nbsp; </span>From the point of view of someone in the cage, when people break free, oftentimes they look crazy.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can say, “That person is not free, that person is crazy.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are insane.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can’t do that.<span>&nbsp; </span>They should be doing this.”<span>&nbsp; </span>So this is how perfect the programming is, that when somebody happens to be free, in many cases, they will be identified by us as looking like they’re crazy.<span>&nbsp; </span>In a worst case scenario, they get prejudiced against and sometimes in past epochs of time, they were put away, they were killed, they were beheaded – because, it’s a trick to be in this realm and also break through.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you truly break through, you have to learn how to act normal so you don’t look crazy to other people.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Sometimes in the past, for instance my self - I used to be a writer around the time of the French Revolution.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had a library and I would publish books.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was trying to put forth an attitude of peace between all people, and so I was not looked upon favorably and I was tried and found guilty and had my head chopped off.<span>&nbsp; </span>So sometimes when a person goes out and tells their view, then they can get cross-wise of whoever is in power or trying to get in power, and that makes it very difficult in this realm.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">The interesting thing is if you believe in reincarnation and you get the idea that you have been in jail for many lifetimes in one way or another… actually, many of the people who are listening to these calls who are attracted to this kind of work that we’re doing, came into this realm from other dimensions.<span>&nbsp; </span>They chose and volunteered to come here, because they wanted to wake up the realm; they wanted to release the prisoners.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once they got here, they forgot that that’s why they came and they ended up becoming imprisoned themselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is so tricky and so subtle, because it’s like we have created a psychic interaction, agreements of reality with each other, where we’ve actually agreed to be imprisoned.<span>&nbsp; </span>In most cases, if you’re going to get out of your prison you need to get a signal, an energy, from a bigger place than the reality system that’s imprisoning you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, you just keep recycling in that same reality system.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just knowing about it is not enough; it’s not enough to free you.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s like the positive intelligences in other realms, because I believe we talk to them in these calls, have made many attempts of interacting with this realm to create circumstances that could free us.<span>&nbsp; </span>I guess they have some degree of success and in most cases, the very attempts to free us from our prisons end up getting taken over by the same negative forces that have put us in prison , so we have new names, but we haven’t freed ourselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re just recycling the same stuff.<span>&nbsp; </span>This <span>&nbsp;</span>is a way to say it.</span></p>
