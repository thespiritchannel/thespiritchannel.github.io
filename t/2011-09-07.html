<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transcription<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday, September 7th, 2011<br /> <br /> <br /> This is Wednesday, September 7th and this is Wynn Free and we are<br /> doing our call where we ask questions that you all have<br /> submitted. One of the things about being a host of these events,<br /> is that it does not put me or even Terry above our humanness. We<br /> are all still dealing with human issues. <br /> <br /> We have this consciousness that is talking to us who identifies itself as the<br /> Elohim and the Ra Groups who have been human, at least as far as<br /> the Ra Group is concerned, and that they give us new tools to<br /> add to our humanness; tools that expand us and help us to<br /> understand how things work and help us to participate in bigger<br /> flows than we could have otherwise and resources that we can draw<br /> on.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have conversations with people and they might<br /> say, everything is inside you. God is inside you. I say that is<br /> true, but everything is outside me too. Like when you get into<br /> the Law of One and you move into the space where we are all part<br /> of each other, we move into the space where we are all part of<br /> the Elohim and we are all part of the Oneness in the Creator.</p>
<p>Notice that as soon as I said that the energy changes, and we<br /> start becoming that. So we start moving into that and it's about<br /> becoming friends with the invisible part of yourself. Really<br /> realizing there is no limit on how large that can be, but at the<br /> same time it does not absolve you from being human, of needing to<br /> eat and take care of your body. <br /> <br /> Let's just move into our little calling in of the light, now<br /> <br /> (Wynn calls in the light)<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Do we have our Sources present?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> This is Ra'An. Terry and Wynn Free in Sedona, Arizona and<br /> greeting to every person on the call. We are honored to be here<br /> and to make contact. We give a minute to move into the earth<br /> sphere more fully. Do you have questions?<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Do you have any comments on the conversation we were having<br /> before we started the recording where I was talking about Adam<br /> and Eve in the Garden of Eden and I was making the speculation<br /> that perhaps the indication of eating the apple was not from a<br /> high source but from a lower agenda to keep humans from having<br /> intimacy that would cause them to evolve. <br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> We see that the story has a greater, broader genesis than<br /> a particular incident than that. That one needs to be aware and<br /> have discernment about what is being presented to one. The story<br /> dates back to ancient times. We do not see that it was narrowed<br /> down to sex.</p>
<p>We see that it was of a broader nature to suggest discernment to <br /> individuals, and when an individual got close to another to maintain <br /> their own integrity and their own discernment, so they did not, by <br /> virtue of the fact of attempting to be close and to have good sexual <br /> relations, to enter into an area that caused compromise in other areas <br /> of their life.<br /> <br /> There were feelings in some humans that the space people were<br /> taking advantage of them. They would show up in their space ship<br /> to pick up the gold and they would be well dressed and having fun,<br /> and as some of the workers would load the gold they would sense<br /> the opulence of the space crew and the passengers, and they would<br /> become very angry at their lot in just continually working and<br /> not seeing any of the opulence that they knew they were given<br /> through their work to the people in the space ships picking up<br /> the gold.</p>
<p>Therefore they created such animosity that they attempted to take <br /> over a space ship and commend-ere it, although they had no knowledge <br /> of how the space ship docked and how to release the space ship <br /> from it's docking station and they created a huge explosion of the <br /> space ship on one of it's trips. This created animosity and a set back <br /> as the Annunaki felt they could not work with the earth people any longer.<br /> <br /> They felt that the race had been genetically put together and had<br /> a bad seed. Not all the Annunaki wanted to destroy the earth<br /> people and write them off and start over again. <br /> <br /> The people on earth were particularly bred using creatures that<br /> were on earth, mixed with Annunaki sperm to create earth beings<br /> that were more intelligent, that could survive the extreme<br /> biological diversity in the earth plane, and be able to live in<br /> it's atmosphere.&nbsp; As many of the Annunaki could not live within the<br /> earth atmosphere for long, based upon the high diversity of<br /> biological factors that would give them strange illnesses. <br /> <br /> There were then diversities between the Annunaki and the earth<br /> people and some of them began to attack the earth people, in an<br /> attempt to wipe them out so they could start other means to mine<br /> the gold. It was very devastating to them when their space ship<br /> blew up due to the take over of the earth people, not all of<br /> them, but a group of them who represented the feelings of the<br /> people on earth and the resentment toward the opulent lifestyle<br /> of the visitors. <br /> <br /> There being then nuclear wars that devastated parts of the Mid<br /> East and a blanket came down upon them about what had happened in<br /> their past because it was too awful to deal with.&nbsp; So the survivors<br /> blanked out the history of what had happened and civilization was<br /> left in lock down condition, and did not go very far and succeed.<br /> Stories began about eating forbidden fruit and when you ate<br /> forbidden fruit it led to disaster. That is part of the story. Do<br /> you have comments?<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn</strong>: Yes, During this period of time, I believe we are talking<br /> about 4 million years ago and perhaps into the future. Where was<br /> the Ra Group in their own formulation of themselves. Did they<br /> exist? Where they evolving? Did they play any part in the<br /> connection of earth?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> The Ra Group is not a physical group and they were<br /> checking in and they were available for assistance, but during<br /> that period there was not much reaching from the people towards<br /> the Ra Group.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Were the Ra Group working with other planetary populations<br /> during that period where there was reaching?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Next question. This is a question about something called<br /> Initiation. Many groups throughout history have used that term<br /> where an individual makes a choice to make a greater commitment<br /> to a certain group. That may even apply to baptism as a kind of<br /> initiation. Indian masters who initiate their disciples and<br /> certain negative groups, secret societies who have their<br /> initiation. I would like a general discourse on initiation and<br /> the positive and negative initiation ramifications, and how one<br /> can know if initiation is a positive thing.<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> Generally, initiation in its broader terms are set to<br /> channel a person's responses in a certain area, and their creative<br /> endeavors into an organized unit and there are several things it<br /> can be meant to do. To move the person into a behavior that is<br /> socially acceptable within that group, it can be positive or it<br /> can be negative depending upon the goals or intentions and works<br /> of that group and the creative interactions of that group.</p>
<p>It can be, in cases where the people are vowed to secrecy, it can <br /> be a hindrance to the person who in general is depending upon the<br /> group and the goals and activities of the group, can be a positive <br /> thing or a negative thing.</p>
<p>In cases of, say baptism or the initiation in Egypt, can be an assistance <br /> to the individual that when they stepped into the initiation and the vows <br /> that they could then operate with more freedom and gain more knowledge <br /> than when they were operating inside of the mores of that particular<br /> group. Do you have further questions on that?<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> How can one know when they are taking vows with <br /> something that is positive or negative. What would be an indication <br /> of some type of negative initiation?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> A negative initiation would be where the individual in his<br /> broad spectrum was more confined or restricted from expansion or<br /> growth, or asked to do things not within his own value system, or<br /> when they feel held back or confined. When they did not resonate<br /> with the goals outlined and did not understand the goals they<br /> were asked to operate in.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /> There is a gentleman named Martin in England and he has built<br /> huge groups on Facebook and other social media on the internet.<br /> And he is frustrated because he has learned some of the higher<br /> principles of the dimensional shift, and people find they are not<br /> interested in hearing about it and he asked, how can he do better<br /> in these circumstances to have a greater impact on people?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> Each and every person is in a certain place in time and<br /> space and they have their own particular interest. The majority<br /> of people are not ready for change. It takes a person who is<br /> ready for change. That is one of the things that is happening now<br /> with the economic system and the weather. It makes a person seek<br /> change and brings them into a space where they are willing to<br /> look at a higher purpose, they are willing to change aspects of<br /> their life that they have not been willing to change previously.<br /> They may need to look if there was something more beyond their<br /> current existence. When they see that the things around them are<br /> no longer reliable and are failing, they may then seek to<br /> communicate with others more or to be open to look at the changes<br /> one can make within their own self, such as opening the heart,<br /> which then can bring them within reach of ascension when the time<br /> would come.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn</strong>: Thank you.<br /> Nancy Jones was in a race last Saturday morning and saw many<br /> chemtrails and later she got the flu and she is asking was her<br /> flu connected with exposing herself to something within the<br /> chemtrails?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> The answer is yes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Is there something she can do to diminish the symptoms?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> Building up of the immune system. Working to detoxify the<br /> body, particularly the liver of some of the metals laid down in<br /> chemtrails. Aluminum, barium, and drinking lots of liquids to<br /> flush the system. There are a number of things like echanasia, and<br /> golden seal which can help, which are natural. Oregano is another<br /> one. To have a humidifier to help the system deal with build up<br /> of mucus. Things in general to build the immune system. One of<br /> them in particular is to keep your body alkaline. This is one of<br /> the bigger things a person can do for their body is to keep their<br /> body alkaline. This gives the body more potential to fight off<br /> things such as viruses, influenza which are in the environment.<br /> That is our answer.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> I would imagine that if anyone is experiencing a day where<br /> there is a lot of chemtrails, it would be a good day to spend<br /> less time, and particularly to avoid intense exercise, outside. Is<br /> this true?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes that is true. If you look up into the sky and you see<br /> those white trails in the sky and they do not dissipate and are<br /> not contrails but hang in the air and sometimes you can see the<br /> drift of particles coming from the trails. As it is spread in the<br /> skies, it falls to the earth and you breathe it in if you are<br /> outside. On a day of heavy chemtrails it is best to breathe as<br /> little of it as possible. When you do breathe it, then the body<br /> has to deal with it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you<br /> Howey Tapway asks, when 2012 comes around are we all going to<br /> evolve. Is there a better way of explaining what we can all look<br /> forward to?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you.<br /> 2012 will come and will go and it is an area where the earth is<br /> as it is now in the process of crossing the galactic equator. As<br /> such, the energies are higher from the direct alignment with the<br /> center; the Hunab Ku, the center of the galaxy. The energies<br /> being higher there is more propensity to be clairvoyant. It is<br /> easier because the frequencies have shifted and has sped up.<br /> Everything has sped up and everything has a little more emotion<br /> and as such, individuals can have a little more emotion within<br /> their own psyche. They will be a little more psychic. So it is an<br /> opportunity for awakening and for growth as we move through 2012.<br /> We have been moving into the plane of the galactic equator for a<br /> number of years and it is simply intensifying. In 2012 we will<br /> begin to move out of the equatorial plane of the galaxy. So it is<br /> a time for intense growth. A time when one can see their patterns<br /> more easily and move through their patterns more easily and<br /> outgrown their patterns more easily. It is a time for wondrous<br /> opportunity for growth. <br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /> The last question is from Gary Brownlee. (Wynn speaking; when I <br /> first started having conversations and I was studying David Wilcock <br /> it was said that the earth was moving from 3d to 4d and there would <br /> be a graduation and those beings who had their hearts open would <br /> move to this higher octave earth. Since that time, there has been a<br /> number of people talking about 3d to 4d to 5d and maybe even 6d.<br /> This has to do with different dimensions that represent different<br /> levels of consciousness, so 3d represents roughly speaking the<br /> 3rd chakra and 4d would represent a realm where hearts would be<br /> open and generally more compassion but I think there is also the<br /> negative there because the negative would turn that open love<br /> into self love and narcissism. The negative does not disappear<br /> until 6th d where you move into the Law of One. In the context of<br /> the Law of One, you cannot experience separation; everything is<br /> part of you so there is no room for service to self and service<br /> to other combined because if everything is part of you, service<br /> everything is serving yourself.)<br /> <br /> So this question is having to do with 3d to 4d to 5d and in a<br /> language that a human could understand, is the plan now going to<br /> shift to 4d, or are people going to go to 5d or are things similar<br /> to when we first started questioning about this?<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An:</strong> Things are still the same as when you began asking about<br /> this. There are some people who through their role are able to<br /> move through it clear into 5d or 6d, and the majority of people, if<br /> they open their hearts, will be able to 4d and to move into a<br /> higher frequency; a frequency of love and a frequency of joy.<br /> <br /> There are some individuals who have figured out how to move into<br /> 4d and still be negative. It is through their profound intention and <br /> through their self love that they are able to move into these realms. <br /> How can one avoid them? One can be true to their own heart as <br /> Shakespeare said, if you are true to your own heart then these <br /> individuals have no light upon you, no access to weakness that <br /> can tempt you away. That is a short summary of our answer.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /> That would be our last question for tonight. We now leave space<br /> for closing comments and then we will close this call.<br /> <br /> <strong>Ra'An</strong>: It is a joyous occasion when we come together and we<br /> profoundly appreciate each and every one of you and to appreciate<br /> this opportunity of service.<br /> Adonai<br /> <br /> <strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you</p>
