<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Then, Jane and I were talking about what can be done, or how we would handle it when he died.<span>&nbsp; </span>At first he had kicked us out of the room when we were talking, but later on we were talking in the room and he was pretty unconscious but I sensed that he was hearing everything and I told Jane I thought that he was hearing everything we were saying.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Then when he left his body I had noticed just probably an hour or so before that there was this huge angel that had come and was just checking things out.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was huge because John’s a big man, he’s 6’1”.<span>&nbsp; </span>It <span>&nbsp;</span>was a huge angel with huge wings and it’s like bigger than John.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was just checking things out.<span>&nbsp; </span>After he stopped breathing, Jane said “Do you see the angel?”<span>&nbsp; </span>And I looked and the huge angel was there. So I spotted John and he was out of his body and I said, “Let the angel guide you to the portal for the tunnel of light.”<span>&nbsp; </span>At one point I said “Don’t give the angels any trouble.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I was right with him and so he was in front of me: the angel was first guiding John to the Tunnel of Light, then I was behind John making sure he found it.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we found the portal to the other side, we found it.<span>&nbsp; </span>John followed the angel in and I followed John into the tunnel of light, I wanted to make sure that he made it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">At that point I had to get out of the tunnel of light because I was starting to get disoriented.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I went back out of the tunnel and he went forward.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then Jane and I looked and the connection between John and I and Jane was getting thinner and thinner as he moved on in the tunnel of light. [Crying.] <span>&nbsp;</span>So then he was gone and I went in and we told the nurse and the nurse came in and said we could stay as long as we wanted.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
