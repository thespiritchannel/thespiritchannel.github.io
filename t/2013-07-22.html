So we were talking about how, when you start coming into these calls, when you first hear about it and you know... keep in mind, I don't know how this works.&nbsp; I mean I am learning as I go, just as you are.&nbsp; Where do you find a "Guide Book" to figure this out?&nbsp; There isn't one really.&nbsp; When you first start hearing the Elohim and you think: "Wow, this has got to be good"..."All my problems are going to disappear!"&nbsp; And then shortly thereafter your problems probably get...worse!&nbsp;&nbsp; Because all your "stuff" starts coming up!&nbsp; And you know, the first thing that happens, once you get over the idea that: "Wow, the Elohim...I am going to be saved...the Ra Group, as we are all discovering-no matter how you play it- YOU HAVE TO SAVE YOURSELF!&nbsp; And one of the parts of that process is-LETTING THINGS SURFACE!&nbsp; Letting the GARBAGE SURFACE!&nbsp; Letting those “PATTERNS OF PAST LIVES” that have been really horrible “SURFACE”.&nbsp; Letting PAIN SURFACE!&nbsp; And as it SURFACES...learning how to ACCEPT IT and PROCESS IT.&nbsp;&nbsp; And let it FLOW THROUGH YOU and LET GO OF IT!&nbsp; It's not necessarily a fast process.&nbsp; I mean in terms of the Cosmos its fast, because most of us have had lots of lifetimes!&nbsp; A hundred thousand years in this realm, maybe more.&nbsp; Maybe millions of years-some of us!&nbsp; And how crazy it is, every time you come in, you don't know a thing!&nbsp; It is like starting over...except, all of this "STUFF" that is buried in your track.&nbsp; And so when it starts to come up and SURFACE and you are suffering, or you are going through it, the best attitude is... to just LOOK AT IT and be GRATEFUL FOR IT!&nbsp; "I am so glad this is coming up"..."I am so glad because I am going to work it through" (you might say to yourself).&nbsp; And let it go through and release!&nbsp; That is the fastest way to move through it...no matter what it is.&nbsp; If it is PAIN; SORROW; ANGER; HATRED; you know...it is OK, those things can come up for us.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if you are JUDGING yourself...you are going to not like that "HATRED".&nbsp; But don't JUDGE yourself...just don't "ACT" on it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

It does not have to be like "you are holding it" (ANGER) and at some level the person knows what "they" are doing and they know "they" deserve that (ANGER) so... IT'S NOT BAD.&nbsp; But (on the other hand) its ANGER...like for example: someone did something Karmically to you in another lifetime; and they just always make you ANGRY; and you don't know (that) is why... you are ANGRY.&nbsp; When you start RAGING towards them; that is creating KARMIC PATTERNS.&nbsp; And you know; a month later "you" may have cleared that pattern and (yet) "they" are still holding it.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">&nbsp;</span></p>

People feel the, you know, the errors (since they are) tuned into everybody-and so they will feel things that "you are not Karmically responsible (for)".&nbsp; You can't even help it...and the only thing you can do is "judge yourself" or "accept it".&nbsp; And if you "judge yourself"...now you are stuffing it again...you are putting it back and saying "I can't deal with that"...and then, it never gets worked out.&nbsp; So, the key to WORKING THINGS OUT: is to letting them SURFACE!&nbsp; And if: you have people around you that can understand this process then let them know that; it can "SURFACE STUFF" around them (without them taking it personally)...then "that could be good".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

That is how The Old Testament was developing, and sometimes they would be fighting with each other!&nbsp; Like in the story of Jezebel: there was one of the God forms called "Baal" and then there was "Yahweh".&nbsp; They would fight for control and recognition of the people to see "who was the strongest God"?&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is what our Judeo-Christian background is based on.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

They (the Elohim and Ra SOURCES) told me it was when I asked them.&nbsp; They kept happening and as many of you know, "It" (the ENERGY you can feel), happens on these Conference Calls.&nbsp; Particularly on our Sunday Call.&nbsp; So if you have never listened to a Sunday Call...we emphasize bringing that "ENERGY" in.&nbsp; My idea, from observation, is that they (the SOURCES) are in the background.&nbsp; They pay real attention to us, all the time, on these Calls.&nbsp; They will come in, in a way that can-expand us. They can-clear ENERGIES-out of our body and help us with requests or intentions that cause things to happen!&nbsp; But they are not GOD in the traditional sense.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"He laid her down all alone in Dilmun and the place where Enki had laid down with his spouse (Ninsikila), that place was still virginal, that place was still pristine...he laid her down all alone in Dilmun and that place..." (they repeat themselves (said Wynn) I am&nbsp; not going to repeat it).&nbsp; "In Dilmun (from the translation once again) the raven was not yet cawing, the partridge not cackling. The lion did not slay, the wolf was not carrying off lambs, the dog had not been taught to make kids curl up, the pig had not learned that grain was to be eaten.&nbsp; When a widow has spread malt on the roof the birds did not yet eat that malt up there, the pigeon then did not tuck the head under its wing.&nbsp; No eye-diseases said there: I am the eye disease.&nbsp; No headaches said there: I am the headache.&nbsp; No old women belonging to it said there: I am an old woman.&nbsp; No old man belonging to it said there: I am an old man.&nbsp; No maiden in her unwashed state...in the city.&nbsp; No man dredging a river said there: it is getting dark.&nbsp; No herald made the rounds in his border district.&nbsp; No singer sang an elulam there.&nbsp; No wailings were wailed in the city’s outskirts there.&nbsp; Ninsikila said to her father Enki: you have given a city-what does your giving avail me?&nbsp; You have given a city Dilmun.&nbsp; You have given a city.&nbsp; What does your city avail me?&nbsp; You have given a city that has no river quay (a wharf of stone to load &amp; unload cargo).&nbsp; You have given a city.&nbsp; What does your city avail me?&nbsp; A city that has no fields, glebe or furrow"!&nbsp; (It sounds like she (Ninsikila) is saying: "what are you giving all this stuff to all of the city for"?)&nbsp; Enki answered Ninsikila: "when Utu steps up into heaven fresh waters shall run out of the ground for you from the standing vessels on Ezens shore, from Nannas radiant high temple, from the mouth of the waters running under the ground.&nbsp; May the waters rise up from it into your great basins.&nbsp; May your cities drink water aplenty from them.&nbsp; May Dilmun drink water aplenty from them.&nbsp; May your pools of salt water become pools of fresh water.&nbsp; May your city become an emporium on the quay from the land.&nbsp; May Dilmun become an emporium on the quay from the land.&nbsp; May the land of Tukris hand over to you gold from Harali, lapis lazulli (a blue gem-stone) and may the land of Meluha hold precious desirable carnelian mes of Megan wood and the best abba wood into large ships for you.&nbsp; May the land of Marhasi yield you precious stones,topazes.&nbsp; In the land of ...."&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
