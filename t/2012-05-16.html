<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Hello everybody.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is Wednesday, May 16<sup>th</sup> (2012); this is Wynn Free in Sedona with Terry Brown in Sedona on our conference call live on a Wednesday night where we ask questions that you all have submitted.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We were having a discussion about that new project we’re doing which I sent out with all the videos on UTube.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m going to send it out again, but I think next time I send it out I’m going to send it out in the website format, because all of those videos are going to be on one page all in little thumbnails.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can just look for your issue and click on the right video.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m testing it, but I think it’s a good way, not only for those people who are regularly on the line, but also for people who are discovering us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead of just talking about my wild story or telling them, “You’ve got to read this whole book” they can watch a four-minute little byte and either it reaches them or it doesn’t<span>&nbsp; </span>they can qualify themselves about whether it’s something they’d like to reach further for or not.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We are in the middle of a shift; we’re on the roller-coaster, we’re rocking and rolling.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lucky for us, we have some really good guidance and really good anchoring on this line – I say, “Lucky for all of us.”<span>&nbsp; </span>We have questions for tonight; let me fill myself in.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let me see if there is anything last minute.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you have not availed yourself to ask a question, I highly suggest you do.<span>&nbsp; </span>At some point, we’re going to have way more questions than we can possibly answer.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a pretty good chance, if you ask a reasonable question and even sometimes an unreasonable one, we might ask it.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sometimes there are questions I wouldn’t have asked when we first started doing these calls.<span>&nbsp; </span>I told Terry “…put yourself in my position; you guys know how shy and reserved Terry is” and here we are – live!<span>&nbsp; </span>I said, “I’m going to ask her a question and she’s going to go screaming away, saying, “Oh, no!”<span>&nbsp; </span>Every question will be like, “Go see Dr. Marshall.”<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Or, “I’m not getting anything.”<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Or ‘I’m not getting anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just a moment – I’m not getting anything.’<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ll be back in an hour<b>.<br /><br /></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ll be back in an hour.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, I imagined articles being written all over the world about Terry’s failed public attempt, probably starting with David Wilcock.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Right<b>.<br /><br /></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve come a ways, and we’ve come a ways with the help of many of you; your acknowledgments, many of your thank-yous have made a huge encouragement to continue doing this.<span>&nbsp; </span>Believe it or not, we don’t have to do it.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it’s not working, I wouldn’t do it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t need to spend three nights a week scheduling my time.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m a guy who hates schedules, yet I’m doing this because it’s working.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s because of the emails I get from you that say – even from strangers that I never heard from – that say how much it’s impacted them.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re listening on the calls and you’re new right now, then don’t expect too much; just be neutral.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t think we’re good at meeting people’s expectations; it’s always a surprise.<span>&nbsp; </span>I say, “Where did that come from?” then these beautiful energies come on the line and everyone feels them.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On that note, I’m going to start.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Father Mother God we ask for the presence of the light to surround and protect Terry, myself and everyone on this line and any negativity be taken to the higher realms of light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned.<span>&nbsp; </span>We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the Sun, the Moon, and the outer energy fields of the earth, through our bodies, through the floor and into the center of the earth.<span>&nbsp; </span>Right now, we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls.<span>&nbsp; </span>We invite those sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One to join with us.<span>&nbsp; </span>We create a protected space that only the positive has access to, and anything not of that nature must leave now.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Do we have our sources present to answer our questions for this evening?<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite Creator.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is Ra’An; the 16<sup>th</sup> of May 2012 and we reach and touch and are available for everyone who wishes to connect with our energies.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are there for you and we can be a stabilization in a time when stabilization is so needed, as there are things shifting in the economic system and in people’s lives that uproot the energies.<span>&nbsp; </span>The energies also are increasing due to the position of the earth in the galaxy at this time.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We impart love to each and every one of you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you have questions<b>?<br /><br /></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes, we do.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is from Chase Holden.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s kind of a philosophical question.<span>&nbsp; </span>He asks, “How is our universe based on a holographic principle?<span>&nbsp; </span>Reality can appear differently to different observers, and even different when not observed at all.<span>&nbsp; </span>How is the universe both a shared illusion and a hologram?”<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you have a cup of water and you put some red wine into the cup, then the whole cup turns slightly pink or slightly red, depending upon how much wine you put into the cup.<span>&nbsp; </span>The shared thing, then, is the combination of the two things – the water and the wine.<span>&nbsp; </span>You have then, because water is of a structure that it can receive the wine and can absorb the wine and integrate it, then you have the shared water and wine and the taste becomes slightly like wine.<span>&nbsp; </span>You have also another possibility, and that is when you pour motor oil into a cup of water, and the motor oil floats on the top and is of a different viscosity and so it is separated.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">These are analogies as to how holograms can either merge, depending upon the nature of the people creating the hologram, living in the hologram, or holograms can separate out.<span>&nbsp; </span>As the universe is put together, the third density is like a layer of the water and then the higher densities – for instance, the place where heaven is - is separated by the frequencies.<span>&nbsp; </span>It, too, can have visitations of one realm into the other and heaven can shine upon the earth realm into the hologram of the third density but it does not merge and become one, as there is a separation in frequencies between the two and densities between the two.<span> <br /><br /> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There can be tunnels that connect the two – for instance, the tunnel of light which an individual may transfer from in their transition from the life on earth to the transition into the heavenly realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the tunnel, then, (they) can radiantly, as they move through the tunnel, be released of the frequencies of the earth realm and introduced into the frequencies of the heavenly realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>So they are ready to go into the heavenly realm without being as dense as it is necessary to be in the third density realm.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Does this help with your question<b>?<br /><br /></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>I think so; the second part of the question is:<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">How is it both a shared illusion and a hologram?<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I do believe that people in higher dimensions - beings in higher dimensions - can see into our dimension.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t believe we can see very easily into their dimension.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>In order for a person in the higher dimension to see into the third density dimension, they need to be able to bring in, hone in those frequencies in order to bring them into focus so that they may see them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, if they are simply in the higher dimensions, they do not see into the lower dimensions<b>.<br /><br /></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">“I wish to know if the angels that fell with Lucifer decades ago – I think it was longer than decades – can ever be forgiven?<span>&nbsp; </span>Are they destined to eternity roaming, or is there hope they could ascend again?”<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">That’s the question; you can handle it as you wish.<br /><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">All individuals, the fallen angels included, have acceptance or forgiveness.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whether they forgive themselves or not is another matter, as they become locked into their negative path.<span>&nbsp; </span>It becomes harder for them to escape the negative path.<span>&nbsp; </span>Forgiveness is one of the first steps in helping them to change their path, because it is saying, “Alright, this is the way things are but they don’t have to be this way.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can change how they are.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’re not condemned forever; you have a way out.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can retain your validity in heaven.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can come back; you can be forgiven.<span>&nbsp; </span>For<span>&nbsp; </span>the angel to come back takes the re-organization within their matrix of how they react.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead of reacting with ego or in a negative way, they can reclaim their positivity and their actions for the highest good and put the negative behind them.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can be reclaimed; they can reclaim their position in heaven.<br /><br /></span></p>

He does not trust Ralph; he feels that Ralph – we search for the words - that Ralph is too much of a know-it-all, and he is trying to teach him (Ralph) a lesson and to keep him in prison as a sort of a revenge.<br /><br /></span></p>
