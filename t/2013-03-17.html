This is our Sunday grid healing; thank you all so much for showing up and being part of this work we’re doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I do mean we; it’s a “we-work”. The more I go, the more I understand how that is and how special all of you are for choosing; you have to choose to be here. I just had an interesting situation; I did a live event in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">L.A.</st1:place></st1:city> yesterday and I did it myself. I’m here and Terry is in Sedona and Daphne is in Half Moon Bay. I did the event by myself; I drove all night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I’m doing an event tomorrow and on next Sunday in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place></st1:city>, at a place where I kind of cut my teeth in learning how to talk about this material. There was something called Holistic Living Expos. When <i>The Reincarnation of</i> <i>Edgar Cayce?</i> first came out, I called up the producer of that Expo; his name is Dean Price. He invited me to come to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place></st1:city> and talk on the book. It was all fairly ‘last minute’ and Terry and I drove down. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I believe it might have been my first public talk on <i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce?.</i> This is the event I refer to so often, where, when I was talking there was all this energy in the room. People were leaving the room to go buy the book and saying they could see auras. I kept saying to myself, “What is that?” That’s when I asked them and they said they were helping me when I showed up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So we did a couple more events at this guy’s Expos; they were all over <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:state>; <st1:place w:st="on">Northern California</st1:place>, <st1:place w:st="on">Southern California</st1:place>. I would drive to the Expos, sometimes sleep in my car. Usually we didn’t sell enough books to make it pay for itself, or to make a profit or even to make it pay for itself and break even. At a certain point, I did a talk in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pasadena</st1:place></st1:city> at &nbsp;Roy Gibbons, who was doing a weekly dinner in the <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pasadena</st1:place></st1:city> area and I was going to talk about the book. This had to be in 2004 when the book first came out. I was going to talk about <i>The Reincarnation of</i> <i>Edgar Cayce?.</i> I was talking to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:city> on the phone and I was telling him about what had happened to me personally. <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:city> said, “You’ve got to talk about that! You’ve got to tell your story.” I said, “No, I can’t really talk about that, no. I mean, I want to talk about the book.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Finally he convinced me and I went and told the story for the first time publicly of what had happened with me with Daphne and Terry. It was okay; no one threw tomatoes; no one hated me. I continued to go around and do talks. It’s very interesting, because at that particular time, it seemed like the only way to get this out into the world was to do public talks. How else do you reach people?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So that was my focus: to go out and talk. Every time that energy would be in the room. Some of you are here today perhaps, because you went to one of those talks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So I learned to talk about this material doing those Expos. I had no idea initially how to talk about it and how people were going to respond. It was all kind of scary. “What are people going to say? Are they going to think I’m anti-Christian?” But I did it. Then I didn’t do any of Dean’s Expos for a very long time. I decided to do it; he was doing an Expo in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Carlsbad</st1:place></st1:city> in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place></st1:city>. We did Dean’s Expo and it’s today, which means I’ve got to drive down to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place></st1:city> after I check out of this motel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Then I added on a talk in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:city> at the last minute. There’s a community spiritual center here in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">L.A.</st1:place></st1:city> called ‘Gateway’. The fellow that has it has been suggesting that I talk there for quite some time. So I called him and I said, “Do you have a space for me?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">In any case, it was very interesting to do a live talk. One of the things that I’ve learned from the time that I first did talks and I thought that was the way to get things out there, was the difference between being entertaining and making a profound contribution to someone. Part of me knows how to be entertaining. Being entertaining is fairly easy because as long as you keep people smiling and making them laugh, you feel safe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">When you stop being entertaining and you go into this area where there’s sacredness, where there’s a lot of personal vulnerability, it’s more scary. You’re not getting feedback; when you’re getting feedback you know people love you. When you’re not getting feedback, in other words, they’re not laughing; they’re not smiling. When you’re not getting that kind of feedback and you go into that area, it’s like: “What are they thinking of me?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">But it’s in that area where there’s no feedback, visually or any way, that you make the biggest difference. I was very tired yesterday and I didn’t think I did a good job; I looked at it and I said, “I think I was too relying on being entertaining.” You know you can tell; I can tell if I did a good job, because if I did a really good job there will be people coming into the calls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">To me the purpose of doing a public talk is not to be entertaining, perhaps to be enlightening; there are certain things I can share which are enlightening, that are things people never heard before. But most of all, I want to give people an opportunity. As many of you have learned, the work we’re doing is a phenomenal opportunity to switch your energy, to feel connected and to have a fellowship with people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So many people need that, but they don’t know they need that. I think particularly in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>, if anyone is listening now who was at the <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">L.A.</st1:place></st1:city> meeting, I’m probably not talking about you personally, but just in general; in many places, people are just striving all the time, particularly in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">L.A.</st1:place></st1:city><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">L.A.</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"> is built to make people strive; they have to become successful. They have to be something, someone. If you don’t fit into that mold, then you feel like a failure; you feel out of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We had an <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">L.A.</st1:place></st1:city> audience last minute and I was too funny I guess. I mean I told the story; I did everything. Also, I tried something new. We had a full-production show with me sitting there. Carla came and said hello to everybody; Daphne did; Terry did; we did a session. Maybe it was really good; maybe I was just too tired to know that it was good. As it got close to the end of the four hours, I started falling asleep while I was looking at people and that’s not a good sign for doing a good event.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We’ll see how I do today. The work that I do over the phone has evolved so much from doing the events years ago, which I thought was the way to go. In fact, Francis, who is on the line, actually went to one of Dean’s Expos in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Concord</st1:place></st1:city> where she lives. I don’t think he’s doing the one in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Concord</st1:place></st1:city> anymore. I see in today’s world how when you start doing things in the public and thinking of the public it can become such a distraction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Years ago, when I first met David Wilcock, I had a reading from David. At that time, he was not representing himself anything like he is now and he was doing readings. I was testing him out. I wanted to see if I really wanted to write this book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">There were a couple of things in the reading that came up that were really quite amazing and perceptive. I knew that it wasn’t David giving me that information. One of the things that came up was they talked about me being on a stage and that when the show was over the show wasn’t really over. Up to that point, I always thought of myself as entertaining: going up playing music, going up giving a lecture, whatever. When you were finished, you were onto the next thing. They were saying that was not really the way it worked for me. I knew what they were suggesting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It was like when you’re operating in The Law of One, nothing is ever over, okay? How do we say this? When we talk to you, when we open our hearts to each other, you never go away. You’re always there. I don’t even know you, some of you. Yet, you’re inside me energetically and I’m inside you energetically, not by any force, just on a free will connection because love, if it’s real love, it stays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If you note, oftentimes the Elohim will end a call saying, “We leave but we do not leave”. “We leave, but we do not leave.” What a profound statement. Which means, once you love somebody in a spiritual way, once you love somebody in The Law of One, once that occurs, if it’s happening like that; they never go away; they’re always part of you. I don’t know if you could make a choice about it. Unless, of course, they betray the love or you betray the love and that separates the energies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It becomes something you can feel inside you. It’s a very sacred thing to occur, very sacred, to allow someone to live inside you and you to live in them as a loving energy and on some level, it’s something we all long for; we feel lonely. We look for things out in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Of course, we look for someone out in the world. Most of us have the experience of being in a very loving, romantic relationship. When the relationship ends, you never talk to the person again; they’re history. That was not the Law of One; that was human love, as if you could possess someone. When they’re gone, they’re gone. It’s not like having someone live inside you as a loving energy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Now the good news is that it’s a wonderful experience. The bad news is, if you have patterns that are working on older levels, it’s very hard to go back to those patterns once you have that experience of loving someone in the context of The Law of One, where they never go away. This is like it’s not easy to model; I don’t know if I’m saying this in the clearest way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Let me go a little step further and say that when I say they never go away, it doesn’t mean that you’re haunted by them. It doesn’t mean that they’re preoccupying your mind. It means that their frequency and your frequency are available to each other. Let me see if I can get this right; I’m speculating here, I never thought about this before’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I never said it in these words, so I might get it wrong, but let me see: it’s as if on the other side level, that when people make a Law of One affiliation their frequencies cross, so suddenly you both have new frequencies added to your reservoir. As you love people, there’s new frequencies added. The Elohim and the Ra group have frequencies added to your reservoir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">What’s a reservoir? It’s a holding-tank for water. Now there are these frequencies that are being held in your tank out of free will. What happens is, the reservoir, as it gets strong, gets to be shared by more than one person. In fact, those of you on this line and I and Terry and Daphne, we are actually building a reservoir that’s holding energies in it. Each of us is contributing our frequencies to those energies so the reservoir becomes a stable point that you can access for your own nourishment and fulfillment. We’re creating it as a team.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">As long as there’s a certain amount of people holding that space, if you happen to get weak, you can go back to that reservoir and tap into it and it pulls you out of it. It becomes a stable creation that didn’t exist except for the fact that we’re creating it. This is what the Ra group meant when they gave me that reading through David Wilcock, that when you’re off the stage you’re not really off the stage. They didn’t use these words, but there’s still the reservoir and the reservoir stays, regardless of whether people are paying attention to you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You don’t have to spend a lot of time; this reservoir creates itself as a natural outcome of the work we’re doing. I’ve never put it into these words before, but I never thought about in these terms exactly. But I’m sharing it because I did a public event yesterday. On some level, it felt like I failed. It felt like I was going back to an old pattern of entertaining. Well, you do have to entertain people at a live event.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You people are coming, hitting the ground running, many of you. You’re already building the reservoir, even though you never thought about it in those terms before, you get it when I say it and it makes sense. You go to a new crowd, particularly in a New Age crowd and they want an experience right away. They expect that. I can’t just avoid that expectation, because I have to get people’s attention and interest before I can move on. I have to make myself credible; it’s good if they like me and I seem like a pleasant guy and then go on from there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I suppose because I was tired yesterday, I stayed too much in the entertainment mode and didn’t move into the next step strong enough. I did the best I could. But, it was just interesting to observe it; to observe the process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I am sure I am like a model of everyone; what I go through is just another thing that you go through in a different way, of course. You’re not giving public talks, but you do have relationships. Can you identify your relationships in such a way that you can see the ones that live inside you and the ones that are entertainment? I’m sure if you think about it you’ll see not everyone is lucky enough to have people that live inside them that have that kind of loving energy with another person. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Don’t judge yourself if you don’t have that; create it as a model or a vision. If you’re on this line and you keep coming into this line, you’re having it with us, even if we don’t know you. You don’t have to know somebody to have them live inside you. It just has to be unconditional love, total free will, The Law of One. Right now, as I’m talking, there’s an energy moving that you can feel. Many of you can feel it and that is us; we’re living inside each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">When you get this idea of the Law of One and living inside another being—I don’t know if I’m using the right terminology, saying ‘living inside’, because somebody might think that’s an attachment or an invasion. “I don’t want anything inside me.” As long there’s still free will there’s no invasion. Everybody likes company; everybody likes fellowship, camaraderie; most people do. This is like ‘company’ to the next level; finding that when you love somebody and you’re in the experience of The Law of One, it just never goes away; it stays. You start building a reservoir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It’s a good thing I don’t prepare this conversation; I don’t know where I’m going to go. I’m always totally amazed. If you look at some of Jesus’ words, we’re talking about the kind of stuff Jesus talked about, but he said it in the language of the time: ‘The Father and I are one’. What does it mean to be one? It means ‘To live inside you.’ “When two or more are gathered.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I don’t know if that implies this idea, I’d have to go through it, but I am sure there are many statements from the Bible which talk about this. It seems to me that we are developing it as a group right here. We are learning it; I am learning it; Terry’s learning it; we are learning how to have unconditional love, love that never goes away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Once you start building these reservoirs with love, you are totally changing the Universe. Everything is changing, because it never goes away; it’s permanent. I don’t think it ever goes away. I think it lasts until you die and then it probably still goes on. It’s probably what says, “Hey guys, we’re a team now. Let’s go build a solar system. Let’s go do this.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I’ll throw this idea out there; this idea has occurred to me in the past. If you take the way the Elohim has described the way creation started, they talked about a number of Elohim souls, all focusing on something. That created the beginning of the physical Universe. Here we are, in the physical Universe, all focusing on something. I’m suggesting that combination of energy comes and starts to create a permanent change in the Universe. Many of you are noticing these things that we call the negative, which are real, are not on top of you. You’re not as impacted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Daphne said something that was profound in a conversation a couple of weeks ago:&nbsp; “You either have to create or be created upon.” In other words, if you’re kind of passive and inert and you expect something to change, it doesn’t. There are lots of energies all around you that have intentions and many of them are negative. If you’re in an inert, kind of neutral, passive state those energies will work on you; they will impact you and you’ll feel at the effect of them. You’ll feel that you’re being controlled by the negative. The next step is to get rebellious and say, “Get out of here!” Then you’re stuck, because you have to create your way out of it. How do you do that? You have to figure it out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Creation comes from volitional action; I’ve made many suggestions in the course of these calls, everything from going to old age homes to calling your aunts and uncles up who are dying, God knows what. There are many things to do to create your way out of the situation. As you create, you bring in new energies and new possibilities of volitional action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">As you are passive, you allow things to work on you. Oftentimes, you’ll end up where you wish you weren’t, or with people that you wished you weren’t with, because they’re creating their thing on you and you’re just flexible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Why do we have what’s called the sheeple? Why are the great masses of people so ignorant of what’s going on? There are so many negative agendas going on and most people are clueless, because they’re being created upon. They’re watching television; they’re reading the newspapers. The people around them are all laying trips on them and they’re just like sticky-paper; everything sticks and they can’t move it through it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You have to create your way out of that if you’re feeling those kinds of things; if you’re feeling that you have no freedom, you can’t do anything and everything is affecting you, then you have to find the point of volitional action that you can take to throw yourself through that. It’s going to be different for everyone, so you can’t say, “What should I do?” Do anything, experiment. Experimenting is a great way to move through things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Every time you do an experiment you don’t know how it’s going to turn out. Don’t risk more than you can lose, but take the risks and be willing to lose something. I came to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">L.A.</st1:place></st1:city> and it was a risk. I look at it: first of all, I didn’t have many people come to the workshop; we probably had about fourteen. That was not enough to cover the expenses, at least up till now; who knows what’ll happen in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place></st1:city>, but we’ll see. We’ll see when we get there; I’m willing to have nobody show up, because I haven’t been focusing on a public presence for quite some time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Although I was on George Noory; that was a big public presence. Many of you heard me. There is a value in the right public presence, to having new people exposed. It gives them a chance to explore all this work we’re doing and make a connection with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The risk was; we came here and spent money, spent gas. I’m in a motel and not enough people came to pay the expenses. But we could afford that, not largely, but barely. At other times if we had an event like this and we lost money we wouldn’t be eating for a week, or it would affect survival. So we could afford it; it was a risk. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You never know how it’s going to happen. Maybe I’ll show up in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place></st1:city> today and there’ll be a hundred people or fifty people or thirty people, maybe enough to cover the expenses and then cover the expenses of this trip. If there’s not, then we’re still surviving; we didn’t risk more than we could lose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You have to take risks sometimes when you’re doing volitional action to see where it goes. There was a fellow who wrote a motivational book in the ‘70’s; his name was Robert Ringer. He had something in one of his books that really impacted me; it was a long time ago. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Let me see if I can remember it now; I know the idea of it. The path of acquisition has to do with the formation of a negative postulate. I’ll explain what that means; you probably didn’t get it the first time; I didn’t get it the first time so don’t feel bad. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If you want something, that’s acquisition. Mostly he was talking about motivation and making money. If you want to make money, especially if you’re in sales, let’s suppose you need a job. Let’s suppose you’re one of those people who need a job. In normal motivational thinking you’d say, “I’m going for an interview today. I’m going to get the job; this is going to be my job.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You pump yourself up and you’re going to make a good impression and you go out and you don’t get the job. Now you have to go lick your wounds and recover from all that energy that was so sure it was going to get this job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">What this guy Robert Ringer said is, most things don’t happen; that’s just the way it goes. The chances are you’re not going to get the job. But statistically, if you go for a hundred interviews you will get a job. The problem is you pumped yourself up so much for this interview that you have to recoup because you feel rejected now; you took it personally. You have recoup for a period of time until you go to the next interview.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If you had told yourself, “I’m probably not going to get this job, but this is one step closer to getting a job because I’m going to go to a hundred interviews. By the time I do a hundred interviews I’ll probably have a job”. Then you could have done a hundred interviews and not blown so much energy by getting your anticipation up and convincing yourself this was going to be the job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">In a sense, if I’m going out and doing public talks and I keep doing them, there’s always some success in a public talk. There’s always somebody that’s going to be reached one way or another. When I was on my way driving here I stopped at a truck stop, and I ended up having the waitress sit next to me and the trucker next to me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I reached those people; we had a phenomenal conversation, unexpected people that I would connect with. The waitress came from a Catholic background and I showed her the picture of Terry and she was quite amazed. They’ll probably both be on our calls sooner or later; you never know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Nonetheless, even willing not to worry about whether I made money, but if I did a hundred talks it would have to be successful. It would build the energy. I would end up meeting people in the audience that wanted to give some kind of support to this work that would find it important. But I have to be able to afford to not make money.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">At one point <i>The Reincarnation</i> <i>of Edgar Cayce? </i>came out; I would go give talks. There’s a nuts &amp; bolts mechanics to all of this that’s not so obvious. I was doing talks and I would go to a bookstore and I’d do …<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:&nbsp; You’re cutting out Wynn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:&nbsp; He’s cut out now. My phone cut out a minute ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Last night I stayed up all night doing transcripts; I really got into a zone. I edited about five or six transcripts. I was just amazed by some of the material in the transcripts. It’s really important material; we’re getting them up on <i><span style="color: #0070c0;">thespiritchannel.net</span></i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I think it’s going to be a good channeling on the call today. I’m getting stuff; they often play off the things that Wynn was talking about. Some of the stuff is pretty interesting, about connecting up with the Sources and then building an energy reservoir and then it can stay with one. Just to know that they’re there and just to know that you’re really connected. The frequencies are there whether you dip into them or not; the frequencies are loving; the energy-beings are loving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I wanted to ask a question, Gijs. I’ve noticed that I’m doing all these transcripts and when I do them, the border of my computer is turning light pink. Light pink is the color of the Sources when they come in. I wondered if you’ve ever had that happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:&nbsp; No, I have not noticed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:&nbsp; I’m back! How long was I gone?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:&nbsp; About five minutes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:&nbsp; Five minutes and I was just getting to the good part of everything and I forgot it all. I kept talking away; I’m back on Skype. I’m stuck between Skype, my computer power that goes off and my cell phone that doesn’t have good reception in downtown <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>. We will just continue; I’m staying very still so my computer stays on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I share this because those of you who are listening, when we do this and it works it looks so smooth; we look slick. It looks like we have it down and we don’t. This is like a mom and pop corner store and behind the scenes there’s all this scurrying about to make it work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Also, because we have discovered that we can live inside of each other and suddenly, there’s a responsibility. As soon as you let someone live inside you, as soon as you let yourself love someone in that way, you have a certain responsibility for them. There’s a limit to how responsible you can be for another person, no matter how much you like them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">One of the problems is: you let people live inside you and then they’re having problems, like they can’t pay their bills, their house has been foreclosed. I mean, I start feeling, “I want to get them out of that problem; I can feel their pain”. I’m helpless; I don’t know how to do it. I have to let that go; I have to let it go so that I don’t block my greater work by being worried about them. It just has to go; it’s just their body. It’s just this life; they’re going to be back again and again. But the loving of living inside people doesn’t end with life; that goes on and on and on. That’s The Law of One; it’s eternal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Gijs, I was explaining that thing about the formation of the negative postulate to get a positive outcome. Do you remember?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:&nbsp; Yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:&nbsp; Did I complete that? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">: Yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"> I did, okay. I just wanted to not leave that hanging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The idea is, if you want something to happen, don’t pump your energy up on each little opportunity and say, “This is going to be the one”. Be wise and say to yourself that most things don’t happen and keep going. If you do enough things you’ll get it; that’s the idea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">For us to figure out how to connect with people and do what we’re doing now it took, let’s see. 2002, I started writing the book and having the experience with Daphne. It probably took from 2002 to 2009 of trying different things. Also learning all this stuff, so we could actually do what we’re doing now and say, “This is working”; but it took a lot of trial and error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:&nbsp; In any case, let me go to our healing list. This talk today may be an explanation of how some of this stuff, when you first hear about healing and Elohim, seems like magic. It’s not magic; it’s just a higher way of the rules of the Universe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">As we start to affiliate energies, I was using the terminology today of using the term ‘reservoir’ for group energy; maybe you were tuning in and grasping that in a different way. It’s different ways of saying the same thing.&nbsp; Maybe more intuitively we can see that idea of love, living inside each other and that we’re doing that. As we do that, we build a reservoir and that reservoir is not limited; it allows other people to tap into it as long as they’re coming in love. Love is the key that gets you into tapping into the energy of the reservoir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">When we have a healing list, in the highest sense, that list is connected to the reservoir. Of course, we don’t only have each other’s love living inside us; we have the love of these Sources that are working with us living inside us and us living inside them. There’s an enormous amount of power in that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I am opening up our healing list. That’s why this can work. It started as an experiment. As you see, the stuff I’m sharing with you right now I could only share with you if I learned it; none of this stuff can you find in books; this working knowledge of it can only come experientially.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If I read this in a book I don’t think I would have understood how to implement it. You know, being on these calls working with you, you working with these energies I think you understand it. It kind of makes sense. We’re learning this together. This is not metaphysical knowledge; this is not esoteric knowledge. This is actually working knowledge of doing something; learning how to do something and practically seeing how it works…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Father-Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light, to surround and protect Terry, myself, every person of this line, every person on the Internet listening and everyone who listens to the replays or reads the transcripts. We see this energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the planets, through the Milky Way, through the Solar System, through our bodies and into the center of the Earth. And right now we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive, service to others, honoring The Law of One to join with us. We create a protected space that only the Positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave <i>now</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We invite our Sources to give us the message of the day. And by the way, they are welcome to critique or change if they find my own human consciousness didn’t express something accurately, then that’s fine with me; in fact I hope they will clarify it from their point of view, so that you guys have the best information possible for this transition. Thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Today is the 17<sup>th</sup> of March 2013 and we are delighted, absolutely delighted, to be with you and make connection with everybody on the line or who reads a transcript or in any way comes in contact with this material.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">This morning Wynn has touched on a few of the very important things. One of them is the energy and the importance of connecting two energies that resonate you into health, that resonate you into well-being, that resonate you into the knowledge that you are loved and that you are worthwhile, because when you know that you are worthwhile and you know that you that worthy of love and you know that you are loved more than you can possibly imagine even, then it gives you a new option, instead of the options of either being created or created upon or creating, then there is a new option. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">That is the option of co-creating, the option of accepting what is going on with the other person without losing your sense of worth, without getting the feeling that you are being taken over, without being taken over by the other's energy; the option of holding your own space, your own values, your own integrity, without being taken into the energy of the other person and allowing yourself to be created upon, so you are holding your own values.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">You know your own worth; you know you are loved. However, you are accepting and allowing the other person to go through whatever it is that they are going through. And you can take a look at it and you can hold value for them and love for them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">And so it isn’t just a choice of being created upon or creating. There is co-creation modulated with acceptance and love for the other person. You can do that if you hold steadfast within yourself, within your own matrix structure knowing that you are loved, you are worthwhile and you are not just a rag doll that gets carried into every energy that comes along. However, you can observe, you can even co-create, you can feel what the other person is going through without being dragged into it totally, because you hold your own structure, you hold your own worth, you hold your own centering. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Above all, you can connect with the higher Sources and know that they are<b><span style="color: #92d050;"> </span></b>loving you. We are loving you. We are there for you, so that no matter what you are going through, if you can feel the energy of our love and get into that zone; this will help you hold your own centering, your own structure, your own worth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Because we value you; we treasure you; you are very, very significant; you are leaders in your time. The connection brings tears to our energy eyes, for we are making connection and it is possible to hold an energy reservoir with this connection and to help it back you up, to know you are loved. Thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">&nbsp; Thank you. And I say again that we’re doing this together. A call like we’re doing tonight can’t happen out of the blue. It’s as if I was talking to a public audience, how could I talk about this? They’re not part of this creation. They have to choose to start paying attention, coming to the calls and feeling the energy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Otherwise, they’re just the public. They’re coming to be acted upon and it’s ok, because it starts that way. But notice the difference. This is a public call in a sense because it’s not secret; it’s not restricted; it’s open to everyone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But in another sense it’s not a public call, because you folks are coming and coming and holding the energy for it and you’re co-creating the call. This is not an entertaining call. It may entertain you, but I’m not entertaining. This kind of blew me away when I realized it; I start talking and I can go on and on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I can talk for a long time and I don’t think people get bored; people are really engaged. Now one of the reasons I can do this is, because we’re talking to the One; it’s only one energy. And I’m only talking to myself, the larger part of myself that’s in you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">You know, these are all different ways of saying the same thing, right? We talk about a reservoir; we talk about The Law of One. You can get it in your mind that we’re all moving and growing with that experience. And there’s a power there in it. Find an image to work with during the course of your day that you can actually work with, that actually works for you, like the reservoir, or that we live inside of each other; or anything that helps you tap into this energy, this energy that’s always there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">And right, now let’s move into that energy which we’re already into and move into that group consciousness which we’ve already created and apply it to the healing of our planet. Understanding how this really works, we are group energy creating intentions that are able to manifest. In fact, most things manifest through group energies and intentions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">What did Margaret Mead say? It’s a small group of people that can change the world and in fact, it’s the only thing that’s ever done so—that’s <i>usually</i> ever done so. I don’t know, she had the word usually, but she’s right; we’re a small group of people and we’re holding a pure intent and we’re working with positive Sources that are adding to our intent and we’re co-creating together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We’re building energies in other dimensions and we are learning how to do it, even though we can’t see it, we know we’re doing it. And we take this group energy and we surround our planet with it. Kind of like, “He’s got the whole world in His hands”, well, we’ve got the whole world in our hands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
