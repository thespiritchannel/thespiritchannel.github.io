<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">I constantly have reiteration that they are, in fact, who they say they are.&nbsp; Many of you have heard the story umpteen times.&nbsp; The only reason I tell the story so much is because it causes people to pay attention.&nbsp; It’s hard to get people’s attention in this realm.&nbsp; People are occupied; they have their lives, their families, their jobs, their struggles, their traumas, their challenges.&nbsp; If you’re communicating with a source that created the physical universe, there has to be some benefit to you as a person.&nbsp; It could just be a curiosity – “Oh, there they are.”&nbsp; Ultimately, if it’s going to stick, it has to mean something. It has to change your life, contribute to your life in some way.&nbsp; Many of the people who are listening to this call and have listened to these calls regularly have had life-changing situations (and) circumstances.&nbsp; They've gone deeper, they felt connected, they became more loving, they had a synchronicity where something happened that may not have happened otherwise.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">There are not that many people out there who are communicating with the Elohim.&nbsp; Even in the narrow margin: there are not that many people, even when I think someone is communicating, that I would bring them on this show.&nbsp; So often, when you’re in front of the public and when you’re getting attention, people compete with each other.&nbsp; That’s not a good energy.&nbsp; Those of you who have heard our Carla Rueckert calls know that there is no competition between Carla and myself; we respect each other and honor the work we’re both doing.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">A couple of weeks ago I was browsing the internet and I found, on UTube – you guys are welcome to look this up – a series of twelve videos where it was introduced that this person was channeling the Elohim on those videos and they were giving a message to us, or to the people on the video.&nbsp; I listened to some of the messages, and I said, “It does have a resonance with the source that I’ve been talking to.”&nbsp; I looked up the name of the person who was doing the channeling:&nbsp; Rebecca Jernigan.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">I remembered that in 2004 when the book came out “The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce” I was on the internet radio show called “Journeys with Rebecca” with the same Rebecca Jernigan who was channeling the Elohim on these UTubes.&nbsp; I didn’t know she was channeling the Elohim; she never said anything about it on her website.&nbsp; Maybe she did, but maybe I didn’t see it.&nbsp; She never said anything about it on the radio show.&nbsp; Of course, at that time, I never said anything about it even though I was having that experience.&nbsp; My book had come out and I wasn’t talking about the Elohim.&nbsp; I was apprehensive about talking about it.&nbsp; I said, “I’m already wacky enough writing the book “The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce.”&nbsp; To bring in me talking through two women, a source that identifies itself as the creator of the physical universe I thought would take my credibility and run it through the mill.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">We had an interview.&nbsp; I called Rebecca and we connected and I told her a little bit about my Elohim story and she told me a little bit about her Elohim story.&nbsp; I said, “Why don’t we do a session and just feel the resonance of it?” which we did.&nbsp; Those of you who got the email today, there are two links to that session we did.&nbsp; I don’t even remember what we talked about, but I do remember it had the same feel and resonance of the source we talk to on this call.&nbsp; Keep in mind that if you paid attention to this work and listened to the channelings, each person who channels the Elohim sounds different; it goes through their matrix, their thoughts, their structure, and it becomes connected to that person's individuality.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">For example, Daphne sounds very much different from Terry although if you pay close attention, you’ll see the connection.&nbsp; I would say Rebecca sounds different from both of them; maybe a little bit more like Terry than Daphne.&nbsp; Nonetheless, there is a resonance.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">We’re going to explore that on this show.&nbsp; Rebecca is my guest tonight and we’re going to discuss her experience with the Elohim.&nbsp; I don’t know if she often does that publicly; she has, on her radio show, she has had so many famous people from David Icke to God-knows-who.&nbsp; She’s been doing it for ten years, and she’s taken her role to be a presenter of different people who have something that she feels is valuable to offer.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">Rebecca, how would you like to introduce yourself? That was my best shot.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">That’s kind of a loaded question on how to get started here.&nbsp; You and I have talke<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">d </b>about:&nbsp; You’ve said that you were introduced to the Elohim I think in 2002, yes?&nbsp; </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">They were always with me; they’ve always been my mentors.&nbsp; They have been my teacher.&nbsp; I haven’t had any physical teachers in this life cycle; I haven’t had any that I have gone to for mentoring or teaching the way that a lot of people do.&nbsp; They have always been my teachers, and they’ve been very succinct with me through the years.&nbsp; If I ask them a question they will answer me whether I want to hear what I think I want to hear or not.&nbsp; They’re very honest; they tell you like it is – at least for me they do, when I ask for my own individual curiosity whatever questions as I’m out there trying to figure out what’s the meaning of life kind of a thing.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><span style="color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">They’ve always been with me.&nbsp; It wasn’t until the early ‘90s that I actually sat and channeled them.&nbsp; Some of the experiences were what you would call organic; where you just sit down and I stepped out of the way, knowing that was the process I was actually going through.&nbsp; I would come back a little while later and there would have been people standing there and looking at me and their information was quite astounding.&nbsp; I have a friend of mine that recorded a lot of the old channelings that I did and it was pretty profound if we’d been sitting here going through the information again after all these years.&nbsp; I did do some channeling, I’m here locally in </span><span style="color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Kansas City</span><span style="color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">.&nbsp; I did do some channeling here locally for quite a few years.&nbsp; I moved out of the area back in the late ‘90s, and when I returned in the early 2000’s I did not channel publicly.&nbsp; That’s where the radio shows came in.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">Getting back to the Elohim:&nbsp; it was in the 90’s when somebody asked me who it was I was actually communicating with.&nbsp; Like I said, I never even thought about it, Wynn.&nbsp; I never thought to ask them who it was.&nbsp; I was doing energy work; we used to have open houses.&nbsp; I had a store, and we used to do these free healing sessions on people; energy exchanges, actually.&nbsp; They came in the middle of this as I’m working on this person who is lying down and running energy.&nbsp; They said, “We are the Elohim.”&nbsp; They were so loud that I really thought everybody else could hear them.&nbsp; It’s always been the same voice; it’s always been the same energy that I’ve felt since I was a young girl.&nbsp; I asked them to repeat it again, and they said that I needed to look them up and that which was written about them isn’t necessarily all that they are and that I would come to know more about them – I needed to do the research.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">That’s what I did – I began to research.&nbsp; I asked people, “Do you know who they are?”&nbsp; A lot of people took me different directions.&nbsp; Some of it resonated.&nbsp; A lot of it didn’t according to books that were written or how they were addressed or what have you.&nbsp; I think you, yourself, would agree – maybe not, Wynn&nbsp; - I think you, yourself ,would agree their dimension to them is far greater than that which has been written about them: about who they are, how they interacted and what their actual history is as it pertains to human beings<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">.</b></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">One of the things about the Elohim and the Ra group is never ever do they disempower you or me. (Just ask) questions.&nbsp; Those of you who are on the call, even though you come back over and over again, it’s not like you’re following something.&nbsp; From the outside somebody would say “You’re following that.”&nbsp; You’re just showing up and what happens is what happens.&nbsp; My goal, which I’ve kind of succeeded in is to create – I was talking to somebody – myself as being this corny host who makes a safe spot and a comfortable spot so they can come in and not have to be in any level of pretension.&nbsp; That’s a pretty rare thing to do.&nbsp; Those of you who are listening to these calls over and over again might go back and remember how it amazing it was when you first started to discover that we’re doing this so casually.&nbsp; We don’t have any fanfare, no ritual, no big deals – yet, the most extraordinary things happen on these calls.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: large;">I just knew; I’m going to tell you:&nbsp; patience was never one of my virtues in this life cycle, never, but working with the Elohim all these years, there is just this sense of knowing and there comes this peace and this comfort.&nbsp; You just know when the time is right that there will be others that you will find or they will find you.&nbsp; Somehow, that divine process will happen.&nbsp; You just don’t think about it; it’s just this sense of knowing.&nbsp; You move forward in your life and then it shows up and it’s just like they said it would be or it’s just like how it felt to me.&nbsp; So I’m pretty excited.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">It’s a matter of learning how to select, with your remote control, the frequency that you’re going to allow to come in.&nbsp; They’re right next to everyone who is listening right now; they’re not far away.&nbsp; They’re right next to you.&nbsp; They’re an energy.&nbsp; Can you tune into their frequency?&nbsp; Shut your eyes for a moment and feel the space; notice if it feels different than it normally feels.&nbsp; Consider the possibility that the difference in your space right now is this very same Elohim that we’re talking about except you’re not a channel.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Wynn</b>:&nbsp; At one point we had the Ra group come individually through Terry and Daphne; mostly it started with the Elohim group.&nbsp; The Ra group started coming in secondarily.&nbsp; I actually felt guilty about talking to the Ra group because I’d become friends with Carla Rueckert and she was the prime person that brought in the Ra group in 1981. They said it was a very unique opportunity for them to communicate.&nbsp;&nbsp; So when they started talking to me I thought, “I hope Carla doesn’t find out because she’ll get mad at me.”&nbsp; Nonetheless, she and I have become good friends; she’s on our show once a month.&nbsp; Sometime we might have all four of us on a group show; Carla, you and Terry.&nbsp; Each of us represents a template of energy, and when they bring this template together as a group, I know it’s powerful.&nbsp; It brings in a lot of energies into the earth realm just to have us all here.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">If you would like, I could have your sources address us, then Terry to address us.&nbsp; The source that comes through Terry says it’s Ra’An which is a combination of the Elohim and Ra group. so they say.&nbsp; The reason they used the word 'Ahn' is historically when Daphne first started.&nbsp; If I was to give you the history of the whole way this started for me, the first voice that came through Daphne identified itself as P’tah.&nbsp; I was very much a novice; I was just asking questions to try and figure it out.&nbsp; We had two or three conversations with P’tah.&nbsp; Then, a voice came through Daphne that identified itself as the Council of Ahn.&nbsp; They were indicating that P’tah was kind of an emissary.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">Then, we had a few conversations with the Council of Ahn and probably in the sixth or seventh time we did a session, the voice came as the Council of Elohim.&nbsp; I’m trying to figure out who is talking to me and why they’re switching.&nbsp; I was mistrustful, because I wanted to trust one source, and suddenly I’ve got three different sources.&nbsp; I was already on guard by studying them enough to say it’s possible to have a negative source but they never asked anything of me; they just said ask them questions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">Then it was explained that P’tah was an emissary of the Ra group.&nbsp; P’tah was much less spaced out, much more specific, earthy answers to things.&nbsp; It was P’tah that did that newspaper prediction early on with Daphne.&nbsp; Then, when I asked about the Council of Ahn, the Council of Ahn was sub-set a sub-council of the Elohim that was responsible for translating the geometric language of the Elohim into the language of a location, like earth.&nbsp; This is what they said; I didn’t know this was true.&nbsp; I’m just telling you what they said.&nbsp; They were translating the language of the Elohim into English so we could understand it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">Then, the Council of Elohim came in; then there was another Council that came in – I don’t remember the name.&nbsp; It was one other council that was part of the Elohim Council.&nbsp; During that period there was another voice that came in that said it was the Council of Twelve.&nbsp; The Council of Twelve was described as twelve very huge beings; maybe they were twelve Elohim beings or maybe they were some Elohim in and some Ra, I can’t remember.&nbsp; Their purpose, their function - the Council of Twelve - was to interface – they said there was like a cabinet, like a president with a cabinet to make recommendations to the Elohim.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">As I was understanding it, the Council of Twelve would monitor the earth and look for situations of high vibration here where people were coming together in a high way and creating a highly intended group energy.&nbsp; They would find those energies; they would then petition the Elohim to support that energy.&nbsp; They'd observe a bunch of people mediating somewhere and they might say, “Okay let’s bring some energy into those monks or those people meditating.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">As that was being described to me, I asked a question: “I’m bringing energy into this realm directly from the Elohim and I’m not going though the Council of Twelve; or, I didn’t think I was.”&nbsp; I started to experience that there was an energy coming in when I did things.&nbsp; Then they said, “The Elohim has free will and choice; they’re not bound to go through the Council of Twelve and that what I was doing was creating great opportunities to bring their energy into this realm.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">That’s a little of my history.&nbsp; For the longest time, we just talked to the Elohim.&nbsp; Let me just say, when I was communicating through Daphne there were a number of other sources that came through.&nbsp; I was always a little bit apprehensive because I was afraid of negative sources.&nbsp; There were times when a voice that come through that said, “This is Mother Mary”, “This is Archangel Michael.”&nbsp; I was never sure of those; I would just ask questions and try to see where it went.&nbsp; Another time it was the Planet Jupiter.&nbsp; Jupiter wanted to talk to us and bring good fortune.&nbsp; Another time it was the Solar Logos; the Solar Logos was, if you’ve been listening to our calls, Solar Logos was the name for the center of our galaxy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">Of course, all these things are alive; theoretically you can talk to Jupiter, you can talk to the earth, you can talk to the Sun.&nbsp; They all have a consciousness to them.&nbsp; But it gets really confusing because how do you know they are who they say they are and how do you know they’re positive and how do you know you can trust them?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">With Terry, I’ve never looked for any other sources, but they brought in the Ra and the Ahn which is the Ahn Council of the Elohim, and the Ra energy.&nbsp; Would like to do something, Rebecca?&nbsp; You don't have to.&nbsp; Don't be put on the spot.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Terry</b>:&nbsp; I just wanted to say something; Rebecca, I welcome your participation.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Rebecca</b>:&nbsp; They have some messages here that they’d like to share.&nbsp; As you all were listening and talking, they’ve been chatting at me about what they would like to say.&nbsp; Give me just a second; we’ll have them come in and I’ll say a few things, or they will rather.&nbsp; Then, they’re going to step aside.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Wynn</b>:&nbsp; We’re used to doing a little protective invocation; we’ve already gotten the energies, but I’m so used to doing it and people are so used to doing it.&nbsp; Is it okay if I do my little invocation?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Rebecca</b>:&nbsp; Yes, if you need to - sure<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">.</b></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Wynn</b>:&nbsp; I don’t need to if you prefer not to; we don’t have to.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">Rebecca:&nbsp; It’s fine<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">.</b></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Wynn</b>:&nbsp; I’ll do it very quickly here.&nbsp; We bring in the light of the highest realm of the universe; we bring in this light to surround and protect each person here and we release any negativity to the higher realms of light for the highest good of all concerned.&nbsp; Everyone listening, everyone on the replays, we’re going to invoke a group energy connection and we invite those sources that are positive, service to others, honoring the Law of One to join our group energy.&nbsp; We maintain the sovereign integrity of our souls, our individualities while we do this.&nbsp; We create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">I turn it over to Rebecca to bring forth communication from those sources whom she has been talking about.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Elohim</b>:&nbsp; Greetings; we are the Elohim.&nbsp; We have but a few things to share.&nbsp; From our view, from our perspective, we are embracing this meeting of all these people on this call.&nbsp; We are honored that you honor energy that sits in your space.&nbsp; We are here to share nations, to expand, to give you the understanding of what great sovereign beings you are.&nbsp; Those of you who have remained on this reincarnation wheel for a very long time.&nbsp; We have always been and we will always be.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">I want to just be sure that I give Rebecca<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> </b>a plug:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.journeyswithrebecca.com/">www.journeyswithrebecca.com</a> .&nbsp; Rebecca, you do readings also, right?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Rebecca</b>:&nbsp; I don’t know what was said, but that was a pretty emotional state for a moment at a very good frequency.&nbsp; Wow.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Rebecca</b>:&nbsp; I don’t usually get quite as many benefits from it, but it’s still here.&nbsp; It’s very interesting, it’s very beautiful.&nbsp; I thank them for that; it makes me want to weep - not from sadness either.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">I’m extremely grateful for all of you tonight, I really am.&nbsp; I do a radio show called journeyswithrebecca, I’m on Monday through Friday 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. Central Time Friday<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">s </b>are 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. Central time, but I also do readings.&nbsp; I do all kinds of different readings.&nbsp; I also am involved with a process that they have given me through the years in order to accelerate awareness and getting off of what's called the reincarnation wheel.&nbsp; It doesn’t mean that you cease to exist, it means to be able to heal time lines, reduce trauma, re-write the past energetically; it literally changes the physiology of the individual going through this process.&nbsp; It’s just been absolutely fantastic.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">They’ve been giving me the process for years and we’ve fine-tuned it.&nbsp; With this new energy that is very, very present, extreme energy that is present these days, it allows a person to go through these things in a very quick manner and find that you are lifting burdens that you didn’t even know you were carrying; you find that relationships work better than what you ever could have thought.&nbsp; You are in such a heightened state of awareness once you’re able to start carrying these time lines kind of a thing.&nbsp; It’s a really fascinating process.&nbsp; I do this once a month as a small class, it’s an online workshop.&nbsp; I also do them in private sessions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;">I’m literally in the process of building a new website.&nbsp; That should be up by the end of the week but you can find some of the information at <a href="http://www.journeyswithrebecca.com/">www.journeyswithrebecca.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also go to <a href="http://www.rebeccajernigan.com/">www.rebeccajernigan.com</a> for additional information, more things like that.&nbsp; I’m combining both of them and hopefully by the end of this week I should have my new website up.&nbsp; It’s just going to be really 'the bomb.'</span></p>
