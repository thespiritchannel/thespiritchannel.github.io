<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have to make you laugh, Susan.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t have to, but I know laughing and not taking things seriously is the first step in feeling energy you know.<span>&nbsp; </span>Did you know that?<br /><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One of the reasons you don’t feel energy on this line when you want to, is you need to build a certain amount of stair-stepping up in your own system.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If you don’t do that, the energy comes in at the top and it can make you dizzy and it can make you out of balance.<span>&nbsp; </span>It wouldn’t be necessarily good for you to feel the energy at that moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s at least my take on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>The energy comes in at very high chakra levels and when you’re going through healing wounded areas in your body, it has to be more gentle in the way it shows up.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On that note – Terry’s not ready, right?<br /><br /><br /></span><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>No; I’m never ready.<br /><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is serious now and I want us to come into a more sacred energy, a more still energy,<span>&nbsp; </span>What happens is, we start to heal some of our stuff when we laugh and enjoy each other in a genuine way.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then when we come back to ourselves, we feel more present with our self.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of you have gone through that when we were doing this on the line, and in this still space we start to feel the energies from other dimensions and our sources.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe some of you are feeling them now who have not felt them in the past because you were laughing so hard.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re listening to replays, you’re going to have to come on the call early to figure out what we’re laughing about, so – please do.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One of the things here is this is a come as you are party; you don’t have to look good or be something.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s okay to come in just as you are because you can only change from where you are.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you come as you are, there’s the potential for shift, and if you try to be something or look like something or have some kind of attachment to the way people see you, it freezes everything and things don’t shift; things are stuck.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of you know that; you can go through a whole lifetime with things being stuck.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of you have felt that way.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re going to call in the light:<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Father Mother God we ask for the presence of the light to surround and protect each person here and any negativity be taken to the highest realms of light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned.<span>&nbsp; </span>We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the outer energy fields of the earth; through the sun, the moon – through our bodies and into the center of the earth.<span>&nbsp; </span>I meant to say through the energy fields of the planets and then through our bodies.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Right now we invoke a group energy; a blending of all our energies.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is something that either we make pretend we’re or we’re doing; I think we’re doing it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think we’re meeting in another dimension right now.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve moved our energies through the veil and there’s a special feeling that comes in.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of you feel it in the top of your head.<span>&nbsp; </span>We create this blending while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls, which means we’re not a glom; we’re free-willing group that is choosing, for these few minutes that we have together, to commune our energies.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have these sources that are on the same dimension, they drop down into it, and they join with us.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have this big conglomeration of energy that we’re creating just by our intention.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Take a moment, and if your mind is chattering away that’s okay; if you’re here for the first time and you’re not sure what the heck we’re doing, that’s okay.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you keep listening to these calls, for many people – this may not be for everybody, for many people – there’s a magic that happens; a connection that happens things and things shift in your life and you become more of who you are.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is empowering; it’s not disempowering.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s nothing to follow here; it’s just a matter of showing up and connecting with the energies.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve invited our sources in, and we create a protected space that only the positive has access to, and anything not of that nature must leave now.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We’ll let our sources greet us and we’ll ask some of the questions for tonight.<br /><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">However individuals can moderate, through prayer, some of the earthquakes and bring them to a less intensity, as they, through their prayers, attenuate the situation and help mother earth to align in harmony<b>.<br /><br /></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>When we look at a structure such as the resulting structure of earth, and then we look to the scene behind the earth, the structures, the energies, that hold it together.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There, in the structure of the earth plane, is the – we do not know the words in the English language for this – there is the template, there is the model.<span>&nbsp; </span>The structure of the earth is filled in and built according to the model.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Individuals, in their conscious state, can have an affect upon this model, or upon this template so that if a section of earth – say the San Andreas – is getting ready to release, then beings of high consciousness can affect the template, or the model, and can breathe light within the framework of the original template can rewrite the happenings in the time in streaming.<span>&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Therefore individuals, when they pray, and when they have us available also, can – in the gradient of energies and frequencies from your level to our level, of which the earth template is a part – can be affected by the rewriting of the potential shifts within the original matrix template.<span>&nbsp; </span>The original matrix template can shift also.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is not a fixed structure; it is a created, you may say, energy structure.<span>&nbsp; </span>Individuals may have an effect upon what is written and occurs within the structure<b>.<br /><br /></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When we pray, our prayers go into the non-physical area and it gives the opportunity if enough people are doing that to re-arrange the template in that area, which then causes something to change in the physical.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s probably a good explanation of how prayer works in general, because prayer is accessing our higher energies that exist in the template; we all exist in that template simultaneously with existing in the physical.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can’t see ourselves directly, but we can access it through prayer and through intention; is that a correct interpretation?<br /><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One of the things is, maybe that’s not positive.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you start to open up to higher frequencies, you have to be very careful – this is Wynn commenting – about what you open up to and have a lot of discernment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes we’re so hungry for phenomena, that if we get a phenomenon we get all excited and it may not be from the right place.<span>&nbsp; </span>Martin is asking, “Can you tell me what that sound is?<span>&nbsp; </span>Wow.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Then he says when he asked his question, “a hummingbird just flew right up to my face and stared at me in the eyes.”<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Do you want to make any comments about Martin’s experience?<br /><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gary</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> has a note that he’s already gone to the center in </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Santa Monica</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and he’s got some stuff for alkalinity, so they’re already looking at him.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>We suggest that he personally has an appointment with Dr. Marshall, in that Dr. Marshall can set out a program for him.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Right; thank you.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m just going to put this out.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can give a response, but I’m not expecting a response:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carrie Trowbridge: we’re just sending healing for her nephew Lex.<span>&nbsp; </span>Carrie, I want to suggest that if you want healing for somebody it’s really good to come on these calls; hold the frequency of the energy, and it’s even better to bring the person on the call – because it works through your energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>We send the energy anyway, sometimes something might happen but if you’re really serious, get on the call live.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I say the same thing for Vickie; maybe she’s on the call.<span>&nbsp; </span>She wants to send healing energy to her daughters whom she is separated from and disconnected; she misses them a lot.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we send the light to Vickie.<span>&nbsp; </span>These are people who sent these things in the last minute.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On some of the questions tonight, we have two questions which I don’t think I’m going to ask.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them is from Kim; Kim I don’t know if that’s like a legal problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>We'll send the light to it but I don’t know if it’s appropriate to ask them the complexity of it.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can submit it again next week because I don’t want to keep Terry in a trance much longer.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We have here Greg – this is interesting – Daphne channeled an answer to Greg concerning Greg’s friend Jesse and sending help with the Parkinson’s.<span>&nbsp; </span>Apparently Daphne mentioned Jesse’s last name which Jesse never gave.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just pointing that out.<span>&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On the stuff you’re asking about, Greg – one of the things I don’t do is try to validate or invalidate other people.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, Wilcock is talking about mass arrests, and I’m not going to go into saying where that’s coming from for him or anything about it; that’s what he does.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are all kinds of people who are saying things.<span>&nbsp; </span>First of all, some of the stuff Terry doesn’t understand, so she’d have to get it through her conscious mind I think, to get them on board to understand it.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In general, when other people say things about what’s happening, what’s going on, I don’t think it’s in the best interests of the work we’re doing to talk about other people’s predictions and whatever publicly.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m not going to ask that.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Let me see if there is anything else here<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think this covered everything except for Kim and Greg’s question.<span>&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I want to thank every one of you for being on this line and holding the space.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jim had a question, but he’s not on the line, so Jim I’m not going to ask your question tonight, you’re going to have to ask it again next week.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Thank you so much for being here; our sources thank you for being here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those of you who are on the line, those of you who are asking questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those of you that are asking questions, some of you are really putting a lot of your heart into your questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>I really appreciate you trusting us to be vulnerable like that; we honor the space.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope we have given something to help.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I want to say, those of you who are feeling separated, alienated and disconnected, and yet are tuned into this work we’re doing, we have something called 'Team Shift.'<span>&nbsp; </span>You can meet once a day with a group of people and call in the light.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s been very healing for many people who have participated.<span>&nbsp; </span>They have found spiritual kinship over the phone where they couldn’t find it in their life.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re interested, go to teamshift.messageaday.net.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s a little form there; fill it out and answer the hours you’re available.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’re not committing to anything; if it doesn’t work for you you don’t have to do it.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can come in three or four times a week, but essentially it’s a once a day meeting for five or ten minutes, and a little longer if you start to talk but the essence of the call is five or ten minutes and calling in the light, putting your issue in the light every day.<span>&nbsp; </span>It really helps to make a connection.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Also I want to plug my website intelligent-infinity.com.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are a lot of great little videos with Elohim messages on it if you just watch them help lift your energy and tune you in.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s an introduction; we’re going to be putting a lot more on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Take a visit, watch the videos, make comments if you feel like it; help get the energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Send it to other people.<span>&nbsp; </span>Look at it so that you could say, “If I sent this to so-and-so they might respond.”<span>&nbsp; </span>The first thing people come to on the website is they can get my book for free so they can download it and read it: [at] intelligent-infinity.com.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Whenever I’m thanking people who are doing transcripts sometimes I seem to have forgotten Gina; so thank you, Gina.<span>&nbsp; </span>She’s been doing transcripts for some time now and we really appreciate your efforts.<span>&nbsp; </span>On that note, we’re going to open up the lines.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We’ll see some of you Sunday; by the way, this Sunday is going to be a really short call.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t know how much Terry and I am going to be there.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re going to be in </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Denver</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> at what’s called a New Age Trade Show; I’m doing a book signing there and I’m going to be talking about myself to everyone there.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s going on Sunday morning; it starts at </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">10:00 a.m.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">; I think that’s </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11:00</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> in </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Denver</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span>&nbsp; </span>Somehow I’m going to have to figure out how other people can do some of the things we do – maybe Gijs will be there.<span>&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gijs, are you on the line?<br /><br /></span></p>
