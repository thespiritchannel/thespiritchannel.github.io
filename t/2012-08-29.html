<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Callers:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">singing “I just called to say I love you…”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Alright everybody is muted; I’d like to thank everybody. You can see why they put me in this job. Thank you, Gijs. Don’t mute <i>me</i> okay?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I’m not very administrative, but I’m learning how to do it. I hate commitments and I’m really getting good at commitments, because I’m showing up.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You know what the problems with commitments are? You know how you’re moody; everyone is moody. Everyone is moody, and it’s easy to make commitments when you have to show up when you happen to wake up on a good day. But, when you wake up on a bad day, you say “Oh my God, they’re going to see me on a bad day.” </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">That’s the problem with doing these calls, because you got to show up. The good news about it, as you all know—most of you know—I finally found a job I can do in my underwear. I don’t have to worry about combing my hair.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">(The sound of someone hanging up their phone)</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Uh oh – there’s one of those holier-than-thou people; they said “Uh oh, I thought this was spiritual.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">One of the things is, I remember when they were first talking to me. I said “How do you do this in the world? Are you serious and somber and sacred?” I said “I hope not; I’m not good at that. Can you do it this way? Can you do it that way?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This is our call where people have submitted questions. Those of you who have been coming into the calls regularly and even not for that long, have noticed that there is an interesting phenomenon that happens in this call.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There’s an energy that comes in that many people feel. Some people feel it really strongly; it feels like they’ve suddenly got lights in their room. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We’re talking to voices that identify themselves as group souls, two of them that have blended. Some of you heard the Ra group on Monday and you’ll notice that it was quite a bit different. I recommend going back and listening to last Monday’s call which is in our archives at <i>thespiritchannel.net</i>. Usually we talk to a group, the Ra group and the Elohim group and both of these Sources have different points of view. I believe they both have the same ultimate end: to help us understand and evolve ourselves. Both of them are important.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Somebody said “How do I make better connection?” Read Carla Rueckert’s Law of One; read everything we put out; read the archives. There’s so much stuff in there. It’s not that well organized, so you have to work a little bit to go through it. Sooner or later we’ll get it organized and make it into little pdf books. You never know what they’re going to say that’s going to trigger something that releases something in you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Many of you who are attracted to this work are actually old souls. In this realm, it’s hard to find the things that trigger, that remind you of your heritage. If you happen to be one of those old souls—you don’t have be an old soul; there’s another situation where people are newer souls. But, if you happen to be one of those older souls, that means you’ve gone through a lot of lifetimes. In your track there are a lot of cellular memories and when you start hearing things that are the right things, it starts to stimulate your track. It starts to stimulate your cells, and you go “Aha! That’s it.” Many of you are having these experiences already.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Some of you are curious about it; you’ve heard about us. You’ve heard us on Coast. We put out a constant stream of stuff. If you really get what we’re doing, you’ll try to pay attention to as much as we can.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I say “we”; see?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m you; we’re we—because it’s all on downloadable mp3s. What some people do is they download it, they play it on the way to work; they play it on their walkman. They play it in the background. It’s much better than watching network TV; that’s for sure. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It’s a way of ingraining this stuff in you. It has nothing to do with a belief-pattern; it does not have anything to do with saying “I believe Wynn is real; I think the Elohim are real.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think what he’s doing is real.” It has to do with incorporating these energies so that you can sense them, feel them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The key thing that I’ve learned, this was a surprise to me, the way that most people feel these energies. It’s as if you feel like who you normally are, but it suddenly feels expanded. You feel a sense around you. It’s like if I was going to explain how I understand that, that sense you feel around you is their energies blending with your field. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">So, they’re not separate from you; they come in as part of you. They’re just a big, expanded part of you. You probably won’t see them as hugely expanded, because you’re only able to feel around your own immediate space. But, you can feel a sense of connection; it feels like you’re not alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If you practice and fool around and experiment, then you kind of talk to that energy and ask it for things, act as if that little energy that’s around you is a friend. You suddenly find it responds. It’s not me that’s doing it; it’s not Terry that’s doing it. We just happen to be bringing through a voice that says it’s that energy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It took me a long time to believe that and I expect it should take you a while, some of you. Some of you will get it right away. Some of you will just say “That’s too incredible.” Just keep paying attention. It’s kind of like out of this consensus reality. Traditionally, that particular experience has been often interpreted as God. But we’re bringing in a totally new way of understanding it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When you’re dealing with energies that come from other dimensions into this dimension, you do have to be very scrutinizing. When you’re dealing with channeling you have to be very careful. The reason is, once you start moving your energy fields into these other dimensions, you’re in areas where you can’t see where you are.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It’s very easy to get involved with something that goes bump in the night. The other side is filled with negative guys waiting to talk to you. And, they’re much easier to talk to than the positive guys, because all they have to do is come in and talk to your ego; tell you how great you are, how they’ve picked you for this mission. Most people get hooked; particularly if they can do something psychic.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In fact, when this first started happening to me in 2002, I was already aware of that idea through the work I had done studying Carla Rueckert and David Wilcock. I was not jumping to any big conclusion about who was talking to me. I said “What if this is one of those guys that that I read about?” </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It’s best to learn to feel the energy, because if you can feel the energy, if you can feel this loving energy in your space, and suddenly, you’re lying down and you’re meditating and you can feel that energy, at that point, if you hear a voice whisper to you it might be them. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Still, always check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out. If it’s a very loving energy, the negative does not come in. In fact, they can’t come in, as I understand it, on a loving energy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We have a load of questions tonight. I’m never going to get them all; we’re going to do some of them. Before we go into the questions, one thing is, that on Saturday we’re going to do a three-or-four-hour session channeled, mostly channeled.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If I can answer the question I will. I have so many questions I’ve asked and so much experience that sometimes I can answer it and that saves the channels the energy on it. We’re going go for three or four hours, asking your questions. That’ll be a call like this, but there will be a time for a lot more questions. I would suggest not missing this call.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We’re getting bigger. Right now, if we do a three or four hour call, we might get to most of the questions. At some point, we’ll never get to all the questions. You know we used to do this call every Wednesday and we could get to all the questions. Now, we can’t get to maybe 20% of the questions that come in, if that much. Take advantage of that call on Saturday. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If you go to the home page of our website, which is <i>intelligent-infinity.com</i>, there’s a thing that says “The Coast Special”. You’ll click on a page and it says $15; not only do you get to be on this call Saturday, you get a four-hour workshop that I did for the first time I was on George Noory for all the people that listened, an audio workshop. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You get them both. Some of you already bought the audio workshop for $10 and you didn’t get the thing on Saturday, the extra $5. I’m going to be sending an email to everybody that’s in that position and offer them the option to upgrade for $5. That’s it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Let me just see here. Terry, Daphne’s not going to be on tonight. She wasn’t feeling well; she’s taking a break. So, Terry’s going to handle this. Terry, are you there?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Great. We have great questions tonight.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Are you in the kitchen, Terry?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you’re going to be in the kitchen, try not to be there when you’re channeling.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Laughing: I won’t!</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I hear the dishes rattling. Now I told everybody, so they’re really going to listen for it now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">One of the great things about doing this on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>a conference call—a lot of people do workshops and they travel—and they have to charge quite a bit of money to cover their expenses and to make a profit and the hotel rooms and the hotels and everything. One of the beautiful things about doing this on a conference call, we could charge, but we don’t charge anything. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It’s right in your home, so when the vibrations get lifted instead lifting the vibrations in a hotel room, you’re lifting the vibes exactly where you live.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can do it three times a week or more, doing the things we’re doing.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I’m sure some of you know this experience; I do. You go to a great weekend workshop and it’s very inspiring. You learned all this stuff. Two weeks later, you don’t remember a thing and you’re back to where you are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This is a beautiful opportunity; I don’t think anyone has ever done anything like this before, to create this kind of intimate connection, this kind of connection of oneness, that offers everybody the opportunity to participate for absolutely no money. That is miracle, if you think about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is not a low-level thing; this is a high level thing. You couldn’t pay to find this and yet you’ve all found it and it’s free.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When we sell something, even for $5 or $15 or $3, please take advantage of it. In spite of the fact we do all this stuff for free, we all have to have roofs over our heads; we all want to expand this. This is something that could change our planet. This is something that could have millions of people; can you imagine having a million people on a conference call, saying “I just called to say I love you”? This is a chance.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I’m just saying what I believe to be true. This is a chance, a very unusual opportunity, to bring the energy of the heaven realms into this realm, so that it’s accessible to every single person that would reach for it. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You guys are part of that, just because you’re here, just because you’re feeling it, even if you tell just one other person. Just think truth. Don’t try to tell them about it; you’ll find the more you say; you’ll get in trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Send them a link to our website; let them watch my video. Let them download the book, just like you did. Just tell them it worked for you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Invite them to something you think they’ll resonate with, like our Sunday grid healing.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You have to use your own thoughts to think what works for somebody, but this is a really phenomenal opportunity and it’s an opportunity for you, just as well as it is for the planet, for our Sources, for Terry, myself and Daphne, to operate as a team, to get people on these lines and lift the vibration of planet earth. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We have people in other countries and we have just scratched the surface.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Using the internet the way we do, we can translate things into other languages.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">What is that thing going on in the background there?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Do you hear that Gijs?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I got it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I thank Gijs very much. He’s been volunteering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He just showed up one day when I had one of my resistant moments and I said “I’m going to be late today.” He started saying hello to everybody and he’s been doing it ever since. In fact, that’s how people ended up volunteering for us; they just showed up. If any of you have administrative experience, we need an administrator for volunteers. There are a lot of people who want to do things and I’m the worst person to administrate them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Somehow I’ve managed to administrate this as far as it’s gotten, but I can’t handle any more. So somebody out there is a good administrator. This is not about me, it’s about us. Every one has something to contribute and everyone has something to learn and grow into. I’m going to start these questions now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Father-Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Love Light, to surround and protect Terry, myself, every one of you on this line and everyone who is listening to replays and reading the transcripts. We let our negativity go into the highest dimensions of Light, to be transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Right now, we invoke a group energy connection amongst all of us present on this line.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Do you feel that energy coming around you, becoming part of you, flowing into you? That’s it; that’s them. That’s us; they’re us. We’re them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We invite those Sources that are positive to join with us and we create a protected space that only the positive has access to. Anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">On that note…</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We greet you in the love light of the one infinite Creator. Wynn – continue.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was saying I was going to introduce you; that’s the introduction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can go ahead.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We are here with you; this is Ra’An. This is </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">the 29<sup>th</sup> of August, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">. We greet each and every person that’s on the line or each and every person that’s going to be reading the transcripts and listening to the replay at any later time. We do that within the time frame of whenever they read the transcripts or whenever they listen to the replay.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We take a moment and we see the people on the call. We do not violate your free will. We are coming in contact as you wish it. We are extending our energy to you. We are in a different realm; we are in a different layer of All That Is. We move in with our light-pink Light into your realm and we touch and we are there for people that wish it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We look at the eastern part of your </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">United States</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">. We see along the Mississippi Delta the winds. And, we see the people in their houses; we see the fear that some of them are experiencing. Although they don’t sense it or see it or feel it, we wrap them in our Love Light, as they are children of All That Is, the same as all of us are.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We do not look at ourselves as being exalted; we look at our selves as being equals to each and every person who comes within the sound of our voice or each and every person who doesn’t come within the sound of our voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We are so delighted and it is sacred, that we have come together tonight.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. First question is from Antonietta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She asks:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If we are in union, do you think defense is necessary?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Where is Antonietta located?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">: I don’t know. It was one of those questions that sounded like not a personal question, but a general question.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. When one is in the third density and one is experiencing within the third density the hazards that can beset one, or the potential hazards that can beset one in the third density, this is a situation that one needs to be aware and one needs to have their intuition out to see if there is any potential danger in the area.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We see that when one is in the third density, there are situations that take into account duality. One of the greatest things that individuals in the third density can do is learn how to masterfully handle duality. As when one is in the third density they can be non-linear and they also are in the density of the higher realms. We place them in our protection when they ask. It is a balancing that can occur.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When one is in the third density, they, at the end of their life, move into the higher realms, if they are open to it. They can come back home if they are open to it. We provide support for that. So, the answer to your question is “yes and no.” At the level of our density, the tenth density, there is pure love and care and concern and caring. At that level we are all one and there is not need for protection in that density.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When one is able to maintain a sense of that tenth density at the same time they negotiate the third density, they can know that in their heart of hearts and in their soul they are always safe, and be centered. They do not need, in that connection, to be thrown off balance. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">However, to learn to bring that Love Light into the third density, so that as they negotiate the ins and the outs and the yeses and the no’s, the good things and the bad things, as they negotiate the duality in the density, if they can maintain their center and their, you might say their compass point to home, then they can masterfully negotiate. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There are several meanings for negotiate and we mean operate through whatever is thrown at them. This is a tall order; we hope this has shed some light or sense upon your question.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Next question—and all we have is the email address <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>- but, again it’s a general question. They ask:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">What is the difference between densities and dimensions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I would add timelines; because from my perspective, they are all different ways of saying the same thing. Can we have your answer to that please?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When you have the different layers within the realm of All That Is, one can be within, say, the third density wherein the items within this density are quite heavy. It is also called by some the third dimension. When one is in that space, it has a certain timeline; time moves very slowly within the third density. It is a good place where people can learn to grow and have more time to move through their life and the things that they need to know.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When you move into the fourth density, there is more Love Light available and things are moving faster. It is a different timeline. Because of the technological differences within those two sections or realms, people within those realms see things differently and they do not generally see into the other realm, as they are, you might say, surrounded by the veil of the body, the veil of the food they have eaten, the veil of the atmosphere, the veil of the consensus reality and it becomes one operational unit depending upon location within the third density.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When one moves into the fourth density, things are lighter; they flow faster. It is easier to move through things. Time is faster. When you move into the fifth density or dimension, which, we prefer density, then things are much more rarified and people can achieve things faster. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We say ‘people’; however, it is more energy units, beings of energy with very light bodies that are able to move quickly, as there is a different timeline and things are much quicker.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When you get into the tenth density, where we are, things are very, very fast. When we move into the third density, then, particularly as we first move in there, we become sometimes impatient because it takes so long for something to move through, even a conversation. Those are some differences. We prefer density to dimension, though some people call it dimension.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes it is; because the timelines in each density are different. If things flow faster, then time moves more quickly as you go up in the densities.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Each one, as they connect with the higher densities, is able to move and to flow with that density for the amount of focus and time that they have connected with that. And so then they begin to experience some of the Love Light and to drop some of the heaviness of the third density.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Aside from listening to the conference calls, how can I rapidly integrate and connect with the Elohim and broadcast their vibration out into our collective world? I should say the Elohim and-or the Ra group or any other higher dimensional frequency. That’s me adding that; because it’s not just the Elohim.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">What’s the best way for someone to learn to do that when they’ve learned to feel the energy on the calls?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When you learn to recognize the frequency, the signature, of the Elohim group, the color of the Elohim group, then you will know when you have tuned into it. Tuning into it brings muscle, the building of a muscle, where then you can more easily tune into it in the future, as you establish and we establish a track of connection to you, that then can bring you more easily into our frequency.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This is from northern </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Maine</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">. I think the person’s name is Linda; she has a lot of grief right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">They have a recently departed canine child, Grace. It is still surreal that she has left the earthly plane. Can you add anything at all to me personally about this? They want to release the grief of their dog, and they probably want to know their dog Grace is okay.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Give us a moment.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Your dog Grace loves you very, very much and is very much attached and committed to you. Give us a moment. Your dog Grace is holding for you, is around you in the spirit world and is still connected dearly to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We recommend that you say a few kind words; things that you said when she was alive. And, to cheer her up by saying those things and she will hear you. We recommend to let her have this closeness and you perhaps can feel her at sometimes. She experiences joy and she senses the energy connection that we have made and you have made on this call with her. It brings her joy to the extent of being ecstatic, as she has been heard and acknowledged.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Sometimes when one has departed, it is very hard, because the people just grieve and do not sense that one is still there. If you can simply acknowledge her presence without the physical body, but acknowledge her presence; give her some kind words every now and then in the day, once a day or so, she will be ecstatic. We recommend you let this relationship play out as she, in so being acknowledged, will eventually see her path to the next episode in her life.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">That is our answer.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“I heard you on Coast to Coast; I’m pleased to hear all you have done. Terry sounds so angelic. I had a teacher who passed away and she is now with her masters; but, I miss her. She had a center called The New World Peace Center. We had many classes on many subjects, including angels.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">She is a grounded person and a caring person.

Next question is from Abymolah Abosija.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It sounds like he’s African, although he didn’t tell me his country. It’s kind of a general question. The question is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“If someone comes from a bloodline that has a curse upon it, such as spirit causing death within a family, how does one free someone from this cursed bloodline, or lift the entire curse altogether? Is prayer and meditation the key, or is this a destined actuality that cannot be changed?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This can be changed; although this may be slow to change, as there were some changes within the cells, within the particular cells along the blood moving through the bodies of these individuals which has now moved into about sixteen individuals in different parts, in different bodies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">They, in the moving through their lives and the relying and dependency upon their body, it has given their mental outlook a twist, for which they are accessing in their life. The curse is within the blood of these individuals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">They access this, which gives a distortion to their interactions, particularly with their close family members, as with other people they damp it out. It is there and so within their family members it expresses itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, because the members of the family do not really deserve it, except, they have chosen to be born into that bloodline.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We see: we move to that particular individual, as we do honor free will. We see that you, as an individual, can clear it from your own body and from your own blood and from your own future and from the future of relatives descending from you. This can be cleared. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There is a joy in the idea of clearing this, as it has been heavy upon the life of yourself and affecting some others that you are in contact with. We are, as we are speaking, we are working on the clearing of it. There are some other things that ground it into the system and keep it there, such as smoke in the vicinity of your body.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We suggest—we are speaking slowly, because we are working with that, with yourself—we do not clear it from the other members as they are not asking. You may sense it as we are speaking, moving in and out; you may be able to look within yourself and see the particular frequency of this and to look to change it to a different frequency.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Being at a different frequency, it can no longer affect you as it has been and can have less hold, and can move out of your body. We suggest you listen to this and work with moving it out of your body and changing that frequency.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Next question; this is from Dave:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Is it possible to save our country, or should we prepare for troubled times ahead?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We say the answer may be both. It is possible to save the country and to prepare for troubled times ahead. There are categories of trouble.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">One of them is economic situations, where the government has gotten itself into a great trouble economically. One of the things is to find politicians that are service-to-others and to see what they are saying and to take a look at their history and what they have voted for; find the ones that you feel will bring the brightest future to the country.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Other categories are such things as climate change. As the solar system moves through one of the arms of the galaxy and thus heats up and is having more heat moving into not only earth but other of the planets in the solar system, this can create melting of the glaciers. This can create, then, climate change, so one needs to keep track of this. It can bring difficulties into certain parts of the world. Those are two different areas that can be difficult.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">So, we do not make predictions; things that something cannot be changed and is headed for a bad course. We see the signs and we pay attention; however, from our standpoint, outcomes can be changed. It depends upon the number of people and the intention of the people that are working toward the change or asking for the change, or praying for the change.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">That is our answer.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Would you say that if we had a quantum leap in the number of people listening to our calls that would be a big step in creating trajectories for more positive outcomes?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Here’s my favorite question of the day which I think I’m going to answer:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Please let me know how I can repay all of you for your selfless and loving work. With Divine love and peace, that’s from Ann Johnson.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We have a little thing on our website called donations.intelligent-infinity.com, even little small amounts.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Next question: I’ll answer one question here, from Darryl:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Can you share any information on disappearance of people, especially children, from national parks in wilderness areas?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>How can we keep them safe?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I can’t say how we can keep them safe; you’d have to ask that again.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I say that the negative tends to abduct children and they have horrible outcomes. That happens not just in national parks. I don’t want to say anything more about that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There are also problems with animals in national parks, so do not leave your children unattended when you are in a national park. Keep them within your eye-shot, as even a small lapse can create an opportunity for an animal to come in.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This is a question about the Carla Rueckert readings. You may have heard me mention Carla Rueckert. She’s a guest approximately once a month on our Monday night calls. Her work is foundational for the work we’re doing. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In 1981, she had a voice come through her called Ra. For three years<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>her partner asked, all these questions to the Ra group and got answers. They were published under “Ra, the Law of One.” They’re available on her website for free: <i>llresearch.org</i>. If it wasn’t for Carla Rueckert’s work, there wouldn’t be a David Wilcock, most likely and there wouldn’t be us doing this.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">She is a very highly-intended, loving channel. She did her channelings under quite a bit of rigor to keep it positive. Just for the note, we don’t ask her to say “Wynn is channeling Ra, or the Elohim.” Although she has said in terms of Terry, she’s heard Terry’s work more than Daphne’s lately; she said she trusts Terry’s tuning.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Carla Rueckert, in her channelings, was getting very negatively attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She had a way of tuning with putting various spiritual items above her head, care of her body, sometimes even instructions for placement of her hair. She was told that doing all those admonitions for correct placement were required to bring in the Ra group at that time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The person who is Don Hanson, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Superior</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wisconsin</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">. I think it’s Donna, but she or Don Hanson. The question is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">That doesn’t seem to be as great an issue with the three of you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Why is this?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. It is in accordance with Terry’s tuning, that we speak only for Terry here.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The locking-in of the home frequency of the Elohim and combined with the Ra group is very strong. We are able to lock in, through the crown chakra and down into the head and even lower, and to couple with Terry, in that she has worked very hard on herself to eliminate her <span style="color: black;">spurious</span> frequencies. She can hold a frequency very well; she has very little mind chatter, and this one of the reasons.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When Carla channels and has the exact placement of the hair and the things about her, this brings a grounding and a reference point and stability for the bringing in of the Ra energies and the<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: blue;"> </span></b><span style="color: black;">‘Quo’</span> energies. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">With Terry, we lock in with the physical body around the head, the hair and down into the brain area; down into the vocal cords. If one looks very carefully at Terry [while channeling], you can see around the outside of her head, you can see characters, geometrical structures, small geometrical structures, that are part of the linking and the grounding; you might even say ‘docking’, of our energies with Terry.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><br /><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span> Thank you. I’m going to ask just one more question, on behalf of Michael Adler in southern</span> <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">California</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Do our Sources see as possible a large movement of the population of southern</span> <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">California</span> <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">out of the state, due to environmental hazards, such as Fukushima Nuclear Reactor disaster worsening? Perhaps we should say earthquakes; any other reason. Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span> That is a potential that would not occur until the actuality of something very tangible appearing, as people would not leave unless there was something very demonstrably tangible. But, we do not, at this time, predict that for at least a few years. We do not wish to predict it even after, as it is not written until it is written.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span> Thank you. Do you have any closing comments before we close out this session?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span> We, in a way, are speechless at the response of each and every one to the calls. It brings tears to our energy eyes to make this connection and it is profoundly meaningful to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span> Adonai</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Just remember, everyone who is listening, that we are doing a four hour call like this, three to four hours, as long as we can stand it and we’ll be answering loads and loads of questions this Saturday morning at</span> <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">10:00 a.m.</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span> Go to the website and look up ‘Coast Special’ and its there. If you already bought our four-hour workshop for $10, I’ll be sending an email where you can upgrade that for $5 more to attend this Saturday session.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span> Can you explain how they can get onto the Saturday session?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span> They’ll get on exactly like they got on this call; but, it will be a unique number, which I’ll email everybody. If you don’t get that email by Friday night, email me; make sure. We’ll see what’s wrong. Check your spam folders because you’ll get an email with the number for the Saturday session.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We send blessings to all of you; let’s all of us send blessings to our entire planet. Let’s take a moment of silence; bring in the connection. All those of you who need healing, take a moment and ask; lift your energies up. All of you that want to send energy to someone send it right now. I’ll take that moment of silence.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Thank you for reminding me Gijs.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Silence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span> A long pause…</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I hope to see many of you on our Sunday call; if you like the feeling of the energies on this call, the Sunday call is our strongest call with feeling the energies. We do processes and visualizations to bring the energies in. We call that personal and planetary healing session. If you like this call, you’ll like that call.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Watch your email, or you can also go to <i>conference.intelligent-infinity.com</i>, those of you who keep missing calls because it’s last minute. I send it out an hour or a half hour before the call. Again, our call schedule is listed on the website: <i>conference.intelligent-infinity.com</i>. Or, just go into <i>intelligent-infinity.com</i> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to menu and you’ll see one of the links at the top that says conference and you’ll get the schedule of our three calls.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If you’re feeling energies, if you’re feeling a shift while you’re listening today and you start listening, you’ll start integrating these energies. On that note, I’m going to un-mute everybody. Here we go.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You’re all un-muted, and we’ll see you later.</span></p>
