<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Good morning everybody, this is <st1:date year="2013" day="14" month="4" w:st="on">April 14, 2013</st1:date> and it is our Sunday grid healing. Those of you that are on the call for the first time, this is kind of like an- energy train. It’s hard to describe exactly what it is and this whole call has evolved. Our Sunday call has evolved over a period of a few years where it started out kind of as an experiment in connecting with the energies of higher dimensions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We all have the idea, those of you that are showing up and lots of people that don’t show up that never even heard about us, that there’s something out there that we can’t see that wants to help us, that’s positive, that has great power, great Love and that many people have had some kind of experience with that something out there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Historically people might call that ‘God’ except when it comes down to really figuring out who God is or what God is, there’s a mystery. We usually just accept it on faith and say, “O<i>kay I know this works but I don’t understand it</i>,” i.e. maybe you have a prayer and you ask something inwardly and something magically transforms. Or maybe you have a synchronicity where something comes into your life that looks like coincidence but it was beyond coincidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You say, “<i>H</i><i>ow could that have happened?” </i>Then it starts processing in your thinking, because I used to have many, many of those occurrences happen for me. And I was in a constant dialogue with myself saying, “<i>H</i><i>ow could that happen,”</i> because it was impossible? I remember saying, “W<i>ell this must be God bringing in something to me.” </i>Now you know it is okay to use the word God. Because if you say the word God and you ask for something with the right intent, you can get the same results. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But what’s happened in our group and in our experiences is we have discovered a new way of understanding that principle that is commonly referred to as God. We’ve learned - now when I say we’ve learned this, I’m drawing conclusions and you may not have come to these conclusions yet, this is why it’s important to study our materials. Because what we’re sharing is not just something to believe in or here’s the way God works, or a dogma or a new religious system. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because the stuff we’re sharing is grounded in real experience, in present time. Many things that couldn’t happen and many things that are validated in very unusual ways that it’s hard to just discard them and say <i>there’s nothing to it</i>. There has to be something to it. It starts off with voices that talk to people and people that are able to tap-in that have the unique ability to tap-in to other realms - other dimensions - other timelines and communicate with an intelligence that’s beyond their own intelligence, not from their own consciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Either they’re really doing that … there has to be an explanation. Where are these voices coming from? Are these people crazy? In a normal world many people would immediately not even look at it, they would discard it and say <i>this person needs to see a therapist.</i> [Laughter] The thing about it is, what are these voices doing? They’re answering questions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So now, people are posing questions and this intelligence that’s speaking, seeming intelligence, is answering questions that, from most of us there would be no answer to. I couldn’t answer these questions; I mean we’ve asked questions in our sessions like, <i>“How</i><i> did you create the Universe?” </i>And this intelligence answers. And, “<i>H</i><i>ow do you work with us?” [They say] “We project Love Light into your realm from our dimension.”</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And that on these calls and when I do live talks, many people feel that energy in the room and it’s an extraordinary thing. It’s an unusual feeling. Now some people feel that when they go to church. Some people feel that when they go to spiritual groups. But in most of those cases they’re feeling the energy but there is not the opportunity to communicate with the intelligences that are consciously, apparently, choosing to project those energies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">That’s what’s really unusual about these meetings because we are in ongoing conversations, we’re feeling the energies and we’re in conversations/dialogues hearing messages from these Sources that say they’re projecting this energy. That’s pretty darned amazing to be in the middle of that experience and this has been going on for years. It’s been a developing, ongoing thing for me; it’s been a learning experience because I’ve never – how would I say it? [Laughter] I’ve never been trained to do this. I don’t even know where to read about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So it’s like learning by doing and seeing what works; hearing the experience from all the people that are on this line. Because it’s not like a live session where I’m in a room and I can look at people and I can see the expressions on their face and I can even see the energy in the room. Because you’re all invisible, I can’t see you. But I most definitely can feel you. Now it took me awhile to know that what I was feeling was <i>you</i>. [Laughter] <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It’s like if you’re coming into this call, it can take you awhile to draw the conclusions that what you’re feeling is the way I’m describing it. Everyone has free will to develop their own understanding in their own way for what happens here. There’s nothing to believe in, there’s nothing to belong to. We’re not selling things. We’re not selling the opportunity to come here, we do sell things. But these calls are offered freely in-service to all of you and to our planet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We are really lucky because this is not only about <i>me </i>doing this - we have two people on the call who have the experience of being the mouthpiece for these intelligences we’re talking about. I don’t know if Daphne’s on the call; if she is there’s three people. But you know, in looking at it all, and as this is unfolding for me and when I was just in a little room with a tape recorder asking questions and getting this intelligence to answer those questions, and I kept saying to myself <i>can this be real?</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Are they who they say they are? What am I supposed to do with this? Will it make a difference for other people?</span></i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> Because the scary part for me was, you put it out and suddenly it would become - how would I say it? Some kind of cult or everyone would have a lot of expectation from me and that I would be exalted and I didn’t want to be exalted, I wanted to be myself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It took me awhile to learn how to do it and just be me. I think we’ve all had to learn that. Terry’s had to learn that; Carla’s had to learn it. Because it was scary that when you put this out, if it is what we’re saying it is, then it’s a pretty phenomenal thing to be occurring in the world. And it’s pretty amazing to be the focal point of the delivery system of this - into the world. Even though that’s true, that we’re the focal points for this, I’m still human. We’re all human and how are we going to deal with our human side when everyone thinks we’re someone special? You see, it’s a paradox.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So it’s very interesting because in the past month or so, I’ve been traveling and I like to travel and I like to meet people. And you know, in the past I’ve traveled with Terry and Terry had lots to do and we didn’t have enough money to do it together and so I stayed in <st1:place w:st="on">North Hollywood</st1:place>. For someone that’s in our group that had an apartment building that had empty apartments and had said you can stay in my unit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">What I found was - when I was around people that I always had amazing things to share and offer just being in their environments. You know, I was perceptive. It wasn’t like I was on a pedestal - I was just like offering points of view from my perspective and I think I can say one thing about myself, is that I see things deeply. I see the patterns in things and it’s probably - I’ve had a lot of experience in this realm. And that for a good portion of my life I saw things deeply and the way I dealt with that was I wrote music and poems and put my perceptions out in that way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When I started traveling around, I started playing music, sometimes, for people. You know, I realize that the whole thing about all my expression was - it was for people. It wasn’t for becoming famous, it wasn’t for making money. Although you could become famous and make money, the great joy was in the sharing on a human level and feeling the energy and being able to say things that helped people feel comfortable in being themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I know Carla as the channel for the Ra material - I thought I’d just let her share her experience because I’m sure that as it started to move out, people looked up to her, put her on a pedestal - I’m pretty sure - and how she dealt with that and how she’s come around. This is like you know 33 years since her first Ra session and how she and I, we both have this penchant for being human and that makes us very good when we do things together. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because when we can be human, you can be human. We’re all human! We’re all stuck here in these bodies and we can have a joyous experience but we’re still in bodies. Carla, you want to share anything about that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Well I … [Laughter] excuse me I had my microphone out of the way so I wouldn’t be breathing into it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I guess it ceased to be a problem for me about I don’t know, 30 years ago because I realized that if people just knew me for awhile they would realize that I was human. Because I mean all they’d have to do was read <i>Book Five</i> and they’d see me struggling with this and struggling with that because I write about that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It had been a problem around the turn of the century. In the house - I had a whole bunch of people come at once that wanted to be part of <i>L &amp; L Research</i> and wanted to serve and they were very high minded and beautiful people and I was finding the pedestal there and it was not necessary at all, it was in the way. So I made them watch the movie that I made in ’72 where I played a topless role and in a cheap blonde wig and shoes that were too big for me and no blouse and that pretty much did it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The aviator sunglasses, the cheap wig, me wobbling off my feet, acting poorly - [Laughter] I only had about two hours to practice this role so that’s the only time that I ever had to really work on it and it was quickly done. I just showed them the movie and after that there couldn’t possibly be a pedestal for somebody who had done that movie. [Laughter] <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I think that we show our humanity so quickly, so clearly, so obviously that just any time in knowing the person, any length of time that you spend knowing the person, and you begin to see that the person has her faults. Then the challenge becomes well, are you going to forgive that person for not being perfect - and that’s not my problem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So you know, just like I said - that I stopped worrying about it about 30 years ago and if any of you have a similar problem, I would say just write it off and remind people if you feel that they need to be reminded, that you’re just a bozo. [Laughter] But for the most part, it becomes obvious so quickly [Laughter] that not much needs to be said. I mean we have to be humble, all of us, because we’re human. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">If we weren’t making mistakes and goofing up and just learning, we wouldn’t be here; you know, this is a school, this is a place to learn. Earth is definitely a school for souls. So you figure, one of the requirements for being here is that you’re going to be making mistakes, otherwise what would you have to learn? So you can feel good and the word here is forgiveness. Just forgive yourself completely anytime that you see that you’re coming up short of your expectations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">There’s nothing wrong with your expectations. Intend to do every bit of those expectations and more. But if you fall short, remember that most of what really is important is your intention. And I’m not saying that that would be what would be important to - say a corporate worker who is judging you. I’m saying that as a spiritual person, working in spirit, working on your soul-walk, you are not in space-time. You’re not in this illusion, you’re in a different illusion and the rules are different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Thoughts are things in time-space and everything that we do here on these programs is actually in time-space. Time doesn’t matter. Age doesn’t matter. What matters about us is our essence and our intentions are a lot of that essential-self. What we intend to do, what we want to do, what we hope to do, what we dream. All of those things are so much more important than keeping some kind of a little report card with gold stars on it if we’ve done this or that perfectly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You know, it’s not about being able to remember a certain number of things on the test. That’s not that kind of test that we’re working towards. We’re working towards a test where you have to know nothing. All you have to do is <i>be</i>. You have to be a person with an open heart. You have to want to help people. You have to want to serve. That’s going to make you pass in this particular test. That’s the test for graduation in service-to-others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The test for service-to-self obviously, is if you’ve managed to live your whole life serving <i>only</i> yourself and none of us here is really trying for that one. The test that we’re trying for, is do you spend over half the time trying to serve others? Or trying to serve the Creator in yourself by tuning yourself up to the best that you can be? That’s the kind of place this is, really. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So, what people think of you, that’s just junk and you can pretty much toss it to one side. Re-member your intentions and re-affirm your intentions. But whatever they are, go back to them because those are the things that are the real you. Not whether you’ve done perfectly on a given day. Just what you <i>intend</i> to do today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: One of the things I notice, I think one of the biggest issues that many people have is a feeling of unworthiness, particularly depending on the kind of parents that you had. Because so often, your parents made you feel not good enough. Now they didn’t know what they were doing and it’s not to judge them and it is okay to forgive them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But to understand that if you were brought up with parents that made you not feel good enough, it’s something you’re going to have to work on, to release. Because the feeling of “<i>not good enough”</i> will just constantly be making you try to please people (“people pleaser”) and when you’re trying to please people that’s different than being of service. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now I wanted to clarify the difference because sometimes when you hear the word being of service, you think, well I’m just going to be really nice and make everybody like me. [Laughter] That’s part of the expression of trying to find the acceptance that you didn’t get with your parents and I speak from my own experience on that because I didn’t get that acceptance from my father, in particular.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">In fact, no matter what I did it was never good enough. And I remember when I was in high school I had developed this protective mechanism in my body where my shoulders were tight and my whole upper body, my heart area was very, very rigid because I was trying [to protect myself from my father]… I didn’t know this at the time, it was just how I felt and thought that’s how it was to be me. But when I look back on it, I can see that I was making all that area rigid to protect myself from my father who probably was psychically attacking me or totally not accepting me and making me not good enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And I was trying to be good enough inside myself without<span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span>energy flowing into the world. You know, when you’re doing that, when that’s happening with you, it’s very hard to have love flow back and forth. Because the area where love flows which is your heart, your chest - is all protected. Then I would feel like that was me. That’s who I was and I would feel unworthy, unacceptable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I was unacceptable because I couldn’t flow energy from my chest and I’m sharing this because I’m sure somebody that’s listening now may identify with that kind of issue and it can seem insurmountable. I <span style="color: #0070c0;">t</span>hought insurmountable for me; even at a certain point I happened to learn the karma that I had with my father. Somebody did a reading for me years and years ago and I know the reading was correct. They explained to me that my father had killed me in another lifetime. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">He poisoned me and that because he had killed me, he was an option to come in and have a life. He owed me a life [Laughter] and there was some kind of karmic obligation. And so on the other side, I chose to take that life. There was some reason to come into that environment in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:city> and take that life and he was available to be the host. It’s a really unusual way of looking at your parents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">One of the things that helped me release this thing with my father was asking myself (knowing all the suffering I had gone through because he was my father, knowing all of that, and looking at all the things I’ve learned in this life, and where I’m standing right now, if I had to re-make that choice of taking that person to be the person who would give me life this lifetime) would I make that choice right now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The answer would be, absolutely. Once I did that, once I re-chose my father even in spite of all the difficulties, it really helped me forgive him and master this issue of lack of self worth. So when you feel unworthy, realize that that’s not who you really are, it’s an overlay and very likely from your parents and maybe from other lifetimes as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But as I came to understand this, my own feeling was, because there’s a certain amount of free will choice when you choose parents, when you choose a parent who ends up really difficult for you, when you realize you’ve made the choice at some point to let that person be your parent, it makes it a lot easier to accept all the difficulties. Terry, anything you want to share on all this that we’re talking about?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yes, my mother was very, very gifted and she was really a great artist and a great architect and she was very difficult though. She didn’t know quite how to handle everything that was going on in her life. She’d taken on a great deal. I learned in growing up - it’s like some of the things that were presented to me where extraordinarily difficult - and I learned however, it’s like in the getting together of all the information about my past track and what happened, it’s like it was a perfect place for me to be growing up with my mother that allowed me to learn lessons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">That was a perfect school for me to learn. One of the biggest things I learned was to not feel like I was just automatically entitled to everything and it made me humble. And I saw that it was the perfect place for me to grow up to learn those lessons, although it was really, really difficult. Then once I forgave my mother for her being so difficult, all of a sudden all of the gifts that I wanted to achieve with being in this lifetime with her, all of the gifts of friendship … it all opened up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now I’m able to have those gifts and I’m able to forgive her totally which eliminated all of the resentments that I had and now I’m able to acknowledge all of those tremendous gifts that she gave by virtue of my being around her. So indeed, it is a school. It’s been very valuable lessons that I will carry on and so I wouldn’t choose a different mother now, either. I would have chosen her again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: You know what, this is an interesting topic and I didn’t know this was what we were going to be talking about and I’ll bet you some of you are thinking <i>this relates to me.</i> Now this is where I really stick my foot in my mouth because I’ll say “<i>D</i><i>oes anyone want to share their own experience about this,”</i> and then no one will come on [Laughter] and I’ll say, “Jeez, wrong topic.” [Laughter] <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But I’ll take the risk and see if any of you are thinking that this relates to you and want to share about your connection with your parents or a feeling of unworthiness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">One of the things when you’re dealing with unworthiness and I say, “<i>O</i>kay, <i>why don’t you share something</i>,” there’s a little voice that goes on inside your head that says, “<i>N</i><i>obody’s going to be interested in anything I have to say.” </i>You see, this is an opportunity to push through that voice and say something because it’s an exercise in pushing yourself over your unworthy feelings and talking and suddenly finding out that when you step in the middle of the ring … see we have a lot of energy here and there’s a lot of attention in your way. What’s amazing is that when you walk into that energy … yes it’s fearful, even for me, I do it pretty effortlessly now - but I know that when I started doing these talks it was nowhere near as easy as it is now. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because, let’s face it, when you talk publicly everyone’s going to hear you. If you really look dumb, you’re going to think that “O<i>h my God I look dumb in front of hundreds of people and now they’re going to remember me.” </i>So the thing about it is when you really step into the energy and you start talking and that energy comes to you, then your experience ends up being of service to other people who are having similar experiences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And not only are you blessing them, you’re blessing yourself and you give yourself the experience that you really do have something to share and suddenly when you’re in that experience you’re not feeling unworthy any more. You see, it’s a way of stepping through your unworthiness, pushing your limits. And on that note, we’ll see if anyone has anything to say. [Laughter] I’ll try un-muting everybody and see if there’s too much noise on the line. Hang on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

And somewhere along the way I realized that your children are your gift and when you have children, we were programmed to believe that we are supposed to teach our children things and that we’re supposed to make them into what we think they’re supposed to be, for society and I don’t think it’s really like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And you know with my parents and you’re having that conversation about how we received the gift of having the parents that we had, I don’t think we put it that way, but we all can, I think, admit that even though our parents gave us a lot of experiences to grow and to get through some of the most challenging things in our life, we don’t seem to regret what we’ve been through because they made us who we are. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Then I see that translating now because I have children. I don’t want to create that same feeling for my kids although I don’t think I have a choice. Because I think that no matter how I show up, they’re going to see it differently because they’re just different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Marsha</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Hi. I just want to thank you for what you shared because it is so pertinent. One thing recently that I’ve been going through is seeing a pattern, not only with my parents, but with all my relationships through my life. And one of the things was somehow I felt very responsible for taking care of people instead of allowing them to find their way. I realized that the problematic people are catalysts because they force you to say, “What am I doing? Why isn’t this working? What is this all about?” So that is, to me, the gift. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">They are your greatest teachers because you can’t let it go until you figure it out and forgive yourself and forgive them and realize you had a part in that. You know, that they may have been misguided in what they were doing to achieve a goal with you that you were incapable of doing for them. So you really helped very much. [Laughter] I just want to thank you. You have alot of insight into these things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Marsha</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Well, you have a lot of good things to say. So you’re not boring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Well, thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Marsha</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: And one other thing, I heard you on a radio program and I thought, “<i>Oh my God, this guy, he knows what he’s talking about</i>.” Because I’ve been in healing for a long time, working with people all my life and I started meditating after that. Just on my own and I felt this presence of these two beings. I call them the emissaries of the Elohim or the God … [Laughter] I don’t know who they are but they’re really incredible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And so many things that were blocked to me—they don’t erase things, they say “Here, look at this. That’s not true. That is not your truth. This is who you are. You know you’re a child of the infinite Source, whatever in that way.” So it’s been very helpful and I truly appreciate you and I’m so glad I heard you on that radio show. So I’m a first timer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Marsha</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yeah, I already requested that he do that because to me, this is so vital.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Let’s make up aliens, let’s make up all kinds of stuff … “O<i>h my God, oh my God, where are they coming from, who’s going to get me</i>,” is so counterproductive.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Because a lot of women start - obviously, historically women have been oppressed. They have been oppressed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Marsha</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Sure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: And they’ve been held in boxes … that the reason they’ve been oppressed is because - this is what’s coming off the top of my head, this may not be the ultimate truth - but the feminine power to receive is actually so (I don’t want to use the word controlling but) fulfilling to a man. And the nature of the receptive - it doesn’t mean every woman has to be receptive because everyone has a different balance regardless of their bodysuit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Whether they’re a man or a woman inside them, they have a different balance of feminine and masculine. And as people get more enlightened, they become more of both and they can step into a situation and exhibit the energy that’s most appropriate for that situation. So you know, they could be more assertive or more receptive. But so many women …<o:p></o:p></span></p>

But my story is that several years ago I took a workshop and during the workshop I asked a question to try and resolve a situation, an ongoing situation, in my life with my daughter and my son-in-law. And I have known my son-in-law Scott for 29 years and in the 29 years he has changed from being one who could always make me laugh at the slightest thing to becoming very mean and vengeful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And through Wynn from Terry’s message, I learned that Scott and my daughter Nancy and I had had a former life together and that it ended very badly with Scott possessing <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nancy</st1:place></st1:city> and killing me and that now in the current carnation that we are going through, that my life was in danger. This was the message from Wynn. This was over four years ago and I took the information as another piece of the puzzle. But I did go ahead and continue to put myself in individuation and it did cost me my life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Not in a way that I would ever imagine but the continued stress caused me to develop severe Bell’s palsy and a major massive heart attack for which I have a short time to go on in this life which is okay with me. But I find it quite interesting that even though the message was an answer to why everything was the way it was (where am I going here?) it gave me at least some peace in knowing that it wasn’t just me that was causing the situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And now interestingly enough, Scott, his whole life is starting to disintegrate because of his actions that have motivated him throughout his life. So my prayers are that he will find the answers for whatever the deep hurt is in him that causes him to be so angry and so stressed out because he is so very, very loved. And I thank Wynn and Terry for giving me the message just to give me some peace in what was causing me and has caused me a complete change in my life and my quality of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Thank you. Could we take a moment and just send a positive intention otherwise known as a prayer, in your direction, as a group?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Let’s do that. Let’s just send <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Frances</st1:place></st1:country-region> and ask our Sources to work with her and any kind of releases for her health that for the highest good that might happen for her. Let’s take a moment of silence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Let’s do our group … let’s do our personal tuning-in part of the call and on this part of the call (wait a second; can you hear me?) …<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yes Wynn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Okay, thank you, alright. You know the ongoing idea that we started talking about years ago was <i>The Law of One</i>, i.e. the whole Universe is one-energy and that we, as humans, have separated ourselves from that energy. We don’t usually experience ourselves, most humans, as being part of <i>All That Is.</i> We don’t experience ourselves as being part of God, part of the Universe and we don’t experience ourselves as being part of each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We feel estranged and we feel lonely and we feel misunderstood and that we take this moment of a personal way to experience, not believe, but experience how big we can be. How our potential is a child of the Universe and that our feelings of separation are a temporary illusion that we go through while we’re in these physical embodiments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The pervading message of the Ra Group is <i>The Law of One</i>. The whole Universe is one being. One being and, I sometimes use the analogy of our body being a model of the Universe and all these billions of cells make up our body and then there’s group cells that makes up our brain and our heart and they form and they create sub-structures in our body and the Universe is similar. We are all tiny cells making up the body of humanity, and the body of Earth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">As you move up through dimensions, the separations start to become less distinct. It’s like when people are in love, the separations are not distinct. They are each other. You know, when people are in love - they’re truly in love - then they create a loving energy in the people around them … the idea that everybody loves a lover. So we’re going to do a little exercise and we’re going to become one with the Universe right now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Just follow my voice, if you feel comfortable doing that. And if you’re checking us out and anything feels uncomfortable, just say <i>I’m</i> <i>not going to go with that and I’ll see how I feel later.</i> Or hang up [Laughter] if you’re really uncomfortable but most people love this because they feel a transformation. And they feel the reality of letting their patterns go away - they’ve held them in check - and feeling their expansion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So let’s start off and take a few deep breaths. Like breathe in … breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. When you breathe out, go [Sound of exhale] and let all the stress out. [Breathing in and exhaling] Now, the Universe is alive. Everything in it is alive and we’re going to start out with the Earth which is alive and is underneath us. Every one of us, no matter where we are right now, has the planet Earth underneath us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The planet, not only is it alive, but it’s aware and it knows we’re here. Most often, we don’t know Earth is here. [Laughter] Most humans operate as if the Earth is not alive and yet it’s called Mother Earth because she is our host. So let’s see that energy of the Earth - imagine the Earth’s energy extending through the floor and into our feet. You might notice a tingling. Let’s, in our minds, tell the Earth we love her; let’s send her gratitude for hosting us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Let’s ask her for protection. I do believe the Earth makes decisions. To a certain degree the Earth can decide to have an earthquake or not have an earthquake, or have a quiet earthquake. I think there are certain things that have to happen because the Earth has decided to move to another dimension or a higher dimension which is causing it to shift. But if you love the Earth, then you might engender some extra protection, just because no one likes to create hurt for someone they love.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So we tell the Earth, we love her. We move the Earth’s energy up through our legs, our thighs, our calves, our solar plexus, our chest, our neck and into our head. So we have this finger of energy going through the Earth, through our floor and into our bodies and we are connected to the Earth. Of course, we’re always connected but we’re feeling the connection. Then we move through the top of our head and let’s imagine ourselves being above our head. Feel the shift in your energy? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Let’s go up to the ceiling. Let’s surround our entire room with this energy, almost as if those pictures you see with people with chakras and lights coming out the top of their head. Just see that energy from the top of your head, moving through your entire room and surrounding you. So now, you’re still your body, you’re still the energy of the Earth and you’re the room.<span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span>Can you feel that? Now we’re going to move through the ceiling and through the roof and we’re going to be in the sky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We are not leaving our body, we’re all places simultaneously. We’re not astral traveling. We’re just expanding and our energy is moving through the sky, through the clouds, through timelines, through our past lives and we come to a place where we started. There was a time when we did not exist as an individuated entity. All time exists simultaneously and if all time exists simultaneously - that’s at the higher levels of it - then we can move to just at that point where we first individuated and we had no awareness other than we were there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Each of us had that experience. We didn’t exist - we were part of some huge energy field that was <i>All That Is</i> but we were not a separated part and then we separated. We can all be on that edge of that and experience the blending that we can all have, together. So, right at this moment, for those of you that feel comfortable going along with this, we move into the place of touching each other’s energies, being in that point of first birthing and the innocence of becoming aware that we exist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">All of these other beings that are on this call are sharing that same awareness. We can feel the brotherhood connecting us all. We can feel the love. Just as we said to the Earth <i>we love you</i>, let’s say to each of us here and each of you listening to the replay of these calls, <i>we love you</i>. Now we have these group souls and we have the Elohim and we have the Ra Group and they are all part of the same Oneness, at a very high level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Let’s ask them to join this group energy. If you take a quick check on your body, you may notice how it feels different. Notice the difference as we connect with the celestial high Sources and to the Earth. And we’re still connected to the Earth. What’s happening is our body is the intermediary point between heaven and Earth, between the high and the low. We can bring this energy back down, through all the dimensions, through the sky and through our body from the top of our head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Just move it down like a wonderful golden globe from the top of your head, to your neck, to your chest. See it purifying and healing all your distortions. You know we’ve gone to the place where you first became aware that you were an individuated being. You were pure. You had no distortions. You had no experience.&nbsp; But you knew you existed and then you had all these experiences that modified that first innocence. Now we are moving into the first innocence and moving it through all the experiences and all the damage that’s been done to you and all the beautiful things that have been done to you - all the many, many lifetimes of experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And we’re moving that innocence through us to release all that you wish was not there, for the highest good. You can see how, in some belief patterns, they would call this a rebirth, a cleansing, a purification. Move it through your body and just let go of the things that are oppressing you. Surround your heart and see what’s in there that you can’t forgive and forgive it. See the resentments, let them go. You don’t have to hold on to the past anymore. This is a rebirth, in this very moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">As you keep coming into our calls or play these calls or even taking your own moments to do this meditation every day, you start to anchor this energy. We move it through your legs and into the Earth. Now you can feel your tiny little body in the midst of this great energy, this great expansion and get this sense of how large you are. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We’re going to have a message come through Terry. Or actually, <b>before we do that, let me just look at our healing list for today</b> and just realize that if you’re on this list, use this power for the highest good for transformation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Teresa - go start playing at convalescent homes and old age homes and put it out. Don’t worry about fame and fortune. Put it out so it lifts people’s spirits and learn how that works. Get confidence in yourself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And if we didn’t read you, we didn’t say it out loud and you’re on the list - that, whether it’s on the list or not, we’re in the Oneness of the Universe. We have support from beings at the top of the scale that are watching us and listening to you. So hold the thought in your mind of the things that you would like to change, to heal, to become, to fix.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Wynn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yeah.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I want you to know that Daphne joined in earlier …<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Okay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: And also, your console has dropped out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Okay. Gijs I want you to know that I’m on McDonald’s Wi-Fi [Laughter<span style="color: #0070c0;">] it </span>only lasts for two hours and they dropped me out. So keep an eye on things ‘til I get back on. Thank you and hello, Daphne, thank you for being here. Let’s call in the Light and then we’ll have a message from Terry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> to surround and protect every person on this line, every person on the replay; and any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet Earth, through our bodies and into the center of the Earth. And right now, we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls; and we invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, operating in the Christed energies to join with us. We create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave <i>now</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And we want to ask in particular that our planet be given time, if possible to let this work proliferate, to let all Light work proliferate and protection from those things that would put us into havoc, particularly the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region> situation. Thank you, I’m glad to be of service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Ra’An/Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator. This is <st1:date year="2013" day="14" month="4" w:st="on">the 14<sup>th</sup> of April 2013</st1:date> and we impart Love to each and every person that wishes to receive it. We take a moment and we look at the world. And we see that the world, many people in the world, which then creates an overriding consensus, nervousness, a feeling of being on edge, but not knowing and not having enough information and this is felt over a large portion of the West and the East.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We take a moment and we believe the words may be to <i>chill out?</i> To just take a moment and observe the nervousness, observe the tension. Also, as you are doing this, realize that this tension adds at a subconscious level to your life, to the things that you are doing. Even if you aren’t following the news there is this overriding tension in the atmosphere. We take a moment and we work with that tension. We follow it to its source and we work with the energies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We take a moment and work with the energies to help to dissolve the tension, the distortion that is added to people’s life by such tension in their vicinity. So realize that if things are difficult for you right now, it is being made more difficult by the adding-on of those tensions that are in the vicinity, of part of the Earth. Not all of the Earth but of part of the Earth at this time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">As we view this, we deal with the tensions and we take them to the higher realms and we … there are no words in the English language for what we do. We transmute them to the degree that they are available to be transmuted. We put our frequency and our Love there, that to whatever degree individuals are open they can receive it and help them in their own centering and in their own balance so they can handle whatever tensions are coming their way at this time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We take a moment of silence as we work with these energies and with individuals who are reaching and searching and asking. One of the things that we do is slow down the creation as it has been created of tension so that it can be worked with and released. We have no words for much of what we do. We have tried at times to convey the mathematical equations that are used in doing conversions and these are the same conversions that are stair-stepped from the 3<sup>rd</sup> density to the 4<sup>th</sup> density to the 5<sup>th</sup>, the 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We simply bring these stair-steps, the mathematical geometrical conversions into the sphere that for inner energies that are available to be transmuted and for people that are reaching for this that these tensions can be eased. We realize that there are dangers and we do not wish to transmute any real time sense of how one should protect oneself and operate successfully in the 3<sup>rd</sup> density. So it is not a sweetness and Light transmutation. It is a real time transmutation of what can be transmuted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We Love each and every one of you and you are a vital part of the raising of the consciousness of your realm and thus raising the consciousness into all of the higher realms. We are available for assistance directly for those of you that ask. It is hard to sense us at times as one’s focus in the 3<sup>rd</sup> density plays upon the frequencies, the energies, the relevance’s<span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span>within the 3<sup>rd</sup> density and we are not within the 3<sup>rd</sup> density except to be there at a very high frequency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So if you find it hard to sense us, do not worry, we are there and if you ask we will hear. We send our Love. We impart our Love to each and every one of you. And we will continue working to transmit/transmute energies where it can be done to the highest most loving. We are not taking control we are only helping when it is asked for and if anything does not resonate with you, of what we have said then disregard it as not being applicable to you at this time. We leave but we do not leave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Thank you very much and thank you Terry. And we’re going to just go into our planetary part of this session but just before we do, I just thought I’d invite Daphne to say hello if she wants to and for those that are not aware, Daphne was the person that probably catalyzed all of this and it’s why we’re doing this today. She was the person that started bringing through messages in 2002 with me and initiated this potential for this work we’re doing right now. Are you there Daphne?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I am here, Wynn. Thank you. Thank you, Terry for bringing in that message.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Thank you for being here and thank all of you for being here. If you’re getting this idea because of the nature of the fact that we need to ask for something to happen and that each of you is part of the asking and that as a group we multiply our power many, many, many times by being a-group energy and working with the group energies of our Sources and we’re going to take the position of being this group right now, this group energy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And we’re going to look at our planet Earth. Of course, we are one with our planet - we are one with everything on it. But we are moving back from the Oneness so that we can do cosmic acupuncture of the Earth. Through our intentions we can move our group energy and we see ourselves surrounding the Earth with this loving energy. Of course, there are areas where we can’t move into those areas because they’re blocked by what we might call the negative. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">They’re in control of it and yet there are many other areas where we can move through. We see this energy surrounding the Earth, moving closer and closer to the surface of the Earth. Moving around any obstacles and finding those people on our planet who are reaching upwards, who are reaching for God - who are what we sometimes call Lightworkers or Indigo children or <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Crystal</st1:place></st1:city> children. And they don’t understand, sometimes, why they’re here. Some of them do, some of them don’t.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But they know they don’t fit-in in normal ways. Many of them are learning to interface with others out of compassion and out of caring and we touch them and surround them. They are the seeds. There are multimillions of them on the planet. Some of them are awake and some of them are potentials. Some of you were those people with potentials. They are becoming more and more awake. We see the energy expanding and we envision a world of people who care.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And we direct this energy around the Ring of Fire, focusing it where there’s this great earthquake potential. We ask the Earth to work with us and where earthquakes need to occur, they might occur in small eruptions and away from population centers. We know that tension needs to be released. We see this energy moving from the tip of <st1:place w:st="on">South America</st1:place>, up the western coast of <st1:place w:st="on">South America</st1:place>, up to <st1:place w:st="on">Central America</st1:place>, up through <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Remember, we’re talking about the Ring of Fire which is all those land masses surrounding the <st1:place w:st="on">Pacific Ocean</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We see the energy moving into <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:state>, <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place></st1:city>, up the coast, <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>, and all the areas around <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:city> which have potential for earthquakes. Up through Malibu and the Pacific coast and Half Moon Bay, where Daphne is, and South San Francisco and the western coast of California, through Oregon, through Portland, Mt. Hood, through Washington, through Seattle, Vancouver, up the western coast of Canada.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We project this energy and we project it through the Earth, underground, through the western coast of Canada, across the southern coast of Alaska, down the eastern coast of Russia, down through China, Singapore, Hong Kong; Japan. We see this energy surrounding Fukushima and any balancing/reduction of radiation that can be done - we ask that it be done; down through Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand and all the areas in the Pacific Ocean, all the islands including Hawaii.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We go to the center of the country and we have <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St. Louis</st1:place></st1:city>, the New Madrid fault surrounding five states. We see the area all the way down to the <st1:place w:st="on">Gulf of Mexico</st1:place>. Now we’re just really powerful. We’re just sending Love beams, Love Light beams into those areas - the eastern seaboard, the Mid-Atlantic fault, the same thing; the Canary Islands, the same thing and all those other places around the world that have that potential for earthquakes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We send this Light beneath the surface of the Earth. And we work in Love with the Earth as we do this. While we’re surrounding the planet let’s ask for rain in those areas where there’s drought, where it’s affecting the food supply. We send this energy for transmutation of things like Chemtrails, the toxins in Chemtrails that are affecting people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We send this energy to the country of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region> and its leadership for compassion and balance, for all those things that are interplaying on our planet right now. The Chinese stepping forward and trying to work out this problem, we ask for understanding and compassion. We ask for solutions and we ask for the transmutation of any hate that people have for what they perceive as threats and enemies because hate only polarizes the issue. Take a moment of silence on that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We ask for interventions, we ask that no nuclear weapon be allowed to go off on our planet. We ask that all those people in position of leadership and power be open to compassion. We ask that each one of you can learn to walk in the awareness, that you are part of <i>All That Is</i>. That you are a walking prayer, that in your ability individually, to hold these energies you can lift your own personal geographical place. You can impact many, many people just by holding this energy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And, that we thank you all so much for being here and being part of this grand experiment in the transformation of planet Earth. And we bring ourselves, some of you that are going to continue to hold this space and if you’re in a space, don’t rush off and talk to people and don’t call somebody up. Hold the space for awhile. Many of you have noticed how fast time moves when you’re on this call. How fast two hours goes by. Time is moving fast because you are accessing other dimensions where time moves at different speeds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It’s a reference point for how it feels to do that. That doesn’t mean that you don’t have your physical life to take care of. Each of us has the challenge of how to survive here, how to take care of ourselves, how to take care of the people we care about - find our own individual, unique way of making a difference. But you’re never alone. And on that note, let me un-mute everybody. Well, before I un-mute everybody, Carla, anything you’d like to add to all of this?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: My heart is just so full. I want to thank everybody for loving me and I want to tell everybody that I love them. I don’t know who you are, I haven’t met you but I hear your voices, I hear your suffering and you hear mine. It’s so wonderful to be a part of you and I so much appreciate that you’re a part of me. I honor you, I love you. I just open my heart and thank everybody, we are one heart and it’s beating with one message and that’s love and all we need to do is share it back and forth and all the miracles will happen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Thank you. You know we need each other. Not in a codependent way but in a co-creative way. The way we come together on these calls and hold this space is a way that we learn to lift each other, to co-create and learn about the higher aspects of ourselves in a way that creates a direct experience. So I thank you all for being here and teaching us how to do this. On that note I’m going to un-mute everybody and we’ll see you next time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Everybody</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Thank you all so much. Thank you Terry, thank you Wynn, thank you Carla, thank you Daphne, thank you Gijs … thank you, take care, love you all; have a great day. Have a wonderful week. Aloha. Love Light to everyone.</span></p>
