<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">The group energy creates protection.&nbsp; It’s not about bringing through some awesome message and giving up your power.&nbsp; Within a group energy, you’re empowered and we’re empowered.&nbsp; They can come in just as one of the guys; they’re not one of the guys, obviously.&nbsp; They’re not coming in as God or something bigger than life and, they are bigger than life.&nbsp; It’s kind of hard to explain.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">The topic for tonight is dreams.&nbsp; I have to say that I’m not an expert on dreams; I think both Daphne and Terry get more dreams than I do, and look at them.&nbsp; If you read <i>The Creator God book</i>, you’ll know that I told his amazing story that happened.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">The most amazing thing that happened to me was when Daphne first started channeling in 2002, and I was getting all these messages.&nbsp; I’m trying to figure this out; I’m trying to see “Can I trust this?&nbsp; Who is this talking to me?&nbsp; How do I know they are who they say?”&nbsp; At that time, we were having a very difficult life.&nbsp; I can tell you, for example:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Daphne and I at one point were driving two cars.&nbsp; I don’t know if I should talk about this because I don’t want to trigger her into it; she’s doing really well.&nbsp; Let’s just say, it was almost like she could hardly stay in her body; she was slipping out of her body.&nbsp; We have to buy a special walkie talkie to drive somewhere so that I could communicate with her to keep her centered.&nbsp; That was really strange; it was like I’d never understood this idea of negative greetings or negative attacks from other dimensions, and we were having them.&nbsp; At that time, I just asked in a question “I know I exist in other dimensions.&nbsp; How do I connect with the parts of myself that exist in other dimensions?”&nbsp; I had no idea what they would say.&nbsp; The answer was “To write your dreams down, and you’ll connect with the parts of yourself that exist in other dimensions.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">That night I put a pad by my bed and I would wake up I’d write something on the pad; go to sleep I’d write something on the pad.&nbsp; In the morning – I didn’t look at what I wrote I just wrote it.&nbsp; In the morning when I looked at the pad I was expecting to see stories of dreams.&nbsp; Instead, I found messages like somebody was talking to me.&nbsp; I remember those first messages; it was “It’s the insanity of passion that makes things happen in the real world.”&nbsp; “Through your dedication to love, serve and care, the negativity disappears.”&nbsp; “You’re supposed to be the front man.”&nbsp; “You have to look tall and thin.”&nbsp; “Communication from another dimension – just like Cayce – he slept to connect with this dimension.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">I remember looking at that in that morning and I said “I must be making this up; this is totally crazy.”&nbsp; I’m writing the book on David Wilcock, <i>The Reincarnations of Edgar Cayce</i>; I’ve got Daphne having this voice telling me they’re the Elohim, and suddenly I’m getting messages in my sleep.&nbsp; We went back and did a channeling on that. I said “Can you tell me who is talking to me in my dreams?”&nbsp; I was expecting them to say I was making it, because I was expecting dreams.&nbsp; They said, basically, it was the Ra group; there’s more to it than that.&nbsp; The whole story is in the Egyptian Connection if you listen to that workshop; but, they said it was the Ra group.&nbsp; It sounded like the Ra group.&nbsp; Keep in mind; I was like a baby.&nbsp; I was like going to school here.&nbsp; I was in a whole experience that never in my life could I even imagine was possible.&nbsp; I know that some of you who are paying attention to this work – I don’t blame you – say “There must be a mistake.&nbsp; It couldn’t be what he says it is.”&nbsp; I felt that way for three years so I understand it “How can this be?”, and “Why me?” and, “Why are they talking to me, and why is all this activity around me?”&nbsp; Of course, over the next few years it started to unfold piece by piece by piece.&nbsp; I’m not going to talk about that on this call; I just wanted to talk about how I got those dream messages.&nbsp; I want to share with you, specifically, how it felt.&nbsp; I believe if you’re connecting with the energies on this line and you feel the energy that there’s a really good chance you could get your own messages.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">There are two things that happen when you’re sleeping – one is you get dreams and one is you get messages.&nbsp; My take is that dreams have a lot of different meanings to them; it’s not easy to say “A dream is this; it means this.”&nbsp; I know they said this in one of the channeling about Terry.&nbsp; They said they were giving her dreams to help release some kind of karmic pattern.&nbsp; In other words, if you have a karmic pattern in the world and it keeps repeating and repeating, it seems like they have the ability to put your through a dream experience so you don’t have to have that experience in your life.&nbsp; For example, let’s suppose people are always killing you; maybe you’ll get killed in your dream and then that releases you from the karma of having that have to happen in your life.&nbsp; I don’t know if that’s the best example, but maybe.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Another thing about dreams is I assume the negative can project dreams and try to hypnotize you into something– we’re going to ask a question about that.&nbsp; Another aspect of dreams – I have not had this particular experience; or, if I have I don’t remember it – I think that people can meet on the astral in their dream state.&nbsp; I’ve heard of people telling me this – they’ve talked about it – they thought it was a dream that the other person was there.&nbsp; The other person had the same dream and the two people were in the same circumstance in their dreams.&nbsp; That seems to be a possibility. </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">We know that certain people sleep during our Sunday call, and my take is – I think we asked this question – when all this energy comes in and it’s more than your circuits are used to handling, you may fall asleep to just to process the energy on the unconscious level.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">When you start getting into the practice of that, and start to ask your high self to help you to remember; to help you to bring into focus what your higher self is trying to download into your consciousness, your angelics and your celestial guides will start to help you do this.&nbsp; I saw over a period of weeks and then months, I was given the language to start to decode the dreams.&nbsp; They actually kind of – they gave me a tutorial – in the symbolics of dreams and I started to see things in a very interesting way.&nbsp; It’s formed the whole way I look at everything – at numbers and color and form and picture – but, it’s something that’s very personal.&nbsp; It’s a relationship that happens over a period of time, but something I really really encourage people to delve into.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">When I woke up I looked around and I thought “Boy!

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Then there’s a teaching kind of a dream, like where I feel really bad when I make a mistake.&nbsp; If somebody calls me on my mistakes, then I just get really upset.&nbsp; In my dreams that they were sending me – I think it was the Ra group that was sending me – like I’d have these situations where I’d make a mistake.&nbsp; Then everybody would say “That’s okay; don’t worry about it.”&nbsp; I’d get a chance to do the thing again and make it come out better so that I thought “Alright! – I made this huge mistake but it’s really okay.&nbsp; I’m still a good person.”</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">So that’s a teaching kind of a dream; when after the dream I remember it and I feel better about myself. &nbsp;Then, when I make a mistake in my life, I think “Oh – well, it’s not the end of the world.”</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">I know for myself – when I talk about my own conscious self – it was very hard to write things down.&nbsp; It still is.&nbsp; I have to really discipline myself; sometimes I’ll hear them and I don’t write it down and I miss it.&nbsp; It feels like – do you know the experience for me; this is my experience in getting their verbal messages:&nbsp; It’s like I’m daydreaming.&nbsp; It’s like the experiences, there’s a little voice going in my mind, and it’s like me thinking.&nbsp; But, I’m not directing my thoughts, so I’m daydreaming but I’m sleeping; I’m in a twilight sleep.&nbsp; I am just in between sleep and wake, and I only get one sentence.&nbsp; I can’t get a whole bunch of stuff; I just get one sentence.&nbsp; Then, I go back to sleep and I wake up and I get another sentence.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Then I start watching it, and when I get good at it, it’s like the sentences are following each other.&nbsp; I would have thought that there was this dialogue going on and I’m missing most of it; but, I wasn’t.&nbsp; I’d get a sentence then twenty minutes later I’d get the next sentence – wherever these sentences were coming from, someone out there was paying attention to that moment when I was in twilight sleep.&nbsp; So, one sentence would lead to the next to the next.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">There’s a project that was started, I think in the late 90’s – I think it might have been at MIT – and it was called the Webbot project.&nbsp; They were basically computer scientists and A.I.s – artificial intelligence people – were looking at various spikes in Google search words and search engines; certain key words that were showing up at a much greater frequency than normal, and just the traffic on the internet.&nbsp; They were picking up a good three months, back in June of 2001, some disastrous event happening around September of 2001.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">You speak and communicate in architecture of language, and the language is a symbolic coding, a symbolic synopsis or encapsulation of frequencies which is encrypted and in the encryption enable certain packets or fragments of love light consciousness and intelligence to cohesively avail itself and to put together a stream of consciousness and to weave that fabric of consciousness into higher densification and stratifications of love light collective consciousness, thereby braiding and making available higher dimensions, higher densities, higher orchestrations, higher calibrations of the love light architecture.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">What you are learning to do with the dream work is to break down those symbols, those encrypted packaged codings of the love light language into the language thought-form and structure of thought-form.&nbsp; Your picture, your codes of pictures, actually contain more information than do singular words, thereby symbols and their like associations with many words, are a jumping off place for a multitude of meanings to be netted together or brought together as one would hold a strand of balloons, for example, in the hand.&nbsp; One can hold twenty or thirty balloons with the tethers of the string in one hand.&nbsp; Thus, the picture is very much like the hand holding the string and each of the balloons is perhaps a word or a key word having to do with the picture.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Learn to think in pictures; learn to think in terms of object, and then associations with the object.&nbsp; For example, if you are looking at a brick you can think of many things about a brick; you can think about weight, you can think about density, you can think about shape, you can think about what it would be like to draw the brick, what it would be like hold the brick, what it would be like to heat the brick – the uses for the brick.&nbsp; It could be used in a building, it could be used as part of a garden scene; it could be used a pathway along which one walks – yellow brick road:&nbsp; immediately symbolically can go out in many many different areas.&nbsp; Learn to stretch your imagination and the ways in which you see your world.&nbsp; A picture is worth a thousand words; and this is not simply a euphemism, this is in fact true.&nbsp; The more you can see and correlate what is seen with verbal expression and to color and to word and to texture and to taste and to music, the more that you open your mind to the various panorama that is associated with your physicality the more that you can expand your creative architecting.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">As such, you can start to uncode and you can start to learn the liquid life language which is in fact the orchestration of your higher Christed self.&nbsp; That being said, you are learning to unravel your own frequency coding blanket or enmeshment by which your higher self is actually instructing you, your lower self or your cognizing self in 3D.&nbsp; You are you own teacher, you are your own over soul, you are own over soul – what is the word we seek – advocate – you are the one who is guiding and tutoring your own self through this quagmire, through this enmeshment of what seems, at one level, confusion.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">When you ask for help, when you diligently – night after night before you retire for bed – make a mental assertion, make a request to your oversoul self, to your heavenly guide self, that you wish to partake in learning the language of the architectural spheres, so to speak.&nbsp; You shall be guided.&nbsp; You must ask with persistence; you must ask with intent, you must ask with focus.&nbsp; As you do this, it shall eventually come to you.&nbsp; As you move into a place of wanting to master this art, as it is indeed an art, you put forth the intention by perhaps writing down the dreams, by asking your over soul self to help you with the dreams, by asking your over soul self to help you remember the dreams and to decode the dreams and to make the dreams understandable and applicable in terms of understanding the different fragments and segments of your life and what is going on, you start to pull into your sphere of understanding the multidisciplinary and multifrequency aspects of braiding together a unified field of consciousness fabric. </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">The reason Daphne and Terry sound different is because – when I say because, this is me trying to figure this out – you have a group matrix; a huge matrix.&nbsp; Then, it combines with either of their matrices.&nbsp; They bring through words; it’s coming through, it’s forming, around their individuation.&nbsp; So, it’s different according to each of their individuations.&nbsp; Each has access to different kinds of information.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Let me turn it over to our sources as they speak through Terry and get a perspective on dream work.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Paying attention to your dreams and writing down in a notebook in the morning as you first wake up can begin to bring into your consciousness other levels of connection which you had; other beginnings, other realizations that can help you harmonize and can help you move through your patterns and move through your life in an expanded way.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">I have a question.&nbsp; The question is:&nbsp; Obviously I had an experience of getting those dream messages as I described earlier.&nbsp; I suspect that they were targeting me and trying to lay ground work for the kind of work I’m doing right now.&nbsp; How many people, if they asked, could get those kinds of messages?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">There was a thing in <i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce </i>was that as you move into service – I should read it; I don’t have it in front of me – those people who are predispostioned to do service have more resources sent to their direction.&nbsp; Let me repeat that again – that was from the Ra group through the David Wilcock: </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">1:15:30</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;"></span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">“As you are more committed to actually do service, you have more resources sent to you from the high realms.”</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Maybe my dream messages were part of those resources.&nbsp; I tell you people I was not in any way prepared to do this.&nbsp; I’m still not prepared to do it; I do it because I pushed myself through it.&nbsp; I said “I think this is going to be important to people.”&nbsp; I had to learn that it actually was important – not to just think it was.&nbsp; I didn’t feel worthy of doing it; I didn’t feel I could do it.&nbsp; I couldn’t feel that the world would respond.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">One thing I realize is that if you have a vision of something you can do, you don’t have to depend on being ready.&nbsp; I used to feel that; I used to think I had to be ready to do something – everything has to be right.&nbsp; I can’t feel any unworthiness; I have to feel self love I have to feel perfect.&nbsp; That’s not been my experience; my experience is: if you actually see the vision and move towards it the other stuff comes in secondarily, not before.&nbsp; The doing creates the other stuff.&nbsp; If you wait for the other stuff to come in, it never happens.&nbsp; That’s my experience.&nbsp; That’s one of the tricks that keeps us in an inert space; because we wait for it to feel right and we think there’s going to be this magic that happens and say ”Elohim and Ra; fix my unworthiness.&nbsp; Do this; do that.”&nbsp; That’s not my experience; they didn’t fix mine.&nbsp; Doing this work fixes me.&nbsp; It’s fixed Terry; I’ve watched it fix Daphne.&nbsp; It’s like no one was ready and yet doing it, it’s the doingness that brings in the resources from higher dimensions that starts to fix you; that’s my experience.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">The question is:&nbsp; Obviously everyone would like to have the Ra group talking to them in their sleep and giving them wisdom and guidance.&nbsp; What does a person have to do to be worthy and to have that kind of experience?&nbsp; Maybe they don’t have to do anything and maybe worthiness is not the right word.&nbsp; They want their dream-teacher; they want guidance; they want verbal messages.&nbsp; What happened to me – how easy would that be for someone else to bring that in for themselves?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Usually when a person wakes up first thing in the morning they can have a glimmer of something that happened when they were sleeping but it’s like being in a different realm; then, when they wake up, then their whole surroundings in their room is there and their whole focus shifts off of the dream scenario in the other realm and quickly evaporates; quickly disperses.&nbsp; So before they’ve totally woken up they grab their dream journal and put something down and tack it down.&nbsp; Then, they can begin to remember – sometimes only a little bit and – sometimes remembering the little bit can bring more into their focus.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">The other day when Terry was sleeping and woke up, between sleeping and waking she remembered being out of her body and standing by the car.&nbsp; Then, when she woke up, there was the room and she rapidly dissipated that memory of standing by the car.&nbsp; It’s like being in two different places or two different worlds.&nbsp; If you can get it tacked down, even one little picture, and as you work on it day by day you can remember more and more and get into that other realm and see what was happening there.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">The other thing was where two people have the same dream together and they end up comparing notes.&nbsp; It was like they both moved into an astral space and they actually were together in their dream state.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Can our sources make any comment on these two experiences?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">We would see that some of the dreamscape would be experienced in this way and some of it could be apparently instructed or guided or worked out as you would say in the other realms – yes.&nbsp; The overarching answer to your question is yes; we see it as a kind of a teaching forum or a teaching dissemination whereby awareness – awareness is key – once things are brought into the consciousness, the major lesson has been learned.&nbsp; Then, as the consciousness chooses, one can find various channels be they 3D channels – 4d, 5d, 6d, ad infinitum – channels in which to work out the various manifestations of the energetic rippling effect.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">Once the consciousness has unlocked or unleashed a karmic knot as it were, it can be more easily, more readily, subdued or assimilated or processed.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white; font-size: medium;">They’re saying that the dream is actually a teaching device that they use; that the key to releasing the karmic pattern is actually understanding – from what I’m understanding of their message.</span></p>
