<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is an unusual call; as many of you who come in regularly know.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s unusual because I tell people, “Do not believe anything.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I can share my experience.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope if you’re coming into this call you’ve read the book that I wrote and you’ve looked at the videos on intelligent-infinity.net because you need to ramp up.<span>&nbsp; </span>You need to ramp yourself up to see if it fits; if there’s energy on it for you.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is not a call where you can show up and we’re going to say, “Here’s what happening.”<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, that’s not very important what’s happening.<span>&nbsp; </span>What is most important that we set an example here for how to connect with the vibrations of the higher dimensions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We have communicated for a long time now with a voice that says it’s the Elohim; they say they created this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’ve demonstrated to me many, many times phenomena [and] miracles; they’ve demonstrated it to people that come into this line.<span>&nbsp; </span>They don’t want you to give up your power to them.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are not God in any religious way of looking at the Word of God.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, they are at the beginning of the universe; they are at the top of all the dimensions.<span>&nbsp; </span>They have the ability to flow into this dimension energetically.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can do it in a way that you can feel them.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, when they do that, you’ll know it’s occurred.<span>&nbsp; </span>On these calls, we have learned how to bring their energy into the call.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I say ‘bring their energy into this call’, what does that mean?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does it feel?<span>&nbsp; </span>It's one of the most important reasons to come to these<b> </b>calls: to learn to tune into that energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I heard this before I was doing it, and I said if some intelligence that created the universe is something that you’re going to feel on a phone call – I would have said, “Sure.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, I would have thought, if it was possible, it was going to be like burning bushes [and] bright lights – all kinds of really intense things.<span>&nbsp; </span>It can be intense but in general it’s a subtle, smooth flow that actually feels like you suddenly became expanded.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Elohim are part of you.<span>&nbsp; </span>The universe is one energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you feel something that’s part of yourself, that's way bigger than you, then it’s a subtle feeling; it just feels expanded.<span>&nbsp; </span>It feels like you in a more expanded space.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">That’s how they come into this realm; it’s like a frequency.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s kind of like – have you ever had a good friend or a family [member] when you were around them – something shifted inside of you?<span>&nbsp; </span>It wasn’t because you were talking; it wasn’t because you were engaging; it wasn’t because of anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was something that happened on a more subtle level and you just felt relaxed; you felt comfortable; you felt at home.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re in their space – I’m actually in somebody’s home right now – it’s like I can feel their energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>I went up to the bedroom and I can feel their energy surrounding me as I’m in the place.<span>&nbsp; </span>It feels different than Sedona.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everywhere we go – we don’t pay attention all the time – but we’re moving in and out of different energies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">These sources we communicate with are also energies, just like people in the physical realm are energies, but their energies are not in this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>They don’t originate from this realm, but they can project into this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you learn to tap into it, it’s just like they’re here!<span>&nbsp; </span>You start to get comfortable with it.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s the value – one of the values – of these calls: learning to get comfortable with that energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>We start out by getting comfortable with each other, because the more comfortable we are with each other, the easier it is to open up to the energies of the higher realms.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just learned this by hook-and-crook; they didn’t explain this to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was a matter of uncovering it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When we do all that tom-foolery at the beginning of the call, it’s part of getting our energies comfortable with each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of you kn<b>o</b>w this:<span>&nbsp; </span>I used to be a singer-songwriter.<span>&nbsp; </span>I used to go around and perform in front of audiences.<span>&nbsp; </span>I got used to the idea of how to make an audience relax, and I think that’s one of the reasons – maybe – why they started talking to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, if you don’t do it that way, it becomes a holier-than-thou thing; not that that’s wrong, but it’s not as accessible.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is holy; it is sacred.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, it’s accessible.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems like my particular ‘niche’ in this is to create a very comfortable space so they can come in and there’s already a comfort zone when they start talking.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of you can feel them; they’re in between my words; they’re in-between the spaces – and, they’re watching us.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can open yourself up to the possibility that they’re watching you.<span>&nbsp; </span>You don’t have to have any shame, you don’t have to have any guilt because they’re not judgmental.<span>&nbsp; </span>They won’t intrude on your space unless you ask them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One of the reasons they got such a tough rap throughout history – i.e. the tough rap as being God – is [because] part of their criteria was honoring free will.<span>&nbsp; </span>Somebody had to ask for their assistance down here.<span>&nbsp; </span>That idea of asking became known as prayer.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re sick, if there’s something wrong with you and you ask and something gets better, then it seems pretty awesome.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, it seems like they have all the power and we don’t.<span>&nbsp; </span>But – what I’ve learned – it’s always co-creative.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s always – asking is more than just saying, “I want you guys to do this, do this, do that, do that”, give them a laundry list of everything.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s a connection to be made, and it’s learning how to tune into their frequency.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you send letters to the wrong address, they never get there.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s learning how to address the envelopes properly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Being on these calls is a great assistance.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have a couple of people who have asked questions, they’ve had experiences.<span>&nbsp; </span>They told </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gary</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> – </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gary</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> asked them about his eye and they said they were working with it and they had a team of people helping him with his eye.<span>&nbsp; </span>Contrary to what the doctors were saying, his eye started getting better.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mary is on the line; she was on the line and asked for their help.<span>&nbsp; </span>She sent me an email right after –said they were working with her and she saw something scan across her eyes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her eyes are showing improvement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We’ve had many, many instances like that on this line.<span>&nbsp; </span>The only reason I’m a believer is because I keep watching these instances.<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn’t know that would happen when we started.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, the idea of going into healing was a little bit uncomfortable for me.<span>&nbsp; </span>It all originated when my sister had that healing, and I said, “How do you set this up so other people can take advantage of it?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We have some really interesting questions tonight.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the questions is about something called ‘ascension’, which a lot of people are talking about.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m going to set a little bit of information up about that before I ask the question.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t think it will be the first question.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Starting with the Bible, starting with Jesus – there’s this idea of the rapture and that we’d all be disappearing from this realm and going somewhere else but, it was people who were worthy or that made the grade, so to speak.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, there was a lot of information in David Wilcock and then I was asking questions about that.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was a whole new understanding of what that meant esoterically in the fact that the way it was being described by these sources is that we’re at the end of a cycle and the energy of the earth and whole solar system is being ‘ramped up’ higher than it’s ever been before in the history of mankind.<span>&nbsp; </span>This ramped-up energy is causing a lot of changes, and we’re in the middle of all those changes right now – watching them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Aside from physical changes: tsunamis, earthquakes, and weather changes – all the planets in the solar system are changing.<span>&nbsp; </span>If this is new to you, you should be sure and get <i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce</i> because it explains it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">[Among] all these changes, there’s another change that’s<span>&nbsp; </span>happening and it has to do with the earth, which is a conscious being.<span>&nbsp; </span>[The earth] is moving from what’s called 3D to 4D, or from third chakra to fourth chakra.<span>&nbsp; </span>The third chakra is your solar plexus; it has to do with power and individuality.<span>&nbsp; </span>The fourth chakra is your heart – it has to do with compassion and empathy.<span>&nbsp; </span>The earth is moving into compassion and empathy.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, the energy of the earth is changing.<span>&nbsp; </span>That means, in order for a human to continue with this upgraded earth – you could call it the new earth – their own heart chakra has to be open slightly more than half or else they won’t fit.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their energy field doesn’t fit into the earth anymore.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s like getting a square peg in a round hole.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The way the universe deals with that is that those souls that don’t fit into this upgraded earth continue their evolution on another planet, in another star system dedicated to third chakra evolution.<span>&nbsp; </span>The earth is now in fourth chakra evolution.<span>&nbsp; </span>So – they are cycle-repeaters.<span>&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the people with open hearts won’t be there, so it sounds like it’s going to be a tough place for quite some time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">How do their souls get moved from one plane to another?<span>&nbsp; </span>This stuff I’m telling you, “Don’t believe me.”<span>&nbsp; </span>You have to read my materials, because you can’t believe it because I say it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don’t believe it because I say it, it’s too far out.<span>&nbsp; </span>You have to see consistency of the way information folds together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We’re talking about the Elohim group who created this universe.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s another group soul player, which is the Ra group, which is made up of souls that graduated the physical realm; who came into this realm, have gone through thousands of bodies, thousands of reincarnation episodes and graduated.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eventually they became pure energy; individuated pure energies helping planets at the lower levels go through their – you could call it – ‘graduation’.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you make the grade to graduate the earth from third dimension to fourth dimension or from power to heart – that’s called a graduation.<span>&nbsp; </span>You no longer have to go back and do the power stuff, you’ve gone above it and you now can begin operating in learning about oneness, learning about love, learning about connection.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">How do these souls get to this planet who are cycle repeaters?<span>&nbsp; </span>In one bit of material from Carla Rueckert, the way they move from one planet to another is because they’re carried by the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Ra group is these pure energies that no longer have bodies; don’t ask me to explain it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can’t explain it, but they move souls from one place to another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are other indications that Jesus was a product of the Ra group, or a co-creation of the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’ll notice the whole description I’m giving is very similar to the Bible, but in a more esoteric way.<span>&nbsp; </span>The way the Bible says it:<span>&nbsp; </span>“One will be taken, one will be left behind,”<span>&nbsp; </span>“The meek will inherit the earth,” “There’s going to be a separation of souls.”<span>&nbsp; </span>If we have it correctly, that is what’s happening now right on our planet.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are all involved in consciously deciding which way we’re going to go by our ability to keep our hearts open.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When we have that – I call it kibitzing or fun – at the beginning of the calls, that is part of keeping your heart open; that is creating a vibe amongst each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>Learning how to do that is teaching us all to do it; we’re doing it.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re not talking about it; we’re doing it.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have this phenomenal guidance because we have both group souls paying attention to our group – so they say.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is what I tell people if you’re new, “Don’t believe anything; kick the tires.<span>&nbsp; </span>Read the materials.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">A lot of people say that this could be negative, or maybe this is the devil.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tell people, “Maybe it is.<span>&nbsp; </span>You figure it out.<span>&nbsp; </span>Go look at it and read it and study it; and if it doesn’t feel right I’m not going to tell you to believe it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Go somewhere else.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m doing this whole talk about this particular topic because there is a question of:<span>&nbsp; </span>How do you graduate this realm, and what is ascension?<span>&nbsp; </span>What is the rapture?<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve asked a lot of questions about that.<span>&nbsp; </span>At one point fairly recently, they said most people are not going to qualify – I’m going to answer as we’ve heard it so then they can catch up and don’t have to repeat themselves.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Most souls aren’t going to qualify to graduate this realm in their body.<span>&nbsp; </span>That would mean, on some level, [that] your body disappears [and] ends up somewhere else.<span>&nbsp; </span>They said in order to graduate this realm with your body, all your chakras have to be open.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most people are not going to have that occur.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, they were talking about what they called ‘astral ascension’ which meant you would die a natural death and if your heart was open slightly more than half – if your heart was open – then they would work with you on the other side and you would graduate.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, it wouldn’t be through ascension, or it wouldn’t be a physical ascension.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most people are not going to qualify for physical ascension.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t emphasis it, but Rahmi asked the question tonight.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, I’m giving you all the background so when they answer the question you have the history of it and no one is left not understanding.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">They don’t want you to – I was going to say ‘kiss their ass’, but they don’t have asses and it’s not a respectful terminology.<span>&nbsp; </span>They don’t you to be differential to them.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I ask them, “Do you really like it if people worship you?” they said, “No.<span>&nbsp; </span>Worship creates a separation; worship creates a division.”<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, they are us; we are them.<span>&nbsp; </span>I said that earlier.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are a lot of keys in all this material and if you don’t read it; if you don’t come into these calls, what can I tell you?<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re putting it out for free.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think it’s that important that anybody that reaches for it shouldn’t miss it.<span>&nbsp; </span>So it’s on you to reach back.<br /> <br /> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One way of reaching back is to come to the calls; another way of reaching back is to send money and support the work we’re doing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Another way of reaching back is join TeamShift and make a little community.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m doing my best to put stuff out that people can use. “Why do I do this?<span>&nbsp; </span>Why do I do three calls a week and not charge for it and all this stuff for free?”<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s because they were saying there’s going to be this division of souls.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">By the way, a lot of people say the whole planet is ascending – the whole planet may be ascending, but that doesn’t mean all the people on the planet are ascending.<span>&nbsp; </span>A lot of new age people don’t take this into consideration:<span>&nbsp; </span>somewhere between 5 and 30% are going to actually graduate this realm – 5 to 30%.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don’t be so quick to think you don’t have to work hard to make sure you get over the grade.<span>&nbsp; </span>Usually the first thing, when somebody hears that, is fear comes up.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, cope with your fear and keep moving through it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Based on research and what has been shared, the following seems to be accurate in terms of information transmitted by various extensions of the all-oneness over several time periods.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is a experiencing a dimensional shift which may bring about drastic material transformations, as it transitions into fourth density.<span>&nbsp; </span>Humans who are deemed ready for harvest will also shift into fourth density.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Earth is going through a transition at this time, and it is experiencing high vibration, as high vibration is coming in, and today is Venus transit across the sun, which increases even further these frequencies in the high intensity, which does place more stress on parts of the earth.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, parts of the earth respond, and move into a greater harmony.<span>&nbsp; </span>It jostles them to move into the great earth’s harmony with the different particles that are co-existing in the earth’s realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, these particles, these forces, that are interacting with earth at this time are indeed moving the earth into a higher vibration and the earth is following. Some areas of earth are reacting with earthquakes and the settling and the forming of new connections, which then leads into earth changes a locality or in a broader area.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">And men, as they exist on the planet today in the body and the body being of “matter” the body then also responds to the forces that are brought to bear and comes along for the ride.<span>&nbsp; </span>The individuals, as they pass over into the astral, have predetermined where they are going by their own vibrations and their own intentions and their own desires and their own free will, as free will is not violated.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are the captives of where they will be aligned with and where they then will be transported to, or will end up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Some of the transport mechanism is merely synchronicity of vibration, so that the vibrations being the same in nature, then coalesce the individuals within into that particular area.<span>&nbsp; </span>The individuals then, as is the best for them – the highest good for them at the time for their own growth and for their self-expression – are moving into that area where they will receive and be able to express the biggest growth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It should be guarded against to assume that all individuals should go to one location, to the highest, and should manifest the greatest amount of love and peace because – the individuals are, at all points, on their growth curve.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can then, in this certain circumstances, the way things happen and work out, they can address through their own intentions and will, their own future, and where they will end up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There is another choice, which although it is possible to look at an area of disconnection and say that an individual may end up with dissolution and that this would be a horrible fate.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is a way of some individuals, they merge back into the light, and in merging back into the light they achieve complete fulfillment, complete bliss, complete light.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is outside of space/time and is a magnificent homecoming.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Other individuals, who have totally become disconnected, may then feel alone, and – through their desire to disconnect – end up in an area of disconnection.<span>&nbsp; </span>That is also part of their growth process, to then feel what it is like to be totally isolated and totally disconnected, although they may feel that this will bring them peace; then, eventually they realize that it is only through connection that they can achieve peace.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So, individuals, as they live their daily life from lining up, so to speak, experiences and vibrations that bring them to a connection with an area that is similar to where they are – that they can then continue to work through whatever they are working through.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I think that’s one of the things that I realized, and I just wanted to reiterate it: how important connection was; how important – not only is connection important for you – it’s important for other people.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re allowing yourself to be isolated, you’re doing yourself and those other people who you care about a great disservice.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, you can’t connect with people who don’t want to be connected with, because that’s free will.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are so many people who are hungry and reaching right now, and to find a way to touch those people.<span>&nbsp; </span>As I get it – I’ll just stop and let them comment – if you touch someone like that, in a true authentic way, just that act in and of itself can change the path of a person instantly, by holding that connection.<span>&nbsp; </span>We don’t have to go through, “I have to get my heart open” – it keeps your heart open and keeps someone else’s heart open.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Am I accurate?<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m asking our sources:<span>&nbsp; </span>Am I accurate in the way that I expressed that?</span></p>
