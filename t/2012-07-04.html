We have been doing this for a couple of years now and probably with about 30 or 40 people on the line. I have to give them great thanks for holding the energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Suddenly, our procedures are going to have to be upgraded to learn how to accommodate all the new people who are coming on, all the people who are needing help. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Obviously this is very unusual, what we’re doing. It’s a learn-as-you-go process; the idea is; how do we create the highest service? How do we impact the most people? How do we support ourselves while we’re doing that? What are the procedures that we use to make it all work? Obviously, telling the story about my sister and having somebody have a miraculous healing, encourages people to think “I want that, too.” I don’t blame you for wanting it too. What’s the process that people can access this energy so they have that option?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">In terms of watching people on our calls, we have had some amazing things. We have other people where there’s no shift. What I see is that there are a number of things that cause a healing to be possible. First of all, we’re doing something out-of-the-box here; we are saying that we’re communicating with a voice that identifies itself as The Creator of the Universe. One of the things about that is that I don’t tell people that’s who they are; I say that’s who they say they are. Over the period of time that I have been having these communications, I’ve come to the point of view that I think they are who they say they are. There are many things that have occurred in this work, some of the things which I’m going to talk about on this Saturday workshop, that are pretty compelling and convincing. For the people that are listening on our calls, there are many things that have happened on these calls.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">One of the things is they’re not here to prove themselves by creating miracles. As I have felt their agenda, if they have an agenda, it’s:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They want to speed up the spiritual evolution on our planet. They want to help you speed up your spiritual evolution. This is a unique process; you could say that it’s non-linear so to speak, because you can’t understand it in your mind. There is an energy on our calls; there is an energy on these lines. When I say they’re on the lines, they’re obviously not on the phone lines; they’re in your bedroom, they’re in your living room; there’s a shift. You who are sensitive to that are learning how to connect and identify an energy that’s projected from outside of this realm, into this realm. When we connect with that, then what happens is there’s a melding of holograms.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It would be like when you’re with somebody, a friend, and you feel your friend’s energy; they’re in a body; they’re projecting through the physical world and you can feel them and they can feel you. We are working with the idea that there’s an energy that’s not in this realm. We can’t see it; we don’t know it’s there. We have no visible representation; yet, on this line, many people feel it. We’ve asked hundreds and hundreds of questions to both Terry and Daphne, mostly Terry on this particular Wednesday night call. Daphne’s coming in and starting to participate as well. We’ve asked many questions that I think when the question was asked, the people on this line were thinking, “How are they going to answer that?” It’s just amazing, because they answer the questions that a human couldn’t answer; there’s no reference point.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">You can go look at our archive section. We have lots of our conference calls up there; it’s pretty sloppy. It needs to be edited. You’ll hear people saying “Hi, this is, somebody.” We had a small group and everybody would say something at the beginning of the call. The small group that has been on these calls has become kind of a family. I want you to know, you guys who have been holding for this; I’ve not disappeared. It’s different now. You’re part of what we are creating and we’re going to figure it all out as we go.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I thought I would just have a couple of people who had some kind of personal experience share their experience as a result of being on this line. Let me say again, if you’re coming for, expecting, a healing, it may happen. But it may not happen right now. The reason is, we have come to this point, right now. I won’t say everyone, but most of us have come to this point carrying a huge track of garbage and many lifetimes of being compressed in this realm and creating patterns. I want you to know; that’s not your fault. You didn’t do anything wrong; it’s just what happens in this realm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">This is an opportunity to release that baggage. This is not like a New Age technique; this is not like, “You do this and you do that and you say a mantra.” This is making a connection with the part of you that existed before the baggage, because that part still exists now. These Sources that we’re dealing with, my way of understanding it is, when we start to create an energetic connection with them, it creates an opportunity for you to move above your baggage, above the place where all this got created.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It can start to dissipate; it can start to fall away. For every person it’s going to be different. Since we’ve never had so many new people on the line at one time, we’re going to ask them “What is your best approach to this work?” so rather than it comes from me, it will come from them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">In terms of releasing your baggage, first of all I’ll tell you a couple of things that I’ve noticed: there has to be an intensity of purpose on your part. This is not saying “Do this for me, do that for me, do this for me, help me.” You have to have an intensity of purpose, a conviction and endurance. You can look at our work and you can say “This is really happening. He’s really doing this. But, I’m not feeling it yet.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Some people do feel it; some people have something happen right away. Some people don’t, because they’re still feeling their own baggage, their traumas, the things they’ve done wrong. I shouldn’t even use the world ‘wrong’, it’s not the right word, the things we have done to disable our own connection with our own spiritual self. If you’ve done things like that, this is not to hold yourself to blame. You didn’t know any better. You didn’t know what you were doing. You didn’t know the repercussions. You didn’t even know you had a spiritual form. You were struggling to get along in this world; life in this world can be tough. Making ends meet can be tough. If you met the wrong person and the wrong person led you down a path and screwed you up for ten lifetimes; that can happen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">This is a new moment right now and all of that is in the past, except, you’re carrying it as your luggage. The first step is to look at our work carefully enough to say “I think he might really be doing this” and pay attention for a while and consider the possibility that your luggage can release. There’s a Christian term for that when that occurs. The Christian term is called Grace. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Grace, from a metaphysical standpoint, is when you move your energy out of your own timelines into the timelines above where the stuff was created and something shifts. We need this for the planet right now. We need it desperately for the planet. Who is going to create it for the planet? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Not the Elohim; not the Ra group, it has to be you and me. Then, they will come in and support it. But if we’re not doing it, they don’t do it. What I’ve learned is that we are the ground crew. Many of you have wanted to be of service your entire life and you’re going to learn how to be of greater service than you ever imagined possible, on these calls.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I wanted to take a moment and I want to introduce two women (the two women I discussed in my book, <i>The Creator Gods</i>. I’m so blessed to have them both on the line and both coming forward. Daphne is on the road with her mother in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Virginia</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">, I believe. Terry is in the next bedroom in Sedona. Terry, would you like to just share anything with all these new people that are listening?</span></p>

We met when Terry was doing a multi-level marketing company; we met in the </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Bahamas</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">. Now this is what she tells me: She remembers before she came into this realm. She and I knew each other in other dimensions and that I jumped into this realm and I disappeared. We were friends, so she jumped in looking for me. That was umpteen millions of years ago. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Terry remembers things and I’ve known her for a long time. To tell you the truth, I said “I don’t know about this part of Terry; I think maybe she’s slightly a nut case.” I now know she’s not a nut case, but I was not open to this, even fifteen years ago. </span></p>

She kept telling me to come with her; I would never come.

If you’re not on track with our call for a while, or reading our materials, or picking this all up, there are two soul groups which I believe are positive. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It’s very important with channeling to be very discerning, because channeling in and of itself can bring in negative. There are a lot of negative sources in other realms which I have learned about. Some of you have negative attacks and some of you have experienced some of that. There are all kinds of ways that this realm has been manipulated by the negative.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Any time there is a channeling, even with Terry and Daphne, you’re not supposed to give up your power. You’re supposed to apply your own discernment and make sure it resonates. The only reason I’m doing these calls publicly like this is because it’s passed my own test. It requires an incredibly positive intent to keep the negative out. There can’t be self-aggrandizement; there can’t be ego.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">One of the reasons we do so many things for free, is because when you start charging money for everything, it’s very easy that you start, even for myself, the temptation. It looks like you start maximizing the money, instead of maximizing the service. When we do have the donation things, believe me it really helps us. We’re doing this workshop for only $10 on Saturday [</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">7/7/12</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">]. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Not only will it be an immense value to yourself in ramping up your speed in connecting with all of this, but it helps us, because everyone on this line, Daphne, myself and Terry, have made huge sacrifices to bring this to this point. I had been trying, bugging George Noory for years. For some reason, we slipped through the cracks and we got on. We went over well and I think he liked us. I hope he’ll put us on again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We’re tying to turn that experience into something that can be of service to you. It’s important that you support us back, because that actually helps make an energetic connection that helps you connect. Don’t do it until you feel it; but, if you feel it, do it.</span></p>

There are a lot of people who have had amazing experiences, but I’m not going to go through them all. I will ask Gijs. Are you there, Gijs?</span></p>

The 30 to 40 people have rotated somewhat, but they’ve all gotten to know each other. That’s not going to be possible with 300-400 people on the call. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We have things in place; we have something called Team Shift; I don’t think you should join that yet. We have some people who have signed up for it that we haven’t put in yet, because I want you to be on these calls for a couple of weeks, or three weeks, to get into the feel of it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Team Shift is a program that I put together. This has been going for a couple of years. Edna Eisenbach has been managing it. What it is is groups of three to five people who meet every day, and they have their own conference line. They do something which is our little<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> </b>ritual:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Calling in the Light. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Really, they’ve learned to feel the energy on this line and carry it into this small group so the energies can be the same on the Team Shift line. Then, they put thing in the Light every day. I know I got an email from someone in Team Shift who told me they were putting their son and I think there was somebody else, two people in the Light that had Hepatitis C and their Hepatitis C disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">The theory is that our group souls are paying attention to you, right now. They’re paying attention; they’re looking at you. They can do that because they’re a group energy. I’ll never understand exactly how this works, but they can move through the realms; they can jump into our realm as energy in a way that you can feel them. Some of you may be feeling them and some of you say “What’s he talking about?” This is where you have to keep coming into the calls; this is where you have to read our materials. This is where you have to break through your mind, which is going to say “This is impossible!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I had to do that. Personally, if somebody told me they were doing this, I would say, “How do you know you’re doing that?” You have to apply yourself; listen to all the stories; listen to the people; listen to what’s happened and make it worth while to show up. We do it three times a week. Team Shift is once a day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">You can gauge all that for yourself and follow your own heart. If it starts to work for you, it’s a great thing. We have the thing, particularly on our Sunday calls, of putting things in the Light, putting people in the Light, putting ourselves in the Light and asking for help with different problems.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Gijs has been coming into the calls for a couple of years at least. One time he showed up when I was late and he started greeting people. From that point on, almost every call we’ve done, he’s been greeting people at the beginning of the call. I think because he was doing that and he took it on to be of service, he increased his own affinity and connection with these Sources.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Why don’t you share what happened with your son, Gijs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

It was last year, the first of January was on a Saturday and my son told me and said “The number one wish I have is for my warts to disappear”, because it was going on for a year and a half, two years, or so. The next day on the call somebody else asked for his warts to be gone from his son and I thought “Hey, I can tag onto that.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I think it was important to tell that in the meantime before I did it I saw my son; he walked up to me and I said “Hey Eddie, can I ask on this call for your warts?” “Of course” he said, “Please do that.” I requested that on a Sunday. The very next day I was at work and my wife called me. She said “Wow, I can’t believe it; Eddie’s warts are disappearing.” It was the very next day. It took another like another two weeks or so and everything was gone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

When you came into the call; you said something. Do you remember what you asked for?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

I said I had a couple of Native American spirits in my house. I found out that they were in a lot of the neighborhood homes. The little girl next door had told my grandson that when there was no one else to play with, she would play with the spirits. I said “Okay.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We had things turning off and on in our home, so I figured “Well, they’re here.” On one of the calls I said “Can we work on my house? I think I’ve got a couple of spirits here.” Terry channeled; there were a couple of Native Americans here and in the neighborhood there were more. Some of them wanted to go in the Light and some of them didn’t. I remember; one of them gave us a name. Then, I did see a couple of them go into the Light and Terry, I believe, saw several of them go into the Light. A few of them held back.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">A few days later my grandson was over. He has the little neighbor girl over playing. I asked her “Ellie, do you still have your spirits that you play with?” She said “No, they’re gone. I miss them, but they left.” I said “Okay.” It was confirmation that hers left, too.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

This is a free will association, so the Sources never force anything. There are a lot of spirits that are stuck in the earth realm. When they connect with an energy, apparently those spirits can feel them. They can give them a choice to release them from being in their bondage to the earth; they’re kind of ghosts, so to speak. But, there is never any force.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">When we put things in the Light, there’s always the stipulation for the highest good of all concerned, number one and honoring free will. The negative does have free will; the Sources won’t stop something from the negative, except under one condition, that there are enough people reaching for their help. As they look at it, as I’ve come to understand it, there is a balance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">They can read the energy of our entire planet, of our entire collective. It’s either more slanted towards the positive or more slanted towards the negative. They have said that the more it’s slanted towards the positive, the more interventions they’re able to do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">What that means is we on this line, who are discovering this material, are learning how to hold a positive energy in this realm, learning how to get over your fear, learning how it feels and the joy of connecting with the higher realms. We are part of that influence. The more people that find us, the better it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We’re not the only ones; there are lots and lots of people, whether they call it prayer—they don’t have to know all the stories, they don’t have to know it’s the Elohim. I believe that when people are intently praying they can find their energy; it starts to change the nature of the collective.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Right now, there’s nothing more important than that. If the collective does not cling to the positive and hold that energy, then the negative can do all their plans and the Sources can’t or won’t; I don’t know how that works, but interventions don’t happen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">There have been interventions. In reading David Wilcock, he’s talking about people going into battlefields and guns not going off. I haven’t validated that for myself. We understand that nuclear weapons have been disabled at different times and people think its ETs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">This is like building a relationship. They’re not God in the way that we see and think of God; they’re a team of energies that can operate as one. They can combine; they have councils. They are monitoring our realm. Probably what’s unusual about what we are doing is that, if all our premises are correct, when they come in we’re having not only feeling their energy, we’re having verbal communications with them. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">They explain to us things directly, without any kind of religiousness or belief-ness. You don’t have to believe anything; just listen and say “Who was that giving that message right now?” You should be skeptical. You have to keep listening to feel the pattern of it. They say that as you listen to their words, as you read their words, you start to connect energetically with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I have a whole document here of things that people have brought in to talk about or to ask for. There’s no way I can get to everybody; part of these calls I’m going to have to turn to a period of silence, where you let them look at you and you establish the connection and let the healing occur, if that’s going to happen, without me verbally talking to them. There just won’t be enough time to do it, particularly as we get bigger and bigger. I’m looking at organizing this, helping to bring in other people who do healings, so the load of working with people can be divided.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">When you have some kind of disability, disease, there are a couple of things to consider. Number<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> </b>one is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In the physical realm, how well are you taking care of yourself? How good is your nutrition and what are the things in your body that are holding energy and blocking your energy that’s causing you to have that disability? Can that be cleared? When these things clear, it’s usually a group project, where you are part of the healing. That’s not done to you; they don’t want that kind of relationship where people are just asking them “Do me a favor here; do me a favor and heal me.” You become part of it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">In Gijs’ case, with his son’s warts and in my case with my sister, in both cases, the person that was getting the healing was not on the call. In my sister’s case, she had no idea I was talking to these guys. The way that I think that works is that when you have an energetic connection with another person and you come on these lines and you start getting an energetic connection with these Sources, the connection moves through you to the other person. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">You are actually part of the healing. What do I mean by an energetic connection?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It means you love them. It means that when you’re by yourself, you can think of them and a loving feeling comes over you. That means you have a pipeline, you and those people have a pipeline as I did with my sister and as Gijs did with his son.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">For example, maybe you have somebody you’re close to whose doing drugs and he’s really in a difficult situation; the energetic pipeline might be somewhat disabled. That doesn’t mean you still shouldn’t put him in the Light, because there are things that happen if they’re in close relationship to you that maybe that energy can connect, even though in the outer realms they’re mad at you or whatever, on the inner realms there might be a connection.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

If you want to feel the energies, the best call is our Sunday morning call, because that is totally focused on feeling the energies. If you come to that call regularly, there’s a good chance you’re going to feel it; some people have felt it right away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Right now, we invoke a group energy connection amongst all of us present on this line and we do this while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I want to explain one thing: that is, I have learned that when we are dealing with a group energy, they actually blend. I don’t know if ‘blend’ is the right word; they work through the person who is channeling them. This is not a total-trance channeling; the person still has their personality; they’re using the mental structures of that person; so they’re going to sound different between Daphne and Terry.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

The purpose of this exercise is not to cause you to disempower yourself to these Sources; it’s to cause you to empower yourself and to have friends in high places. You can energetically connect with them and they can become familiar to you, and you’re a friend. I believe that is the kind of relationship that they would strive for with each of us.</span></p>

This is an energy connection that is a bringing of the electrical potentials of the various parts of the hand into harmony, as pain occurs when there is a separation, a break, in the communication. This occurs within the body when there is a break in the communication between the nerve cells and of the various parts of the body and it occurs emotionally when there is a break, a disconnect between individuals.</span></p>

What your physicists will come to know and what your mystics, saints and sages have known from time immemorial is that the miracle particle is love. Love is the most powerful force in the Universe.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">You are literally, dear ones, celestial archangels in training; for that is what you are, moving into a timeline beyond linearity, going to infinity, where your spirit source will be allowed to express its perfection of sacred possibilities in the physical architecture of the earth’s realm. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">You are literally, at this time, preparing to launch into a critical light-speed, into critical escape velocity, from a prison of physicality into an expression of heavenly architecture within physicality. A possible creation, yes, of heaven, not on this earth as you experience it today, but an earth that you shall experience six months down the line.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It is indeed a glorious, glorious moment and we eagerly await this opportunity to help birth the silver light cord structures moving from this matrix into the golden sun Ra, literally the Sun s-o-n, s-u-n, of the Christed consciousness. It is with deep joy, deep beneficence and deepest gratitude that we give our heart-felt thanks to everyone who has participated all over the world in this Work, be they here tonight or be they here in the future; and everyone who has helped in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Godspeed to all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Ommm Shanti, Shanti Ommm.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I want to create a procedure for how to work this line when we have so many people on the line that are going through things. I wanted to suggest and you can make your own suggestion, that perhaps I should read their name, read their email and go through all of that and then just leave some silence to work with them, since we are not going to have time to get an individual answer for each person on this call.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">You can say, “Do we need to read their email, or can they just silently shut their eyes and ask for a healing? Can you notice them in that kind of circumstance?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. We are going to do that then. I am going to read everyone’s name. I might choose to say this problem or that problem. I’d like all of you who are on the line to shut your eyes and be open to receive, who is looking, whether you sent anything in or not, whether you have something wrong with you or not. If you don’t, then I want you to hold the space for those people who do have infirmities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It is our group energy that is the vehicle that brings these transmissions into the physical. We are very much a part of this action. It’s not them doing it to us; it’s them doing it with us. You, on the calls, who hold a higher space, you who have come in and have already connected spiritually; there are many of you on this call of that caliber. Use your intent in support of those people in greater need.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Let me go through some of the things; if I don’t have your name, then you put your name in. Shut your eyes and feel the energy. The energy comes in for most people, it comes in from the top of their head.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We’ve never done anything like this before; I consider this an experiment. I’d say a lot of the things we do are an experiment. I am not promising anything to anyone. I do know that we have had many situations where people have been on our line and things have shifted, sometimes major, sometimes minor. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Doing this in a public way may not work. This might be something that has to be done in a different way, in order to hold the sacred energy for what we’re doing. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">In the public, everyone on the call is part of the energy of the creation of the call. If we do this in the public, it can easily turn into something that suddenly people are attacking us for doing this; people are going to have their opinions about what we’re doing. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We’re just going to have to learn how to proceed. I wish you all a really good night. I sincerely wish that each of you gets what you are looking for out of this and I hope some of you will come to our workshop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

So that’s a more protected environment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
