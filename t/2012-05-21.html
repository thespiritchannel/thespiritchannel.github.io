<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">There’s this idea that the Illuminati is defeated, the positive is winning, we’re liberated; the bad guys are going to get locked up – even David Wilcock is saying that – and all we got to do is sit back and relax.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is, in general, not the information I’ve been getting.<span>&nbsp; </span>How do you figure out who to trust?<span>&nbsp; </span>If somebody says something, how do you know whether you can trust them or not?<span>&nbsp; </span>I start off by saying, “Don’t trust me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Test me.<span>&nbsp; </span>I test myself.<span>&nbsp; </span>I look for things that cross-reference things.”<span>&nbsp; </span>It's amazing how the universe keeps providing materials to me that kind of keeps validating the stuff I come up with, or the points of view that seem to make the most sense.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>I wrote the book about David Wilcock.<span>&nbsp; </span>David usually introduces his material, or often says, “My dreams have validated this; in my dreams it said this is true.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, because David was Edgar Cayce in his past life, there’s a great predisposition to think, “If Edgar Cayce/David doesn’t know what’s going on, then who can we trust?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">In the book I wrote, it said Edgar Cayce and David Wilcock both had negative sources at different times.<span>&nbsp; </span>Last week we talked about that to some extent.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve always said, in any channeling it is always possible to have a negative source come through.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s why I say to you,“Don’t believe our channelings; just watch them over time.”<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s why Carla Rueckert says, “If you want to avoid having a negative source, only ask questions that are universal truths, things that are true 10,000 years from now or 10,000 years past; like, how the universe works, etc.”<span>&nbsp; </span>When you ask a question which is temporal, in time:<span>&nbsp; </span>What’s going to happen next week?<span>&nbsp; </span>What’s going to happen in two weeks?<span>&nbsp; </span>Particularly if you ask it and you have the intent of some kind of empowerment, because you’re going to know the future – chances are ‘up there’ of getting a negative source.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">If you have any attachment to how people are thinking of you, keeping your audience, keeping the crowd connected to you – then, you always have to keep up coming up with new things so that people are always interested in coming back.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do my best to avoid those temptations; and we’ve been doing this now.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are people who keep coming back and we don’t have new things all the time.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, every Sunday, which is our most popular call, we do the same thing every Sunday.<span>&nbsp; </span>What I’ve learned:<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not about the information; it’s about the energy on the call.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you get the energy on the call, heck – who cares about the information?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">There are certain kinds of information that could be very valuable, like, “Is there an earthquake going to hit your city tomorrow?”<span>&nbsp; </span>It might be good to take a ride into the country that day if we knew that.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, if we knew that, we would tell you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe if we knew it and we got on the phone and we put It in the grid healing, it wouldn’t happen.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you see how convoluted it is?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">For example, I discovered a video today of David Wilcock interviewing somebody and he was talking about all this gold stuff…<span>&nbsp; </span>By the way, I should say:<span>&nbsp; </span>I think that David has some great spiritually uplifting things on his website.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you go deep enough into it, you’ll find meditations; he doesn’t call it Ra anymore; he calls it “Management” or “E.T.'s”.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think he just wanted to distinguish himself from past uses of the word ‘Ra’.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, is it Ra?<span>&nbsp; </span>Is that who is talking to him?<span>&nbsp; </span>I haven’t studied his work to say I feel the resonance of that, so I hope it is.<span>&nbsp; </span>I believe somewhere in the context of his work there’s really a lot of positive stuff.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, he’s talking about mass arrests, economic overthrow, etc, etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>He’s getting this information from talking to people who are “insiders.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Is it correct or isn’t it correct?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">First of all, in David’s track record over the past 10 years he’s made some major boo-boos.<span>&nbsp; </span>He talked about disclosure coming on a certain date; he talked about mass arrests coming on a certain date (that’s arrests of the negative); and, in the year 2000 – I don’t keep tabs on all these things, these are just the things that came to my attention – his website was called “Ascension </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">2000”</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">.<span>&nbsp; </span>The implication was we were all going to ascend in the year 2000.<span>&nbsp; </span>So David can certainly make mistakes, and it’s okay that he makes mistakes, because everybody makes mistakes.<span>&nbsp; </span>But – if somebody makes mistakes and they come out and they say something is going to happen, then I’m not sure you should assume that it’s going to happen.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">On the videos we did – the video project which I sent out – there was one called, ‘The Downside of Hope’ which is very good.<span>&nbsp; </span>They talk about this.<span>&nbsp; </span>They say, “If you’re going to be spiritually evolving, you have to be actively involved one way or another in your own life.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sitting around waiting for something to happen to save you is counter-productive.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even if something positive does happen down the road, if you’re not in the middle of your own life that’s not going to change it.<span>&nbsp; </span>People who are saying “Let’s wait for E.T.'s to land; let’s wait for – there’s something called Nesara where all debt is going to be released – let’s wait for Nesara and we’ll be financially free; let’s wait for Jesus…”<span>&nbsp; </span>Waiting is not a creative act; it’s a passive act – there’s no energy in waiting.<span>&nbsp; </span>So if you’re in the posturing of waiting then you might consider reviewing that because that is not going to shift your energies.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">In fact, if your energies are going to shift, it has to come from inside you.<span>&nbsp; </span>It can’t come from some external source that’s saving you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some external force can support what’s going on inside you, but if you notice our sources – they don’t take away our power, ever.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s one of the things that has led me to trust this work and to trust what comes through Terry over and over again because they don’t take over our power.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re always supporting us, where we are, in our own growth.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">When we first started talking to them, I expected them to, “Tell me what to do if you’re who you say you are, I certainly want to help; tell me what to do.”<span>&nbsp; </span>They never told me what to do.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m not sure they know exactly what to do; they know how to help us, they know how to support us in things we do as long as our intent is high.<span>&nbsp; </span>They don’t tell us what to do because that would turn us into a follower, would turn us into not coming from our own center.<span>&nbsp; </span>When somebody starts telling you what to do they become enslaved as well as you.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t know if you understand that, but they have to keep worrying about you:<span>&nbsp; </span>What are you doing now?<span>&nbsp; </span>Let me tell you what to do now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let me tell you what to do now.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Who wants to do that, at least for all eternity?<span>&nbsp; </span>We might do it to help somebody through a given time, but not through all eternity.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Are the positive winning? – that’s going to be our topic.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m going to be sure to give it some time to do some channeling.<span>&nbsp; </span>Interestingly enough, I don’t usually play channelings of anybody else, [but] I found a channeling of someone whom I’ve been exposed to before.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m not in the </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">position to say everything that comes through that channel is positive.<span>&nbsp; </span>I found one that kind of addressed this topic and I sent the download, the audio, to BBS who is going to play it – not just yet, but in a moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope Doug is listening.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s from a channel, the channel source is named ‘Bashar’ and the person who is doing the channeling is named Darryl Anka.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’ll see that Bashar is nothing like our sources, and comes in like a ton of bricks; very powerful.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems to me it’s not a group soul energy, it seems like it’s an individual high soul that’s highly intended, trying to contribute into this realm.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">There was – I’m going to have Doug play this, because many of the things he’s saying are things that have come through our channelings, like there are parallel worlds going on right now.<span>&nbsp; </span>You have to position your energy in one of those worlds and that’s the world you’re going to end up in.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s another way of saying ‘graduation’ – if you position yourself at a high enough level, you end up graduating this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is a multiplicity of other choices.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are sitting in fear that you’re going to starve to death, you’re going to run out of money, that the New World Order is coming – blah, blah, blah – you’ll end up in that world.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s the implication of what he said.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Doug, if you are ready and I hope you’re listening – you can play that session.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a pretty short session – go ahead.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">We take a look further and we see that there are parallel realities as in the Bashar tape.<span>&nbsp; </span>This may not be totally clear how this can happen.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, if you look at the densities you can see that each density is occurring at the same time.<span>&nbsp; </span>We take a look at the parallel realities that are available and occurring all at the same time on the different densities.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the top we do not consider this ranking.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a simple matter of an occurrence; we could call it an occurrence, we could call it a non-occurrence as this is an area that is outside of space and time.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is the very loving area, a very loving intelligence, that is the fountain out of which creativity and love and life stem.<span>&nbsp; </span>This encompasses and exists at the same time wherever and whenever an individual is wrapped in this, existing in this area of non-existence, but of total love and total bliss.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everyone within this framework is totally safe, totally loved – and, has the opportunity of whatever density they are in to explore and to bring as best they can their ideas and their creativity to fruition.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">The things that we look at are the inclination – we change the subject slightly here – the inclination of all beings within all the densities to wish, to strive, to bring harmony among all elements as individuals, at whatever level they are, take a look at the different aspects that they are confronted with and that they are using to build their life with, their manifest life.<span>&nbsp; </span>They look at all of these elements and choose what is of most significance to them to build a life that in some cases, is most harmonious for them and their survival.<span>&nbsp; </span>In other cases, to build a life in which all can have a chance and can grow.<span>&nbsp; </span>If a person chooses the service-to-self route, there are technical reasons for this.<span>&nbsp; </span>In some cases, it is earlier damage that has skewed their reactions and their looks (how they see things).<span>&nbsp; </span>At a very deep level, it is still the effort of that complex, that composite being to within the individual self, to achieve harmony, and it is within their own composite being that the problem is arising in service-to-self beings.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">We look at everyone everywhere going back to the original theme of the densities that everyone everywhere is wrapped within the love and the creativity of the all that is outside of space and time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even though they are lost, somewhere in space and time, and working through their issues, they still they are still held, loved and safe, whether they are service-to-others or service-to-self.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">When you ask if the positive has won, you need to look at the time period in which you are covering.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is it next week?<span>&nbsp; </span>Is it next year?<span>&nbsp; </span>Is it for 2012?<span>&nbsp; </span>Where are you looking at this?<span>&nbsp; </span>As it is an ever, ongoing evolution of individual souls and their growth processes and their struggles within whatever density they are finding themselves working through.<span>&nbsp; </span>So in the long run, there is a struggle in each individual, whether service-to-self or service-to-others, to come to a harmony.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Where is the point where these different realities actually separate so the physical reality that people experience becomes different?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">It is difficult for individuals who are within say a town and within the town there is a reality that is pervasive within the area which the individual is living in.<span>&nbsp; </span>This may color the individual’s look at things as they sit or stand in their house, the other realities of the individuals within the town pervade that individual.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unless they are very strikingly making their own reality and able to put it out without being colored by their surroundings, they may have trouble with moving unconsciously into the reality of the town, or the country.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, some of the individuals who are in the upper power structure know these things and can then slant the media to sway the individual consensus reality and put the people into a certain perspective that they have lost and this is going to take them over with vaccines or tsunamis or some disaster will take them over.<span>&nbsp; </span>It places the individual merely by hearing this, and groups the individuals hearing it all at one time are placed into a consensus reality of having to then consider that.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, it makes it a little bit harder to get over the hump of assuming the parallel reality where this might not happen to them.</span></p>

This is not meant to replace seeing your</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">doctor, dentist or any alternative practitioner. &nbsp;Some people</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">get healings here, so you can be open to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
