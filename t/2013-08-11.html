Every Sunday I keep thinking I got to play this one call, this one piece of music and I keep forgetting to upload it and I uploaded it this morning. And it was one of my favorite songs years ago. I remember playing it over and over and over and it still has that same effect on me. Carla probably remembers, Terry doesn’t remember. You know, Terry went through her early life in another zone. Everything kind of escaped her. Like if I mentioned a big hit song, most of them she never heard of, movies she’s never heard of, TV shows she’s never heard of, everybody knows. So it’s kind of like she was always somewhere else.</span></span></span></p>

So if you could try me on it that I might or might not recognize it. </span></span></span></p>

You know, in the beginning when you first starting coming into these calls, it’s like all these ideas felt mysterious and weird and “what are they talking about, can this be real?” And then suddenly after a certain period of time, we get to feel each other, not just on this call, but you can think about it, you can think about these Sources. Some of you are having experiences and this warm feeling comes up inside of you and you know, we are actually expressing what the song was talking about. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">You know, many people have that ideal that we’re connected and they talk about it like an ideal and here we are actually having the experience, honoring our freewill and no obligations, a freewill association of people putting their love in a pool every Sunday morning. And when I was younger somehow I knew that there was this promise and this song expressed the promise. But very few people actually move into the experience of the promise. You know what the song is, Carla?</span></span></p>

That’s the kind of song it you were a wanderer and you heard it, you would have to say, “Yeah!” ???? And of course, I remember playing it over and over and over again. And you know, I actually I met the guy who was singing that. And I use to think . . . one of the things is I always thought people that were singing songs would be the songs they were singing. So I expect it when I ran into him. He was on the West Coast and I was in Berkeley, that oh my God, I’m going to feel that song. But he was just a human, you know. It’s amazing. It’s the inspiration when you can come through, like lyrics like that were kind of channels. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">You know what? I have another song that I always wanted to play on Sunday. This is a good way to get the energy going too. This is a song that I remember the first time I heard it, it’s amazing that I remember this. I turned on the car radio and I was in high school and I think I was driving home from school and I played this song and it was the first time I remember going into ecstatic trance in a car while I heard a song, a piece of music. And of course, this was a song that was one of the early Motown songs and I ended up writing songs for the guy who wrote this years later when I went to Los Angeles. And I guess it created the model of how we wish someone else would be in our life and here we go. I’m being a Sunday morning disc jockey but it’s been months now that I wanted to play these two songs so I’m getting it off my chest. Of course, you call this low five, right? Could you understand the lyrics when I played “Get Together”?</span></span></p>

All of us came into this world and I think those of us who keep showing up on this line have to be wanderers. You wouldn’t be here. You know what? It’s interesting how people can look at something and evaluate it from their own perspective, their own belief patterns. And one person will come on to this call and they will experience the flow of love that happens. It just keeps going????? right through them. And they’ll say, “God, this was what I was always looking out for.” Another person will show up on this call and think, “What a bunch of wackos.” And you know, this is why it’s so important not to . . . we’ve talked about this before . . . not to hound people. Say, “You’ve got to listen to this, you’ve got to check this guy out.” Well, you can say that but you know. What if they’re one of those people that think we’re wackos and they happen to be a friend of yours, now they’re going to think you’re a wacko and you didn’t really want to be a wacko in their eyes, in fact you could have had a good relationship. But their structure, their belief system is not sensitive at this point to let these energies through. And the key to all of this, the people around you, is learning how to be there for them in the way they need someone as long as you can be authentic. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">I remember one time somebody said that they were rewriting the golden rule. And they said the golden rule got it wrong because the golden rule says of course, “Love people and treat people in the way you want to be treated.” And he said that if he had written it, he would have written it, “Treat people in the way they want to be treated.” And I thought that was very interesting because how about if the person doesn’t want to be treated the way you do? They have different needs and are you sensitive to their needs and treating them the way their needs need to be met. Did you ever hear that before, Carla?</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Carla:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> No I didn’t, but I think it’s a valid point and it’s something that we often miss. We ???? assume that all of our desires are the same but obviously I need to take that very, very extreme example that you’re a sadist, then what you want is to hurt somebody. And if you’re a masochist then what you want is to be hurt as odd as that sounds. So, you definitely couldn’t work the golden rule as it reads. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> Well, actually if one guy was a sadist and the other was a masochist you could probably . . . </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Carla:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> A marriage made in Heaven.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> But you know, looking for the right thing out in the world. Looking for the circumstance that fills you. Looking for the person that is going to love you in the way you think you need to be loved. Looking for the friend who is going to honor you and be a good friend. And then often times people give up. They say, “I’m not going to find it.” And they’re probably right. They may not be, maybe they will find it. And then they say, “It’s a dog eat dog world, I got to care of myself, I got to survive.” And when you find somebody like that, that’s the time, don’t judge them because that’s the time to extend compassion. That’s the time to test your ability to care, to be compassionate. And to be compassionate without getting hooked in their stuff because that’s the trick that people will try to hook you all the time. And it’s the great sensitivity to keep your intuitive feelings open and you can tell when someone reaches back. You can tell when the energy comes towards you. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And what we’re doing we’re developing a miss call. We’re developing a, what’s the word? It’s not even a, I was going to say a psychic rapport? You know we’ve read a long time that in the new earth we’re going to be telepathic. And perhaps on these calls we’re having moments of telepathy. Now I don’t think I’m telepathic. I watched my own quality and know I’m very intuitive. And I’ve watched myself do amazing things in my life, but I don’t even know how I’m doing them. I observe them and I say, “How did I do that?” </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">I can try to put words on it like for an example, let me see. We were doing a talk somewhere, I think it was in Carlsbad. And we had this waitress coming into the restaurant taking care of us and she came to the table, was taking our order and I was talking to her and I just got this image and I said what I was thinking. It was like I was in her being and I could feel something. And I wasn’t trying to be in her being, I wouldn’t have ever intruded in somebody like that. It was just there. It was like I was feeling like I was her. And Terry was there, I think, when this happened. I don’t mind ???? “Was your father a policeman?” And she said, “Yes.” Was that psychic? And it was something we call psychic. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">But really, psychic-ness is empathy. It’s allowing yourself to become one with another person. Now if I had to go around calling myself psychic, then it would be like I’m trying to sell you on the fact that I have this special power. And wouldn’t you like to meet somebody that can tell what everybody’s thinking? But it doesn’t work that way for me. I don’t want to be thought of as special. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">You know, as soon as people think of you as special they have have a very strong projection of who you are which blocks you from connecting with them empathetically. I think everyone who is sensitive that ends up being a public person has to constantly overcome this propensity because people will walk up to you, even you guys will walk up to me and you’ll think you know me and you do know me, this is like the paradox of it. But in that moment it’s a new creation. And when someone walks up to you holding the thought form of a past creation, it stops the creation of the new moment. And so people that are in the public have to constantly . . . either they stay home or they come out for their moments of glory which that works. Or they learn how to reframe, recreate situations so they can be in the moment and it’s a new way of creating infinity. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4">More really striking examples of that with me was when </span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce</i></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> came out. And when it came out I was invited to this part in San Diego, it was on ???? beach, which is an upscale area and it was this beautiful house of a therapist. I cannot remember how he heard about me. And it was all these new agey people going there and I remember thinking, this is going to be my crowd, these people are going to love me, I’ve written The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And I walked in the door of this party and the guy who had invited me started introducing me to everybody. And I said, ah, this is really cool, I’m meeting all these great people and as soon as he introduced me there would be a stream of questions that would come from the person. “Oh, he’s back! Does he do readings? Where does he live?” You know and I felt the social obligation, at first, I felt the social obligation to answer their questions. And I started answering the questions and I realized I was totally wasting my time. And I said, “Who cares where he lives? Who cares if he does readings?” </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And then people would keep coming in and he would keep introducing me and when they started asking me questions, I tried something, I said, “I don’t answer those questions. But if you ask me what’s really important, I’ll tell you.” And so then they would start to say, “Ok, what’s really important?” And then I would start talking about the dimensional shift, group souls and all of that stuff. At least I was making a little headway. And then I got bored with that because it was in such a social chit-chat environment that I couldn’t connect with the energy. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And so I went into the backyard of this guy’s beautiful home. And he had a beautiful backyard, waterfalls. And I sat in a corner away from everybody. And I sat there and someone sat next to me and then someone else sat next to me. And before you know it, the two people who were sitting next to me were talking to each other. And there were three people sitting next to me and four people sitting next to me. And of course, this is in a lonely section of the backyard. And for some reason people would sit next to me. I didn’t immediately start talking about the book I had written, I just implied it???? . After about five or ten minutes these people were all engaged with each other and they had a really good energy. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And I got up and excused myself and I went across to the other side of the backyard and I sat down again and the same thing happened. People started sitting next to me and talking to each other. And I realized I was being of more service holding the space and letting people meet each other than by being the center of attention and talking about my book. Eventually, I ended up pulling out my guitar and playing music and people loved it. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">You know, Carla is obviously a bigger celebrity than me in certain circles and I’m sure she knows the experience of walking into a room and having people have these expectations of her because they have been touched by her material. I’m I right Carla?</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Carla:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> Well actually, I do not mean to contradict you but no. For the most part people don’t know who I am and the place where people who are impressed by who I am are mostly in your mind. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Wynn: </b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4">In my mind?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Carla:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> In your mind, yeah. Because I don’t think I have a lot of people who know who I am, I think that I have the really fortunate luck not to be famous and I hope that I get to be famous soon after I die. Because then nobody will have any expectations of me at all and they can’t use me as an opinion football or an expectation football. And maybe the work that our resource organization has done through the years will tell its own story. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">No, for the most part I have gone through life completely unknown. And I have to say although it has not been the very best thing when you talk about how to make money, I haven’t seen much money from our work. I haven’t seen much at all. But at least I’ve been allowed to be free to do the work. And I know that I’m really luck that way. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">So I don’t repondre because of the fact that I’m not well known. I think I would be absolutely terrified if people started introducing me and going, “Oh, of course. She’s so famous.” And then I would be expected to be this or that. Because I never had a lot of luck fitting into other people’s categories. I don’t know how in the world I would start having much luck now. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">I’m sorry, this is not helping you, is it?</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> Oh, it’s helping. Say, listen. We’re supposed to be authentic and how well when????? people will come to your homecoming?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Carla:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> Oh well, yeah. There’s no question about that and I just grin a lot and thank people a lot and try to stay out of the way because as you say, it’s about the people, it’s not about me. I love it, I love that whole energy that happens. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">People come to our homecoming and almost to a man or should I say to a person, they haven’t had a lot of luck talking about the things that really interests them with anybody. And they come to the homecoming and all of a sudden they’re with twenty-five, thirty, forty people that really want to know what they think and don’t think they’re crazy and glad to talk about anything that they want to talk about. Because of the fact the Law of One is such a great shelter of people that it brings out the true, honest seekers. Those that are seeking really hard and I think that that’s the way that people find out about the Law of One is when they’re seeking really hard. And then it drives the Law of One to them. It’s like then they can’t help hearing but hearing about it. But if they haven’t gotten that far yet then they won’t hear about it because they’re probably not ready to enjoy it, not ready to appreciate it and it would go zip, right over their heads. And so that seems to be the way it works. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">So I really feel lucky when I watch what happens at homecoming it’s just marvelous. But it isn’t about me. It’s not at all about me and I think people sense that. And if they don’t sense that I state it, I state right out clear, you know, I’m just me, I’m just an idiot, a bozo like everybody. But I was fortunate enough because I really, really wanted to serve that we ended up caring this material and thank Heaven for it and here it is for free and I’m so glad that you can use it. And that’s sort of the way people know me and I think they’re use to me that way. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> You know, that San Diego party was such a lesson for me. And we’re talking to a bunch of people and many of the people talking to didn’t write books, don’t walk into a room. And I know that that at one stage of my evolution in this lifetime. There is a time that I wanted everybody to recognize me. I wanted to walk into a room and have people say, “There he his.” And I think often times people have feeling, they want to have the acknowledgement of other people. And here when I was getting it, all I wanted to do was sit alone in the back and get away from everybody. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And I realized I put something together that the greatest service in this life is putting together circumstances where people meet each other, where people come together. And they come together in a higher vibration so they’re outside of their normal set of projections. And they can come together with a higher set of rules of conduct. And they come together and they know the game at a higher level and they have the opportunity to play the game with each other at a higher level than they normally might attract which is what you do in your homecoming, I would guess. They’re paying attention to you but they’re in the same physical space. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">Carla, why don’t we do a homecoming at your house?</span></span></p>

Because of the fact I’m flat on my back right now and can’t get off of it. It’s actually the very best because people can’t spend much time talking to me because they would have to leave the rest of the homecoming and come into the room where I am and visit for a while with me but they’d have to give up everybody else to do that. And nobody wants that. </span></span></span></p>

The structure that we have is the people who want to can offer a program of whatever they want to, whatever they would like to offer. And so some people will offer a share of the moment, say, when they first ran into The Law of One. And some people will share how The Law of One helped them through a certain problem with their life. And some people will share what they do for a living that may be of interest to some of the people there. And it goes on like that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">I have shared and shared and shared as far as teaching. And I’ve decided that probably people have had plenty of that by now. So I decided this I was going to offer my folk songs. And I’ve worked up about a half hour of acapella folk songs. And I have always found them fascinating because they tell the story of how great groups of people moved from one continent to another and the same song might have been found in the seventeenth century in Ireland or in England. And then the people gravitated to the United States and they bring the songs with them. And then they’re American songs and things happen to the songs because it’s a whole different culture. Like in one song they changed the ???? to include bundling. And bundling was something that happened in the eighteenth century and they would put a board down the middle of a bed and wrap quilts around it and a courting couple could lie on the bed on either side of the bundling board and do anything they could do while not going over the board. So it sort of kept them from going too far. </span></span></p>

And it must have sounded absolutely extraordinary and I couldn’t stop because I couldn’t figure out how to get started again and how it sound ?????? So I kept on going like that. One hand finished and then eventually the other hand finished and somebody came up to me and said, “Wow!

Did you ever think of that?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"><b>Carla:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span size="4"> I didn’t actually, but it’s a good thought.

And they’re here energetically. I know they’re here. I soon as I start talking about them, can you feel the energy shift? It’s so interesting. I do. Maybe I’m crazy but I always feel the energy shift when I talk about them and it’s like in that party in San Diego. While I was sitting there and people would sit around me and then I would get up and go somewhere else, I didn’t get that the people that sat down next to me knew what I was doing. I was holding the space but I think they didn’t get that. It was just like, oh, I just show up, here I am, I’ll sit down here. See, it’s those little decisions people make. I’ll sit down here, this looks like a good energy here. But it happens on such a subconscious level, they don’t realize why they’re making decisions. And they didn’t know I was creating an environment for that to occur. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And when we’re sitting here talking and having such wonderful comradery and sharing our experiences and that you’re sharing with us, all of you here sharing the space of it. We’re doing this because on some level or another there are these awareness’s??? in other dimensions that have been the cause of this coming together. And if you just imagine that every time we meet like this they are silently sitting in the background saying how wonderful they’re getting together. How wonderful, this is how life on earth was supposed to be. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And we’re setting an example here, we’re not competing with each other. You all are here right with us. You know, for you to be right with us, right now, you have to be in another dimension because humans can’t do that. Humans are stuck in their bodies. So you have to be in the part of yourself that’s jumping out of your body and moving beyond space so that we can meet in a space beyond space.</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And then we have these group soul energies that we can’t see, but as soon as we talk about them, as soon as I talk about them, it’s been my experience, there is an energy shift. And they think about from their point of view how they’re looking at humanity and they’re looking at the suffering that takes place down here. And I don’t think the Elohim, assuming they are who they say they are and they created this realm, I don’t think they intended all this suffering to occur. But they granted freewill and so once there was physicality there were possessions and there was competition and people, the beings here, for a great majority, lost their connection with the Law of One principle. </span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span face="Calibri, serif" style="font-family: Calibri, serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">And the Law of One principle just means that I can see me in you, that’s all it means. Not some big philosophy. It means that I see me in you, then we’re compassionate, we have comradery. And this realm lost that. And these group souls are watching, I don’t know if “watching” is the right word because they don’t have eyes, but they ???? by sensing us and it’s not quite clear how it feels to be them and to sense us, but we know they do. And then they can move in and connect with our energy fields and when they do that, which happens every Sunday for many people on this call. When they do that, it’s such an expansion for us down here and it’s friends in high places in a way that we never in our wildest imagination dreamed was possible. </span></span></p>

We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet Earth, through our bodies and anchored into the center of the Earth. And right now we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. And we invite those sources that are positive, service to others, honoring the Law of One to join with us. And we create a protected space that only the positive has access to.

So when the call is over, during the week communication is a big solvent, it is a bridge that can help one get from where one is to where one wants to be, can begin to let another know how they need to be understood.
