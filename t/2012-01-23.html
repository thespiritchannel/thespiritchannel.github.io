<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I picked a topic tonight; I thought of doing this for quite some time. We’ve done shows before on the story of Terry and Saint Catherine, but I’ve never actually picked up the book called <i>Saint Catherine’s Dialogues with God</i>. Its 398 pages and I’m going to read some of it tonight.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Saint Catherine was a young lady. The interesting thing to look at is when we think of people who have become famous or known in history or recognized, it’s hard to realize they were human. It seems like there was something special about them; they could do things that other people couldn’t do; they exhibited their talents.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When I look at it myself I see that someone may come into this realm that has some exceptional ability but until they have the right life-circumstance, they may never exhibit their exceptional abilities and they end up having a hum-drum life; they die young.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">So it’s not to exalt somebody because otherwise we don’t want to talk about it. There are people who would exalt Terry. I try to make myself un-exaltable, so we get around that. Terry’s shy and so if somebody starts to exalt her and think, “I’m sitting here with Saint Catherine”, it’s very uncomfortable because Terry is not Saint Catherine and when she was Saint Catherine she wasn’t a saint. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">She was probably this person that would go into a church, a monastery and whoever was in the monastery could hold the space for her to bring through messages. For all I know, I could have been there. You never know; I seem to be a good space-holder for that. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It was the circumstance where she was 14 years old and she would show up in the monastery and somehow or another it got started. I don’t know how. That’s interesting, how things get started. That’s always a momentous moment, as in the story of Daphne and myself when we were driving to Portland and I said, “Does anybody want to talk to me?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Keep in mind I have known Terry for at least thirty years now. When I first met Terry—I’ll just tell you how that occurred. I was at a point where my world had fallen apart and I needed to make money. The way I was making money at that time was doing work for this fellow who had this big hotel chain and he went bankrupt. When he went bankrupt, all my eggs were in that basket.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I had this idea that I could do anything; I was very confident in myself. I said, “All these people are doing multi-level marketing.” Somebody had given me this tablet that said it boosted your energy and I put it under my tongue and I thought it worked and I said, “Boy, this would be easy to sell.” So I went down to a meeting of this company that was selling flower pollen.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Here was the person talking at the meeting who was so sincere and so passionate; there was no multi-level marketing hype about it. She believed in the product and she didn’t look like a seasoned MLM speaker, but she really won the audience. She kept looking at me like she wanted to get to know me.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

In fact, I thought she was pretty wacky. Can I say that? I can say that. People, you can say I’m wacky; we’re both wacky. You have to be wacky to do this. I thought Terry was wacky and she had all these crazy ideas.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">At one point she was fascinated with channeling and she had discovered this woman who was holding little sessions in her home in Culver City and Terry would go to her sessions. One time she had Terry go up and suddenly Terry was channeling. I didn’t see it; I wanted nothing to do with it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">On a subconscious level I was very nervous about allowing myself to become exposed to channeling, because I felt that it could tempt someone, could tempt me to give up my power. If a source that was channeling, I didn’t know if it was real; I didn’t know there were beings in other dimensions. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The only person I was ever was really influenced by was Edgar Cayce and that’s because Edgar Cayce was so validatable; he wasn’t just coming through and talking about love and light. He could be so precise and so accurate and I read many books about him with excerpts from his readings.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">If you’re dealing with a positive Source, they are not interested in just talking to talk. They would understand that there are a lot of cautions as we always say about channeling. It’s so easy to get a negative source or a mixed-polarity source and it often starts out with a connection with a positive Source that goes sour. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">They would have to look at people very carefully if they were going to decide to talk through them and even then they’re probably still taking a risk. They know that if you’re going to go around and say, “We’ve got this voice that says they’re the Elohim talking to me”, you’ve already created a hierarchy or a predisposition for someone to give up their power, because the Elohim is so highly recognized historically; it’s a word that’s been used.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I really couldn’t understand why they identifed themselves to me with the name Elohim; I would have probably preferred that they said they were the Council of Light. We know other people who channel the Council of Light or the Light Brigade or whatever and we think it’s the Elohim, but they don’t say it. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">To them it’s not a matter of how they’re named; it’s a matter of how they can be of influence; that’s for both group souls. How can they be of influence in this realm? It’s a challenge to be of influence here, because you have to be willing to stick your neck out and talk about things that are so out there, controversial, that challenge people’s reality systems. Then you have to be very highly intended so that you don’t start out positive and end up compromised.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Obviously Saint Catherine was very much using the Jesus template. What I see, this is my take; if anyone is highly religious, I don’t think this is in conflict with that, but it’s a different way of looking at it. According to our questions and answers, my cross-references with David Wilcock and Carla Rueckert, when Jesus said <i>Father,</i> it was the Ra group that was communicating with Him. In our channelings they said it doesn’t matter. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In what we call The One Infinite Creator, it’s all of us; it’s part of us; we are that. For The One Infinite Creator to communicate with us it would have to separate from being The One Infinite Creator, because it’s all The One Infinite Creator. The Elohim are aspects of The One Infinite Creator; you and I are aspects of The One Infinite Creator. It’s the subsets of the aspects that are the emissaries at whatever level they come in to hold that space.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Jesus was an aspect of The One Infinite Creator and he was directly connected to the Ra group. As I studied all of this, which is a whole other story, the Ra group had carefully planned the entry of Jesus into this realm. It’s not different and this doesn’t supersede the religious point of view; it includes it; it’s just a little bigger. All this stuff we’re talking about is very sophisticated, compared to what people could actually accept at different times.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">With regard to religion, some people make connections to Spirit through religion and some people don’t; the religion becomes the end instead of the means. As I would look at it, the Ra group was attempting to create a person who could hold the space, or bring a person into this realm who could hold the space of multi-dimensional consciousness.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">He could hold the space of their chakras being opened, their DNA being opened; and that when someone does that, other people feel it and they start evolving their DNA. That’s how people grow down here; they don’t grow because they believe in something. They grow because they’ve been in the presence of fields that are higher than theirs and those fields start to teach them how to evolve their own fields.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">If Jesus was doing that and then Saint Catherine came in sometime about 1366, what is she going to say that is going to be so profound? How does it fit in with how we know the Ra group has communicated in current time? I have the book here and I marked a few pages; I’m not sure what page I’m going to read. Keep in mind we have 400 pages here and we don’t know that it’s all the Ra group; we don’t even know that it’s all positive. You will have to make your own judgment. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">As soon as you give up your power to “Uh oh – it’s the Ra group” or “Uh oh – it’s Jesus” and you start believing everything, then you’re now putting it in your mind and it’s not going into your heart and your system.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">You start following rules, you start doing rituals and you think that’s enough to “save you”. Maybe it is for some people; maybe it works for some people. But in general, it’s that aspect of human nature that wants to follow an authority, instead of following their own authority. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

They have to stay in that field of energy until they become strong enough to hold it inside themselves. Ultimately the goal is to have your own authority, to have your own Divine connection.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

For most of my life I had a terrible problem with authority, I probably still do, because it’s so easy to disempower yourself and surrender to someone else. I’ve discovered the things that work best; the things that you can learn from, to develop your own sense of authority. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">One thing I’ve learned since we’ve been doing these calls is, in essence, I’m the authority on these calls. I pick the topics; I decide who I can delegate anything to and I’m in charge, because somebody has to pay attention to things to keep them from getting corrupted.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">What I noticed is that if I delegate something to someone, there are some people who will do everything I say and need a lot of hand-holding to do things and there are other people that are totally independent. I’ve learned that there is Divine authority and there is human authority. If a guy owns a business, he’s the authority of that business; he decides who is going to work for him and who doesn’t. If you have a home, you’re the authority of your home; you decide who you would let into it and who you wouldn’t, in most cases.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">That is nature of this realm; there are domains of authority. If you’re living in a city and the city has laws, you are under the domain and the authority of those laws. If you belong to a certain church, you are under that authority. You can’t get away from authority; that is part of this realm. The key is: Can you operate from Divine Authority? Can you connect with the Law of One so that even when you’re under the auspices of someone else’s authority, it doesn’t trap you? You can use that positioning just to be of higher service.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

They’re very independent; they’re not depending on me. If we talk, it’s a co-creative conversation; it’s not like following orders. Some people can’t develop that kind of relationship. At least they can’t at this point or right at this moment; everyone can ultimately. It’s a good thing to aim for; look at your own aspect of needing authority.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

When you ask a question they give a lot of information and then they’ll say, “But you decide” and they’re consistent in that; so on many aspects, they’ve developed a lot of trust between me and them because they are that way.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Of course they’re always under the auspices of the church, so they have to honor the church and the way people have adopted Jesus as a reference point for higher connection. If somebody does that, that’s okay.</span></p>
