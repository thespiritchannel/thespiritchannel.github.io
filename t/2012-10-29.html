<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I announced a topic tonight. This is going to be kind of one of those informational calls, because I had a chance to review a little bit of the Ra Material. I thought that there was a lot of stuff that people would be interested in. There are so many specific questions that Don Elkins asked Carla Rueckert about this period of time. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I’ll just do a quick introduction on who Ra is as I see it; as they describe themselves and as I see it. In the initial stages of my conversations with Daphne, I asked a number of questions about Ra. I was trying to figure out “Am I wacko? Is this real?” because the story was so out there, my conscious mind – anyone who is discovering this for the first time, our work – has got to go through this. It’s so science-fiction-y; it’s like “Could this be real?” I welcome you: Keep going through it, keep studying our materials, keep listening to our calls. It’s not something you can integrate and believe the first time. Even when you do start to believe it, your mind will say “Am I making a mistake? Could this be real?” It takes some time to integrate it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">It’s not the belief that’s so important; it’s not having a belief system that’s correct. But, it’s learning that there are energies in other dimensions that we can make connection with in this dimension, and that operate honoring free will; that they can do many, many things to help us personally [and] to help our planet. But, we have to make a connection with them, or else they may not do it. By hearing who they are [and] how they operate, it gives you a little bit better mental introduction to what you’re looking for. If you just aim ‘out there’ and think “Okay, Ra – come to me” as I’ve learned, it’s very highly possible – and even likely – you’ll get a negative source that answers you in some way or another. It might even say it’s Ra or the Elohim and it may not be. It could be leading you into a path of perdition. In fact, the history of mankind is totally jaded by that particular thing that I just described where negative sources come through [and] talk to people. They think it’s the same source that spoke to Jesus and the same source that spoke to whomever, and they go totally in a wrong direction.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Why do you think, of all the religions in the world, that all say “Love your brother as yourself”, that “We’re all one” and that shortly down the road they start saying “We’re the best one; we’re the only path to God.” [It’s] going to the point where they even justified killing other people, other religions, other indigenous people because they’re the best. There’s got to be a reason for it, and I’m telling you the reason right now: it’s because people start reaching and they want to have something talk to them. And, they will get a negative source almost invariably.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I was aware of this possibility from my initial studies of stuff, and I had to very, very carefully – for probably a few years, as did Terry – have to weigh all the things that were happening, all the things that were being said. Even with that, I think there were certain times where there were negative sources that came through because I was not sharp enough to figure it out at first.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Basically, they came through – but, unless I kept asking for them they went away. What they want is: they want to create a bond with someone down here that says “I want to talk to so-and-so” and you think you’re special because you’ve got somebody talking to you. You don’t realize that you’ve got a negative source.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">The key element about negative sources is that – on some level – they have an agenda; they want followers. They want you to give them energy. They – in the worst cases – start dealing with the elite. They tell the elite the agenda; some of you are aware of elite agendas. A lot of this was explained in the Ra Material.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Let’s look at the universe and how the universe works – we are all in our little lifetime here on earth; our little, miniscule lifetime, one lifetime. According to what we’ve learned, this is one lifetime of a thousand, or even more. When we die, we move into an energy-form; we move into another dimension or another timeline. That energy form keeps coming back and having more bodies. Every time you come back, you forget everything, but you carry the matrix of your energy-form. So, if you have talents you can suddenly – like, I had learned that I was a troubadour – years ago I picked up a guitar and I immediately got into it and started writing songs. Things down here that you run into trigger you into opening up this computer – which you could call your soul – and bring in various aspects of your past experiences in this realm. You could meet somebody that you knew in a past lifetime and there’s immediate love, or you could meet somebody that did you in and there’s immediate mistrust.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">According to the way Ra explains it, you go through loads of time in this realm. Then, you graduate into the fourth density and you go through loads of lifetimes in the fourth density. I believe it could have been up to millions of our years. Keep in mind where they are, time moves at a wholly different speed. They’re monitoring us over many lifetimes and we’re kind of in this very slow track in our lives in this lifetime. We keep moving through the densities to the point where we don’t have to come back and take a body anymore; we don’t need a physical body. We end up as pure energy.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">All of these energetic individuations, these pure energies, team up. It takes millions of years of evolution to get to that point. They team up, and now there’s millions and millions or billions of them, and they’re pure energy in another dimension. They act as – they voluntarily to choose to act – as a helper and a guide for planets at lower levels of evolution like ours. That is who the Ra group is. They work closer in; they work with plans, they plan things. They work with people over time through history to bring events about. They do things on behalf of giving us opportunities to evolve ourselves.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">What is evolution in a human body all about? It’s connected with the triggering of DNA strands, and DNA strands get triggered because they’re in the field of energy of a higher energy than their own strands. This is a whole topic that we’ve talked about before; it’s like there are twelve DNA strands in most humans. Two [DNA strands] are activated; in many humans, the third is activated. The first seven strands relate to the first seven chakras. The next five strands relate to expanding yourself outside of your body.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">If you come to our Sunday grid healings and we do that meditation and you feel those energies moving through your bodies, it’s my contention that as we feel those energies we are helping to evolve; open up our DNA strands. The key for graduation from the third density is opening up your fourth DNA strand slightly more than half. To do that, your heart needs to be open.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">People wonder what an open heart is. It’s not about being nice, it’s not about doing charity – although those are both good things to do, and they certainly help. It’s actually an emanation and a radiation from your heart center. When you’re able to do that, it shifts the space that you are in; it uplifts it vibrationally in a way that other people who are ready can also feel it. They start lifting it themselves.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Some people have marriages and they think “My husband doesn’t understand this open heart stuff.” The key to it is, when you open up your heart and you put those emanations out, your husband – or your wife – can’t help but feel it. Sometimes people can do it right within their relationship; it’s a great way to open energies up through intimacy. Intimacy is one of the best ways – if you have it in the right way – to open up your heart and higher chakras because it’s a transfer of energy from heart-to-heart. It’s not romantic love; it’s beyond that, it’s above that. Some of you might know the experience, or you’ve had it, but what happens is because it feels so good and it starts opening your energies up, everybody wants to possess it. As soon as you try to possess it, the energy starts slipping away.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">There was an English poet that said “He who catches the joy as it flies lives in eternity’s sunrise; but, he who binds himself to a joy does the winged life destroy.” You can’t control another person; you can’t make them give to you. You can inspire them to give to you, they can feel you and out of compassion they make you feel better and you can make them feel better. But, as soon as you think you can control it; as soon as you think it’s like a switch you can turn on and off you usually lose it – usually – because it comes from the spontaneity of the moment. It comes through the giving from your center to another of your being. In that exchange of being, it opens your heart; it opens those energies.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">If you’re lucky enough to have a person, then you might try to figure out how you can move your relationship from where it is – assuming it’s not at that place; some of you may have it at that place – but, move it from where it’s not to that place where it could be. That is a great way to be open.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">In any case, when there’s a community of high-minded people – all these things – these are ways to open your energies: coming into our calls, coming into Team Shift (teamshift.intelligent-infinity.com). I don’t talk about it too much because I’m afraid we’ll get too many people and we won’t be able to manage it. If you’re hearing me and you feel like you need connection with other people, read that page and see if it fits you.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Now we have Ra, who is this group soul of beings that have graduated this realm. They call themselves like a whole planet of beings – a social memory complex – and they interact with us. If you’ve been following our calls, it’s not a trivial interaction. In fact, there’s indications that Jesus was one of these beings that graduated and came back. Not only that, at the time Carla Rueckert did her Ra work, they said there’s 65 million people on this planet that came back from their group to be of service here. They said, also, that 90% of them – when they come back, they get lost. They caught back up in the maelstrom – ‘maelstrom’ was the word they used; the traps in this realm.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">You come in through parents; you pick up how your parents attitudes are. You’re brought up in a neighborhood; you have a religion. You came in from a higher realm and you keep trying to figure it all out – all of you who are listening know you went through that – and, when you got to this work we’re doing it said “Click, click; this makes sense.” It may not make sense for everybody, but it’s making sense for a lot of people. Someone that comes back into this realm and gets lost has to discover something – in most cases – that will trigger them back into these realizations and help reconnect them with their soul family which for many people is the Ra group; for others, it’s the Elohim group. However much it sounds like I understand this, I don’t. I’m putting together all the pieces as my little earth-mind is able to comprehend it and the questions I’ve asked. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">When we expand ourselves – when you feel yourself expanded – and we’re moving into these other dimensions, how does it feel? It doesn’t feel like you’re leaving your body; you’re not astral-traveling. You’re in your body and you’re expanded and you feel that sense of expansion which many of you have experienced on our calls and on our lines. It’s like you’re positioning yourself – you’re mapping yourself – into other realms. As you map yourself and you learn to hold the space of where you mapped yourself while you were alive – that is what is going to determine the potential for your future lives, where you have mapped yourself in this lifetime.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">For most people, the fourth density is one of the next locations in their evolution – that’s for most people. But for many of you, it’s higher than that – you have the potential to end up in a fifth density world or a sixth density world. You’re mapping yourself in your ability to expand. This is not a competitive race to be as high as you can go. This is like you’ve got to go at your pace; you have to be patient. It’s kind of like: you don’t take somebody in second grade and put them in twelfth grade because they will fail. They will perish. It’s part of evolution. If someone is able to map themselves to a higher place than you, they’re not better than you. They’ve just spent more time in this realm than you have. You’ve got to pay your dues spending the time.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">The goal for many of us is to go to fourth density, to go to this higher realm. By the way – I’ve come to understand that the negative exists in fourth density, fifth density [and] part of sixth density; not at all in seventh density, just a little bit in sixth density. What happens is, the higher in the densities you go the higher negative you can be; you get into black magic, you get into occult control systems. This world is a mish-mash of negative and positive. As Ra has put it, you can evolve up through the densities by either path: the negative and the positive, or service-to-self and service-to-others. With service-to-self, you need a 95% dedication to service-to-self. With service-to-others, you need a 51% dedication to service-to-others, which means you can be almost half pretty bad and still graduate this realm.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">What does it mean to be service-to-self? What does it mean to have 95% dedication to self? Let’s think of a movie star who makes all the money in the world, who can pay for people to take care of them, to massage them – basically, [he] set himself up with a bunch of slaves. He made himself loads of money and everyone adores him. He always looks good, because he’s always being taken care of. Yet, he can be service-to-self. There’s a very slight kind of adjustment between service-to-self and service-to-others. On one hand, you do have to make yourself happy; you can’t just – well, you could; I’m not saying this is wrong – you could just sacrifice yourself for everyone else. Eventually, you’ll have no money; you’ll have no time. You’ll be crazy. There is a balance where you do a better job for other people by taking care of yourself. If you’re not taking care of yourself, if you’re not keeping yourself happy, how can you lift other people?</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Now we have this group soul – the Ra group – at one time early on I asked a question about the Ra group; the way the question was written to give you an idea of some of the things the Ra group does. There were two planets in our solar system that both had life: one was Mars and the other was Maldek. Maldek blew itself up and became the asteroids. Through Carla Rueckert, the Ra group had said that they moved the souls of the Maldekians and the Martians to Earth; they could actually move souls from one place to another. The Ra group administrates that.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">They also say – this is one of the interesting things when I was questioning Daphne in our initial channelings – I was trying to ask all these questions that I had learned from the David Wilcock material and the Carla Rueckert material. My mind was a bit spinning; I said, “Let me ask and see if I get the same answers.” They did give – almost straight across the board – the same answers as were coming through Carla Rueckert’s material – the Ra group. It was indicated in this shift that our planet is going through that those people that were going to be what the Ra group called “cycle repeaters” who were going to get their soul energies moved to another planet to repeat this realm; to repeat third density, to repeat the lessons of power and individuality. That’s the lesson of this realm: power and individuality. The lesson of the fourth density is compassion and empathy. Those people that are graduating are going to be in a realm of compassion and empathy.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I had the question “How can you have negative in a realm of compassion and empathy?” I even asked that to Carla in a private conversation, because I didn’t understand it. She said – and I got it – “You just love yourself. If you’re loving yourself and you attract all this energy to yourself, your heart energy is open.” It’s all about directing energy in manipulative ways to keep it open. The key element between service-to-others and service-to-self is free will; free will, because we all need things. We all have our shadow side.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We need things: we need food, we need money, we need sex – some of us – we need whatever we need. If don’t have those things, we suffer, some of us. I’m not saying everyone; some people don’t, but most of us suffer if we don’t have certain needs met. Those needs are not bad; you’re not supposed to feel guilty about them because they’re part of your animal, human side. You’re in a body! Shakespeare said “To thine own self be true,” be honest with yourself. The key to needs is: Can you fulfill your needs out of free will, and not out of manipulation, trickery, slavery etc. etc.? That is where the balance-point is between service-to-self and service-to-others.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Service-to-self fulfills their needs any way they can; they don’t worry about being honest, they don’t worry about who they screw, they don’t care who they say they love and leave. They just fulfill their needs any way they can. When you’re service-to-others, if you’re going to work on that, you have to learn to fulfill your needs in very honest, authentic ways in relationship with other people in real ways. Otherwise, you lose it; you start falling backwards. If you’re going to be service-to-self, you’ve got to do it big-time if you want to keep evolving. Otherwise, you get stuck in the same place.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">It’s a lot easier, in the long run, to honor free will. That is why free will is so crucial to the soul groups we talk about. People say, “Why don’t you just do this or fix that or do this?” They won’t do it. We are on our own path and they can help us. In the Ra material – in general on the other side – there’s a group from the Orions which are generally considered the bad guys, the service-to-self bent on planetary conquest, responsible for a lot of the negative that comes through here. They can channel and there’s ten times more of the Ra group than there are of the Orions. Except: the Orions don’t worry about asking. They will do anything to get a foot-hold; they will say they’re the Ra group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">In Egypt – somewhere around 10,000 B.C. – there was a big intervention of the Ra group in this realm. They built the pyramids by levitation. They were working with an Egyptian priest that was the former life of guess who? Edgar Cayce/David Wilcock. This was all in the Edgar Cayce material: they talked about Ra-Ta building the pyramids by levitation, doing all these miracles of healing – but, the Edgar Cayce material never talked about a group soul. The Carla Rueckert Ra material talked about a high priest – a priest in Egypt – that the Ra group had an affinity with, 10,000 B.C. They worked with that high priest, did miracles of healing, built the pyramids., but, they never said it was Edgar Cayce.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I discovered this early on, and I said, “I am onto something! I’m discovering something.” These are two references that it seemed like there was a high indication they were both talking about the same incident, but one didn’t talk about soul groups and the other didn’t talk about Edgar Cayce. But – the name was Ra-Ta.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Also, in the Edgar Cayce material, Ra-Ta became known historically as Ra, the Sun God. In the Carla Rueckert material, it said that the work we did – this is Ra group speaking – was picked up by the negative forces in the realm, the priesthood. Instead of using it to uplift people, it was used to control them, to use fear. When you have these secret sources in other dimensions and people think you have it and they don’t and they can’t access it and you’re keeping it to yourself, it’s very intimidating. So, for thousands of years, Egypt was under the auspices of the negative. Most of the gods of Egypt – if not all – were of the negative. They were beings in other realms or beings in spaceships that were trying to control everything. But, they still used the name Ra, because Ra started it with David Wilcock – David knows all of this – Ra started it 10,000 B.C.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">They used the word Ra, but they put a negative on it. They said ‘Amun-Ra’; Amun-Ra, that’s the negative name that those Egyptians used for Ra. That’s the name some of the secret societies use for Ra. That’s when I first started trying to figure this out; I was trying to figure it out because I said “Is Ra positive?” Sometimes Christians will go back and talk about Ra and they’re aware of the pagan Ra and the rituals in Egypt and say “Ra is negative.” This is how it actually happened: they re-named Ra and called Amun-Ra which is not the group soul. Guess what? – Amun-Ra – every religion prayer, what does it end with? Amen. Where do you think ‘Amen’ comes from? Amun. You see how this gets plugged in and becomes part of consensus? And, no one knows what’s happening.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I’m going to look here and read a couple of the things from the Ra material. This is available for free on Carla Rueckert’s website. We have her on many times as a guest. Perhaps next week we might even just continue this conversation. Of course, keep in mind even though she was the channel for the Ra material she was in a trance. She had to study it herself and figure it out. She may not be as much of an expert on it as someone else. In fact, she says her husband is more adept at it than she is.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Nonetheless, there were these four years of communication between Carla Rueckert and Don Elkins was the questioner and this voice that said it was the Ra group. Don Elkins had a little channeling group. In his channeling group they were talking to a lot of lower entities or even high lower entities. At one point, he asked a question that couldn’t be answered by the lower entities. Suddenly, a voice came in and this was January 15</span></span></span><span color="#000000"><sup><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">th</span></span></sup></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">, 1981, he asked a question. He said the answer was:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span color="#000000">“</span><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I am Ra. I have not spoken through this instrument before. We had to wait until she was precisely tuned as we send a narrow-band vibration. We greet you in the love and the light of our infinite creator. We have watched your group; we have been called to your group for you have a need for the diversity of experiences in channeling which go with a more intensive – or as you might called it advanced – approach to the system of studying the pattern of the illusions of your body, your mind and your spirit which you call seeking the truth. We hope to offer you a somewhat different slant upon the information which is always and ever the same.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">At this time, we would be glad to attempt to speak to any subject or question which those entities in this room may have potential use in the requesting.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">So the first question was:</span></span></p>
<p><span color="#000000">“</span><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Do you have a specific purpose? If so, could you tell us something of what your purpose is?”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span color="#000000">“</span><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I am Ra; we communicate now. We are those who are of the Law of One. In our vibration the polarities are harmonized, the complexities are simplified, the paradoxes have a solution. We are one. That is our nature and our purpose. We are old upon your planet, and have served with varying degrees of success in transmitting the Law of One, of unity, of singleness to your people. We have walked your planet; we have seen the faces of your people.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">However, we now feel the great responsibility of staying in the capacity of removing the distortions and powers that have been given to the Law of One. We will continue in this until – shall we say – your cycle is appropriately ended; if not this one, then the next.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We are not part of time, and thus we are able to be with you in any of your times.”</span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Now, what did they say? This cycle is the 75,000-year cycle that’s coming to an end. They said they will be with us on our next cycle – 75,000 years from now. They will be working just as they are now to help us understand – not just understand, but – energetically connect with their frequencies or the frequencies of the higher realms.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Then, the questioner said:</span></span></p>
<p><span color="#000000">“</span><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I’ve heard the name Ra in connection with Egyptians. Are you connected with that Ra in any way?”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span color="#000000">“</span><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I am Ra. Yes, the connection is congruency. May we elucidate? What do you not understand?”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>“<span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Could you give me a little more detail about your role with the Egyptians?”</span></span></p>
<p><span color="#000000">“</span><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I am Ra. The identity of the vibration Ra is our identity. We, as a group, are what you would call a social memory complex, made contact with a race of your planetary kind which you call Egyptians. Others from our density made contact at the same in South America and the so-called lost cities were their attempt to contribute to the Law of One.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We spoke to one who heard and understood and was in a position to decree the Law of One.”</span></span></p>
<p><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">They’re referring there now to that early life of Edgar Cayce/David Wilcock.</span></span></p>
<p><span color="#000000">“</span><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">However, the priests and peoples of that era quickly distorted our message, robbing it of the – shall we say – compassion with which unity is informed by its very nature. When we were no longer able to have appropriate channels through which to annunciate the Law of One we removed ourselves from the now hypocritical position which we had allowed ourselves to be placed in. Other myths – shall we say – having more to do with polarity and the things of your vibration that are complex again took over in that particular society complex.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">They go on and on about Egypt, and they go into a lot of detail about it. What is amazing in this little sci-fi movie that you are all participating in by being on these calls is that I started talking to the Elohim group for at least a year. At one point, I had asked a question. Suddenly, through Terry, the voice came through and said “I am Ra” and answered my question.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Now, I’m scratching my head because I’m reading about Ra and I’m talking to the Elohim. I’m saying “Is this real? Is this really Ra?” Every time something like that happened, I’d say “Is this a negative source coming in trying to side-track me?” I had to check it and check it out.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Four or five years later, we have this amazing event. Some of you were on the line when this happened; this amazing event where Terry said they had an announcement. They said, “The Ra group and the Elohim group” – because we have learned to feel the frequencies of both groups – “the Ra group and the Elohim group (had) made a liaison in other dimensions.” That the voice that would talk to us now was Ra’An, which was a combination of the Ra group and the Elohim group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">It took me a long time to believe that. When I say it, when I share the story – it’s so out there that even my own mind says, “Okay, what are we doing here? We have the source that created the physical universe talking to us. Now we have this major administrative source in the lower realms, the Ra group that has worked closely with us. Both group souls’ energies are available to us.” Some of you feel the energy shift just because I’m talking about it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We don’t have to have a channeling to have the energies shift. You can feel them coming in, coming around you, coming close and working with your energy fields. You’re actually working it; it’s all one, you see. You’re them, they’re us – it doesn’t feel like it’s not you; it’s nothing taking you over. It’s not scary; it feels very, very loving. It’s happening right now just because I’m talking about them.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Some of you are feeling it. That’s the miracle of what we’re doing that it seems to me. It was a long time before I could talk about this so openly as I’m doing right now. I wasn’t sure it was happening. I was feeling energies. It was only when I started getting emails from so many other people that they were getting it. Then, they start having little miracles happen and having all these cognitions and [they] were kind of raving about their experience that they were having. Just as I talk about them it starts to happen.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">If you have someone that you’re comfortable enough with – and if you’re even on Team Shift – you might start reading little excerpts from the Ra material or </span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce</i></span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> or </span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><i>Questions &amp; Answers with the Elohim</i></span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">. Read them with another person. You might note that if you’re feeling a shift now, you will feel that shift when you read those materials. You don’t need me; you don’t need Terry. It’s now out there, it’s in print. It’s on the internet.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">It’s one thing to read it by yourself; it’s quite another thing to read it with someone else. Terry and I discovered that when I was writing </span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><i>The Reincarnation of Edgar </i></span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Cayce and she was helping with all the editing. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">It’s 6:54; we’re supposed to stop in a couple of minutes. I start talking about this and I could go on and on – I barely scratched the surface – about the shift that’s happening and about how the Ra group describes it and how to prepare yourself for it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">The main thing is, don’t worry; send love to the universe. If you’re feeling the energies, keep coming to these calls because this is a way to keep tuning yourself up and kind of learning to carry the energy yourself without me, without the calls, through the middle of the week. Many of you are feeling that. I know its working.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Let’s take a moment, because I know there are a lot of people that keep coming and they need shifts in their life. As you hold this expanded space – this expanded map – you move through the veil; and, you start attracting things to you. Synchronicity is the way that the universe expresses itself in miracles for many people. Let’s bring the energy in from the top of our heads.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">In </span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce,</i></span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> the Ra group said – this is how our Sunday grid healing got started – I said, “I wonder if this will really work?” They said “Send the energy up through the top of your head to us and we’ll feel it and we’ll send it back to you as love-light vibrations.” As you feel that energy come back, just take it in, relish in it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">And, ask where you need help; ask the universe – just put it out there while you’re in an expanded space, put it out there. They are listening, remember: no manipulation, no agendas, no asking to win the lottery – unless it’s for the highest good. But [ask] for things to come to you in natural, flowing ways that you need in your life; and, for the healing to come to you if that’s one of your issues to move into your body and work on a cellular level transmuting.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Let’s take a moment and send this energy to Hurricane Sandy, to the dispersion of it for the highest good, for the safety of all the people that are in her path. Take a moment of silence on that one; let’s love Hurricane Sandy. That’s the way to get her attention; love her and let her go. Say, “Please let your wrath be replaced by loving energy.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Alright – it is now 6:58; thank you, Don [at BBS Radio] for letting us go a few more minutes. We’re going to say goodbye to everybody. Everyone is unmuted. I hope that was interesting – was that interesting? </span></span></span></span></span></p>
