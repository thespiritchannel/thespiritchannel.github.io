font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Transcribed by Connie O'Brien</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Hello everyone.&nbsp; This is Terry Brown, the co-host of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Wynn Free Monday night radio show.&nbsp; We welcome everybody on BBS</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Radio and on the conference line, as this is a simulcast between</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">BBS Radio and the conference line where people can call in and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they can ask questions.&nbsp; I want to introduce Wynn Free, the star</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of the show.&nbsp; Wynn – are you there?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Don’t call me the “star of the show” –gees!&nbsp; What</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">an insult.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong> Terry I love you!</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Others:</strong>&nbsp; I love you Terry.&nbsp; Way to go, Terry.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Michael:</strong> Subtlety is your middle name. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong> You know what?&nbsp; The fact of the matter is, Terry is the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">star of the show and I’m just the Master of Ceremonies.&nbsp; Well,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">she’s the 'star to the stars' – right?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Lisa:&nbsp;</strong> That’s right.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Is that right, Terry?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> huh?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Oh well - I’m putting her on the spot.&nbsp; Well, if you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">happen to be listening for the first time - this is, as Terry</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">said, a simulcast where things that are impossible happen.&nbsp; Lord</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">knows, we need impossible things right now on Planet Earth.&nbsp; Many</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of you who are listening to the call are watching our world go</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">through states of transformation, break down, tsunamis,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">terrorists.&nbsp; The interesting thing is, as the author of The</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce, I started writing about all of that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in the year 2000 when I was studying the channelings of David</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Wilcock. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">When I was writing that, I was saying, “Can this be true?” </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">It was not so obvious what would be happening on our planet at</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that time, and yet this group soul started saying it through</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Wilcock, through his channelings or transmissions or messages. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">And, here we are, and we’re in the middle of it.&nbsp; And, we’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in for what is called a “dimensional shift.” </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The most important thing here is, if all the stuff that I’ve</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">been exposed to is correct, that we need to stay in the center of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the storm.&nbsp; And, to stay in the center of the storm – it’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">not easy to do that by yourself.&nbsp; We need energies of each other</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to hold the space.&nbsp; When you’re just by yourself, you’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">fragile.&nbsp; Everything can pull you this way, that way.&nbsp; And, the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">center of the storm is a crucial place to be, but you move</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">slightly and you catch the winds and you get blown out of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">center.&nbsp; </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Really, the purpose of these calls and the work I’m doing is to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">help people stay in the center of the storm.&nbsp; It takes practice,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it takes discipline, it takes high intention and it takes friends</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in high places; we’re lucky enough to have that.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">takes each other.&nbsp; It takes loving connection with each other. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">There’s a lot of things going on around these calls that are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">helping people to do that and if you judge by the results, it’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">working.&nbsp; It’s working for the people who make it work for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">them.&nbsp; Nothing works unless you make it work.&nbsp; Making it work</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">means reaching back; it means putting an effort forward.&nbsp; Some of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you are finding the things you need to stay in the center of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">storm in other ways, or you use the information on these calls</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and then take it into the energies you’re working with and you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">can hold it.&nbsp; And, that’s wonderful.&nbsp; This is something that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">anyone can take it at their own level, and there are a lot of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">levels of connection if you choose, and there’s a lot of levels</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of information that can help you understand things and operate</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">better.&nbsp; But, it’s really important that you make the intention</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to stay at the center of the storm.&nbsp; A lot of times when people</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">get that idea “Oh, oh I’d better get in the center of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">storm” the first thing that comes up is fear. "What if I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">can’t get there?"&nbsp; Well, that’s just part of the path.&nbsp; You</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have to go through your fear; you have to keep taking one step in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">front of the other, and do what it takes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">One of the best programs we have, if you’re one of those people</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">who feel disconnected, is something called ‘Team Shift.’ </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Everything we do, I do, I look at it as experimental because I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">don’t know if it’s going to work until it works.&nbsp; We’ve</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">been running the Team Shift program for I guess about a year or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">longer, and it has room to support a lot more people.&nbsp; The way it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">works is: we have small groups of three to five to six people</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">meeting every day for ten minutes, and they call in the light. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Calling in the light is when we invoke the higher forces.&nbsp; So if</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you’re going to be in Team Shift you should at least be on our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">calls enough to say, “Hmm, maybe they’re really calling in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the higher forces.” </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">You know, the fact that we’re doing this is a semi-miracle,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">because Terry and I are both pretty… in some ways – how would</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I say it?&nbsp; Neither of us has had the easiest time functioning in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the physical realm for most of our lives.&nbsp; And here, we’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">doing something, we’re creating something and people are paying</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">attention.&nbsp; I don’t think of myself as different from you; I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">just have these amazing experiences that, doing these calls is my</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">way of taking responsibility for the experiences - when I knew</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they were real.&nbsp; And, it had to do with communications with</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">intelligences in other realms that could help us help each other,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">help the planet and the understanding of how the universe works. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Some of the stuff we present on these calls, I don’t believe</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">has ever been put out to a public audience; and, perhaps not even</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to a private audience because there are things that we’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">learning that you couldn’t figure out scientifically, you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">couldn’t figure out by studying history.&nbsp; It has to come from</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what I call interdimensional sources who are outside of time, and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have observed and connected with us through time over tens of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">thousands of years.&nbsp; Learning from their perspective what</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">evolution really is; what it means to evolve as a human. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">There are many ways that people have talked about evolution in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">spiritual terms.&nbsp; They talk about God-realization.&nbsp; They talk</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">about Enlightenment.&nbsp; They talk about being clear.&nbsp; You know</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there are many words, from a human perspective, that relate to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">advancement that most humans don’t have but might like to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">attain to if they knew it was possible.&nbsp; And, we’ve discovered</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a whole new way of looking at that particular phenomena which</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">otherwise is somewhat of a mystery; it has been for me.&nbsp; I mean,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I read about that when I was young and I said, “Oh boy, someday</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I might get God-realized and I’m just going to walk around and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">glow all the time.&nbsp; I’ll feel perfectly great all the time, and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I’ll know everything.”&nbsp; Maybe some of you have had that idea.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;So you go to this weekend seminar and sit at the seat of this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">guru or that guru.&nbsp; And somehow, even though there are some</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">really amazing experiences, you come back to yourself.&nbsp; And I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">used to say “Well when do I get to glow all the time?&nbsp; When do</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I get to God-realization?” </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Then I had this experience of communicating with this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">intelligence that said they were a group soul, and that they call</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">themselves the Elohim.&nbsp; Throughout history, or many times in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">history, the Elohim has been one of the names for God.&nbsp; When I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">asked them about it, they said, “Well, we don’t really like</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">being worshipped; we’d rather be your friend.&nbsp; We’re just in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">another dimension and we can impact your realm and when we do</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">impact things it’s very powerful on your level.&nbsp; People tend to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">give up their power when they see that kind of power</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">demonstrated.&nbsp; But, it’s not our desire to have you give up</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">your power; it’s…”&nbsp; They may correct me; whenever I talk</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">for them, I may not get it exactly right.&nbsp; “We can help humans</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to evolve.” </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">There are some rather important aspects of evolving, because we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">don’t see beginning points and end points.&nbsp; So we only see our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">little life and we’re born and we die and we see our friends</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and we read the newspaper – when I say beginning points and end</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">points, I mean the beginning point of where we started from. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Where did we come from?&nbsp; How did that start?&nbsp; What happened from</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">then until now?&nbsp; Why is reincarnation in existence?&nbsp; What happens</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">when you die?&nbsp; What are the different outcomes that can happen</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">when you die?&nbsp; Where do you go?&nbsp; Are there different places where</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you can go?&nbsp; We have explored all those things with a fine-tooth</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">comb and many of the things we’ve learned – because I’m</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">part of the learning here, I don’t know these things – fit</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">into history, fit into religion.&nbsp; But, from a point of view that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">doesn’t have to do with belief or faith.&nbsp; If we want to become</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">God-realized, and we’re talking to a source that we’ve</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">thought of as God, and they say, “We don’t want to be God; we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">want to be your friends.” it’s like:&nbsp; Where do we go from</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The goal is to have friends in high places, because in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">biggest sphere of the way of looking at things, the universe is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">one being, one energy – which our Sources call the ‘Law of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">One’.&nbsp; We all derive from the same energy; and, at one point,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we were undifferentiated and not separated.&nbsp; And then we became</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">separated and then we forgot, and then there’s the path</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">backwards to that energy which we go through all these many</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">lifetimes to go somewhere.&nbsp; Where are we going and how does that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">work? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The topic tonight was a continuation of DNA and its connection to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the cosmos.&nbsp; We discovered a lot of things in this ongoing</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">discussion about DNA; and it’s always extremely fascinating</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">because we’re going into a realm that humans can’t ever</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">figure out on their own.&nbsp; We have to see how the answers make</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sense in a real level.&nbsp; So, here are some of the things, as I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">recall, from our previous conversations in this relationship to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">DNA and soul evolution.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can correct me if I got something</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">wrong. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">DNA could be looked upon as a microcosm for the entire universe. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">DNA is the basic building-block of life: all life forms start</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">with DNA.&nbsp; When I say a ‘microcosm for the universe’ it would</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">be, if we were able to study DNA, we could also learn a lot about</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the universe which is the bigger part of it.&nbsp; So, microcosm and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">macrocosm, where something very small is the reflection of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">something very big.&nbsp; If that’s the case that means on some</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">level we have the potential for being the universe inside of us. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">How does this potential work?&nbsp; DNA has twelve strands and the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">strands are either open or closed.&nbsp; I am in no way a genetic</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">scientist, so I may get this wrong.&nbsp; I’ll do my best just</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">through my own understanding. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">When a strand of DNA opens, it opens you up to a certain aspect</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of the universe, or a certain aspect of yourself.&nbsp; And, the first</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">seven DNA strands approximately represent the first seven</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">chakras, and the next five represent expansions outside of your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">body.&nbsp; In fact they said the eighth one represents the place</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">above your head, about a foot.&nbsp; Everyone has different strands</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">activated at different levels, and what activates a strand of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">DNA?&nbsp; How does it get activated? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Well, you have a chakra system which represents areas of your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">body where there is energy centers that are open or closed to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">various degrees.&nbsp; Like, your heart chakra, your power chakra;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">your heart chakra would be your fourth chakra.&nbsp; Your fifth chakra</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">would be your throat chakra.&nbsp; Your sixth chakra would be what</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they call your “third eye”, and your seventh chakra is the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">crown chakra at the top of your head; and then there’s the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">pineal gland which has something to do with all of this.&nbsp; When a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">chakra is opened, it brings in a certain energy through that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">chakra which then impacts the strand of DNA associated with it. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">We all know the experience of occasionally feeling love.&nbsp; When we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">feel love: that’s the fourth chakra.&nbsp; When you feel that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">bursting of your heart; it doesn’t have to be bursting it can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">be much more neutral than that.&nbsp; But, for some people it comes</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">like that the first time it starts where you feel that radiance</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">– this is not an emotional feeling now, that’s a different</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">kind of love – it’s just a radiance around your chest.&nbsp; And</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">when you do that, it connects with other people and they feel it.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;And when they do that, it connects with you.&nbsp; We all know how it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">feels, hopefully we know, we’ve had the experience of being in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">an environment where there’s a loving energy and your heart</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">spontaneously opens.&nbsp; When your heart opens, it starts a thing</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that opens up your fourth chakra.&nbsp; Normally, the interesting</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">thing I’ve learned, this was a great piece of understanding, is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that: the fourth chakra – it’s not like it glows and stays</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">open.&nbsp; It’s like you need to create pathways in your life to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">keep that chakra open consistently, because it can only respond</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to the pathway.&nbsp; Therefore, you go and you have some kind of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">experience where it opens and then you do something else and it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">closes and then you do something else and it opens again.&nbsp; If you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">want to keep it open, you have to constantly have experiences of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a fourth chakra nature. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">One of the best ways to do that is to have a wonderful</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">relationship because now you have somebody that is always holding</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a space of fourth chakra loving energy to you, and your fourth</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">chakra stays open all the time to that degree.&nbsp; That doesn’t</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">mean all relationships are fourth chakra, because they’re not. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I’m talking about a good relationship; a good relationship will</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">hold that energy open.&nbsp; Oftentimes it’s up to you to inspire</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that energy in the person around you by listening to them, by</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">caring.&nbsp; When you start to truly care, other people start to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">truly respond. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The other chakras open by the use of the energy of that chakra. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">For example, the fifth chakra - which is the throat chakra – if</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I’m talking then I’m into my throat chakra.&nbsp; I talk a lot so</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I get a chance to keep the fifth chakra open.&nbsp; If I talk and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I’m loving, I have the fifth chakra and the fourth chakra open,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">so I’m leaving a fairly constant keeping of those DNA strands</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">open.&nbsp; But, as soon as I switch directions and as soon as I do</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">something which is of a lower level, or be around a lower level</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">type connection with someone else which I sometimes do, those</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">chakras close.&nbsp; It’s not like you just advance – it’s a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">constant flow to keep chakras open.&nbsp; So every moment is a chance</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to open chakras. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">You can also open your chakras, not only with other people, but</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">with the energies from other dimensions.&nbsp; As you learn to feel</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the energies of these groups souls – the Elohim group and the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Ra group – there is a kind of love that you can depend on that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">is bigger and sometimes more dependable than a personal</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">relationship, because personal relationships can come and go and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">people can change, and then when you’ve learned to open up your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">fourth chakra in a personal relationship and then that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">relationship falls apart, oftentimes people get devastated and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">hurt, and it can take them years to recover.&nbsp; So this bringing in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the on-going energy connection with these group souls, feeling a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sense of loving with them, is a way to keep your chakras open. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Everyone has different potentials and different growths depending</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">on their own, where they’re at.&nbsp; So when you decide you want to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">open your chakras, when you decide you want to evolve yourself,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you need to start moving your intention pointed towards higher</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">realms, towards higher connections.&nbsp; I personally think the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">easiest way to do it is by making the connection with these group</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">souls, because it’s not so easy to find things in the world</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that you can depend on.&nbsp; You can find groups you can go to that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">will lift your energies and it’s good to do that, but then you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have to go back again.&nbsp; You can, maybe if you’re lucky,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you’ll have a good friend and that friend and you will have a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">heart-felt connection and you call them up everyday, and everyday</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you call them up you move into that connection again and that’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">good. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">It’s not like an either/or situation; it’s not like; “Oh</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">God the Elohim love me.&nbsp; I don’t have to live my life!” </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">That’s not true.&nbsp; You’re in a body and you should be having,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">or you could be having – it’s a possibility – that you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">could be having fun down here, and having great friends and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">having great experiences.&nbsp; But, oftentimes it’s not so easy to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have that in this realm and people get very blocked. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">So these are all little looks at what it takes to keep our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">chakras open, and to keep our DNA activated.&nbsp; You know, they tell</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">me they’re on the calls and they’re paying attention to you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">during this call even while I’m talking about this.&nbsp; So there</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">is a double-communication:&nbsp; there’s the communication of what</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I’m saying, and there’s the communication of other</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">dimensions.&nbsp; Take a moment – let’s just be silent and be open</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to being loved interdimensionally.&nbsp; Be open to feeling the flow</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of love through your energetic system without anyone present to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">love you.&nbsp; Let’s feel that…&nbsp; (silence)</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Now if you walked into a room; some of you felt it, some of you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">felt a certain kind of reverence.&nbsp; You can see how religions and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">churches got started, because if someone was around that was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">helping people tune into that connection, and then people were</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">all in a room and said, “Let’s tune into that connection”,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it’s very silent.&nbsp; It’s very reverent.&nbsp; And, it’s opening</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">up everyone’s DNA. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Ultimately, you have to be active to keep this all open.&nbsp; You</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">can’t just be passive.&nbsp; It takes some active promotion on your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">part.&nbsp; Otherwise it just dies.&nbsp; You can come into these calls and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">feel the energy, but ultimately you have to create, in this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">realm, your own manifestation.&nbsp; That is path to mastery here, to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">be able to manifest, to hold this energy open and help other</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">people hold it open.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter how you do that.&nbsp; You</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">can be sitting as a receptionist in a legal office, like Terry</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">did, and hold the space and other people just feel it.&nbsp; You just</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">change the energy.&nbsp; Then when you do that, you’re changing the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">energy for yourself. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">You could go into the same office and it could be a nightmare; it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">could be a bunch of attorneys fighting with each other.&nbsp; So</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it’s learning that – what was that famous movie: “If you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">come, they will follow”?&nbsp; I’ve had to learn that.&nbsp; I said,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">“I’m coming to these calls every week, three times a week. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">How do I know they’re going to be there?&nbsp; I don’t want to do</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">this myself; I can’t do it myself.”&nbsp; I had to keep coming,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and every time I would they’d be here.&nbsp; It wasn’t even</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">required that I was in a good mood; sometimes I wasn’t in a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">good mood, but I still came and they showed up.&nbsp; Sometimes I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">didn’t want to do it, and I still came and they showed up. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">That’s an amazing thing to learn.&nbsp; Why don’t you try, every</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">day, to take a moment of meditation?&nbsp; Or, listen to the opening</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of our Sunday grid healing where I do that meditation and shut</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">your eyes and do it at the same time and say, “If I show up,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">will they come?”&nbsp; And see if they do.&nbsp; They will!&nbsp; They will! </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">This is how you do it – don’t just say, “Where are you? </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Where are you?” - make a space, and let them know you’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">going to be there everyday so that they can ‘adjust their own</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">schedules’, so to speak. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">We have this program called ‘Team Shift’ which works for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">people; it’s been working really well for people, where a small</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">group of people meet every day at the same time.&nbsp; They’ve</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">learned that when they show up the energies show up.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">doesn’t matter how you feel beforehand.&nbsp; It’s like it’s an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">evolving process; as you learn and train yourself to tune into</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">these energies, you just start to do it - everywhere.&nbsp; It sounds</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">simple, but it’s not so simple because every individual has</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">patterns, resistance, disbelief, all kinds of things that would</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">make one say, “This is not possible.” </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I suggest that if you do any of these things you do it as your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">own experiment. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Oh, oh – my phone is going to go dead and that’s going to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">close our connection with BBS Radio.&nbsp; Just a moment let me see</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">– oh, wait it’s charging again, maybe we can save this, okay?</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;I have ordered batteries for my phone; I ordered them the second</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">time, and hopefully they’ll be here tomorrow.&nbsp; I didn’t get</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">them the first time.&nbsp; My battery has gotten weak.&nbsp; It’s really</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">embarrassing that I keep having this problem when we do these</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">calls.&nbsp; I think I’ll take the phone and plug it into another</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">computer.&nbsp; We operate, in case you guys don’t know it, on a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">pretty small budget.&nbsp; Some of you have been sending us donations</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and that is very much appreciated.&nbsp; Keeping on a small budget</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">allows us to be totally – how would I say it? – no one</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">controls what we do here.&nbsp; For this kind of work, it’s very</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">important that no one controls it, because then it loses its</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">authenticity.&nbsp; So I don’t report to anybody.&nbsp; When my cell</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">phone battery goes dead, and you say “Why didn’t you do</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">this?” and “Why don’t you do that?”&nbsp; This is not yet at</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the place of a high degree of professionalism and you’ll have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to excuse us, but I will say we do the best that we can.&nbsp; So far,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we’ve been doing – it’s actually fairly impossible and very</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">rare that somebody is doing this in this realm, so they say.&nbsp; So</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I thank all of you who have been supporting it.&nbsp; Occasionally</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you’ll see a donation button; if you see it - $3, $4, $5.&nbsp; And</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">if you’re well-to-do we appreciate thousands of dollars, but</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that’s never happened yet.&nbsp; It also makes us feel that what</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we’re doing it working; received.&nbsp; Because, otherwise what do I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">need to do this for?&nbsp; We’re certainly not getting rich on it,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">but we are changing people’s lives.&nbsp; I know that – I get</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">emails all the time from people who have synchronicities, who</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have had healings, and there’s no other explanation for it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">except that it’s real and it’s working.&nbsp; On that note – let</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">me see if my battery is charging because I don’t want to go. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Okay, we’re charging.&nbsp; I think we’ll probably run a little</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">long tonight because I don’t’ think they have another show</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">after us.&nbsp; My battery is charging.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> I wanted to remind you that I’m not on BBS Radio.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; You’re on BBS Radio through the conference line, okay?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Okay.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; In other words, as long as you’re on … everyone’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">muted and you’re unmuted.&nbsp; So, you’re a moderator.&nbsp; So</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you’re on BBS Radio by nature of being on the conference line</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">as long as I’m still on BBS Radio, okay?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; If your phone goes dead, you’re not - right?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn</strong>:&nbsp; Yeah, that’s why I wanted to make sure it’s charged</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">because otherwise I could have called in on the Skype line; but,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it’s charging it looks like I’m okay.&nbsp; What it is the battery</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">has gotten so low, so weak, that it goes for about forty minutes</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">instead of a few hours.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong> Wynn, do you have a back up plan in case it fails?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Well, the backup plan – it’s not going to fail, it’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">charging.&nbsp; I can see it.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Gjis:&nbsp;</strong> Okay.&nbsp; Yeah.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; It’s not going to fail.&nbsp; If it failed, what would we do?</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;I’d go on Skype and I’d call BBS directly, but it would</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">screw up everything.&nbsp; So we’re not going to fail; we’ll be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">okay. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I’m talking a lot now and I didn’t mean to talk so much but</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we can go a little longer.&nbsp; I’m just like the opening act here,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and we’re going to bring our guys in through Terry, and we will</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">get some of the refinements of how all this DNA/chakra/evolution</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">works, because on one hand we’re gaining knowledge.&nbsp; On the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">other hand, we’re getting critical information about how to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">keep ourselves open, because our planet is in a great</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">transformation right now. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Some of you have noticed there are people running around in fear,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">their fear of what’s going to happen?&nbsp; It’s silly to be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">afraid of dying, because if you’re going to be afraid of dying,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">then you may as well be afraid every moment of your life because</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you’re going to die!&nbsp; I’d be afraid of not knowing what</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">happens when you die, not knowing the rules of the game.&nbsp; We’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">learning the rules of the game; we know historically there are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">many civilizations that have fallen; that Atlantis went into the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ocean; that Mu went into the ocean; that there was a planet</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">called Maldek that exploded into asteroids.&nbsp; We know that Hitler</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">killed millions of Jews.&nbsp; There are horrible things that happen</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in the Universe, and one of the things we’re learning is how to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">navigate in this realm and be as successful in this realm as we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">can. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The other thing we’re learning is that there are other realms</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and to make sure that when we leave this realm that we have the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">best transition possible.&nbsp; And, that’s possibly more important</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">than navigating this realm.&nbsp; As the Elohim would say - and you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">know, after talking to them for this period of time - I start –</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and those of you that are on the line often start – to get this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">perspective:&nbsp; you know, well this is just one lifetime in many</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and this is one planet in many, and this is one opportunity in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">many and everyone is eternal and we go on and on.&nbsp; Once you can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">really integrate that, it gets rid of a lot of fear.&nbsp; When your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">time comes, your time comes.&nbsp; But the key is, we do go on and on,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">but there are different future potentials, and how do we create</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the best future potentials for ourselves?&nbsp; I think it’s in this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">area that faith comes into play, because we’re not there, we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">can’t prove this to ourselves.&nbsp; Although the fact that we’ve</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">been doing this for so long, the fact that there have been so</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">many synchronicities and miracles, and information – it really</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">is hard to explain how it’s all occurring if it’s not real. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I was talking about ‘Team Shift’: for those of you that feel</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that you would like an on-going support system to help you keep</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">your energies open, then go to www.teamshift.messageaday.net and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">fill out, do all the paperwork.&nbsp; I’m supposed to charge for it,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">but I don’t charge for it.&nbsp; Some day I might surprise you and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">charge, but the key to this is:&nbsp; I want to make the indelible</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">point that we’re not doing this as a business.&nbsp; Although on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">some level it has to ground as a business to expand, to reach</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">more people and to support ourselves, the intent is way higher</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">than just to see how many people we can get sending us money for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">any particular thing.&nbsp; www.teamshift.messageaday.net&nbsp; The people</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">who come in every day and say ‘hello’ to each other on the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">phone and call in the light are having phenomenal experiences. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">One Monday we’ll bring some of them on the line to share</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what’s happened to them as a result. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">One of the things is: don’t feel like you have to be together</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to do this!&nbsp; Nobody’s together, we need each other.&nbsp; This is a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">way – just try it.&nbsp; If it doesn’t work, quit it.&nbsp; If</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">everyone’s nasty to you, quit it.&nbsp; Don’t worry about – one</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of the things about feeling bad about yourself is it’s hard to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">take action, and you think people are going to judge you.&nbsp; Try it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">out.&nbsp; This group is really well-conditioned to not make</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">judgments, the people that have been around for a while.&nbsp; It’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">an opportunity for you maybe – maybe that one phone call to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Team Shift and participating can shift your path and help you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">keep your heart open.&nbsp; Now we’ll call in the light.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the light to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">surround and protect each person here and any negativity be taken</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to the higher realms of light and transmuted for the highest good</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of all concerned.&nbsp; We see ourselves in the flow of energy</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">radiating from the center of the universe, through the galaxies,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">through our bodies, into the center of the earth.&nbsp; (I did that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">fast.)&nbsp; Right now we invoke a group energy and we invite those</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sources that are positive, service-to-others - to join with our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">energies and we create a protected space that only the positive</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">has access to and anything not of that nature must leave now.&nbsp; Do</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we have our sources present? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes, this is Ra’An, and we greet you in the love</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">light of the One Infinite Creator.&nbsp; This is May 16th, 2011 and we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">reach out and we are available to each and every person that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">hears this call, to each and every person that hears the audio,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to each and every person that reads the transcript.&nbsp; And, we are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">available to answer your questions. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">You are looking into the greater universe and connections with</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the Universe when you bring up the connection of the chakras and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the electrical systems and connections of the body and how it is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">connected and located within the earth sphere, within the plane</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of the earth which is of a lower frequency than the higher</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">realms.&nbsp; Do you have questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I did a kind of synopsis of my understanding of how things</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">work based on many of our conversations; did I have that fairly</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">well correct?&nbsp; Did I make any errors in the way I described that?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> You have it fairly well-developed, and we check back</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">over your talk.&nbsp; Give us a moment.&nbsp; Your talk was fairly accurate</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in the way the chakras connect and the DNA connects and the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">opening of the chakra systems and the closing of the chakra</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">systems. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">We have a couple of comments.&nbsp; One of them is that in the third</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">dimension the relationship between the chakra system and the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">surroundings is geared to respond.&nbsp; The chakra system is geared</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to respond, as conditions warrant, and you are totally right (in)</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that the opening of the chakra is more available to the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">individual when they are connected with a loving environment;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">however, as a creature who is living in the third dimension, it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">is also through experience, through the animal nature of the body</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">set to close when conditions become difficult as a protection for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the emotions and the survival of the delicate connections within</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the human body.&nbsp; Give us a moment. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Therefore, the opening and closing is in alignment with</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">conditions in the surroundings, so you are entirely correct that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">one will have a more open chakra when they are in a condition</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that allows them safely to expand and communicate and relate with</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">another.&nbsp; The relation of the DNA is that the DNA is responding</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to high frequencies at a condition where the higher vibrations of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">other external bodies, star systems, other planets have an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">influence upon the DNA and help form and hold into place the DNA.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; In order to receive the influences of those other star</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">systems, then the requisite chakras would have to be open, yes,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">for those influences to in stream?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> The chakras don’t have to be open or closed for the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">DNA to respond to the other star systems to solar bodies as it is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">affecting the body at all times, and the energies are strumming</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the DNA as though it were a string on a guitar.&nbsp; So, the body is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">under the influence these systems, whether or not the chakra is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">open; however, there is an influence of the DNA on … there is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">an influence caused in the DNA by whether the chakras are open or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">not.&nbsp; Also, as when the chakras are open it allows for a greater</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in streaming of the energies from the star systems, from the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">other planets; and the individual then can become more psychic</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and perceptive and intelligent when his systems, his chakra</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">systems, are open and he is more in alignment then with the star</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">systems and can take in greater information and greater energy.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> When we talk about the star systems, how far does the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">influence go?&nbsp; Is it the closer star systems or is it the star</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">systems in the entire universe that are impacting the DNA?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; The star systems mainly in the solar system and then in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">your galaxy, although there is influence by other star systems. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Any star system that moves light into your sphere.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> So, what we’re talking about here is the basis for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">astrology, yes?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; This is what astrology is based upon, and as the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">individual is born it is set into the individual’s body and the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">individuals are ‘dancing with the stars’ so to say, in that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they tend to ride in on a zodiac sign and – the channel does</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">not understand what she’s saying now – the zodiac sign, so</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that they may receive a familiar alignment.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> At an earlier time in my life I did astrology charts and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it was one of the first things that opened me up to a greater</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">look at the universe, because I was skeptical at first.&nbsp; One of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the things that was very compelling to me was - in my skepticism</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sometimes I would meet somebody of a certain astrological</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">configuration, and immediately it reminded me of someone else who</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">had the same configuration, and I would guess their sign.&nbsp; And I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">started to realize that they were moving energies in me, the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">other person based on the astrology would move energies inside me</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that I could feel, and I started to identify the energies that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">were moving in me and then guess their sign correctly. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">That was an amazing experience because I could feel the energies,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">even when I was skeptical.&nbsp; So in trying to understand that in my</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">logical mind it was like each of us carries the imprint of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">star systems in the way they were at the time we were born. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">It’s almost – let’s see, what’s the word? – like an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">imprint in your system.&nbsp; I guess that would be in your DNA, and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that other people carry the imprint of their systems with them,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and when people come together those imprints immediately start</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">interacting and we respond in very unique ways depending upon the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">person who is in our physical sphere at that time.&nbsp; Is that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">correct?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; Yes, it provides a grounding for each individual</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and they feel - although this is at a subconscious level - their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">DNA is oriented to that particular configuration and they are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">operable within that framework and use it as an anchor, a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">grounding and a reference point.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> We know there are twelve strands of DNA.&nbsp; What is the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">difference in the way astrological configurations affect DNA and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">just opening to the environment affects DNA?&nbsp; For example, do the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">astrological configurations affect all twelve strands, or does it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">affect the higher strands, or the lower strands?&nbsp; Obviously there</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">are only twelve variations, but I think there are sub variations</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in that which I don’t quite understand.&nbsp; How does that work?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> The astrological configuration interacts with the DNA</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and aligns the DNA in accordance with the path and pattern of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">energies in streaming from the star systems.&nbsp; The … give us a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">moment.&nbsp; The DNA responds to the energies in streaming from the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">star systems and resonates.&nbsp; The resonant nature is greater in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the strands of DNA that are used in connection with the chakra</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">system that is known and to a lesser degree, the other strands</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">are resonated by the higher energies and frequencies.&nbsp; As the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">individual expands their connection with all that is, more of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">strands can vibrate more strongly and bring the individual to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">realizations and perceptions they would not have otherwise had.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I also have this idea that there is a very unique way that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the planet earth imprints DNA, or connection.&nbsp; Like, if you took</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a human to another planet, how… when we had people walking on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the moon if that was actually true, when that happens, what’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the impact of the shift of the human body from the earth place to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">another place?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; There is a very great influence upon the body as when</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">an individual does not have the strong interaction that is in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">connection with the earth plane, then there is a different, a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">whole different, pattern of the integrity of the muscles and the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">cells of the body, as the influence can be lessened - depending</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">upon if the individual’s in space or if the individual’s on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the moon – and with the lessened impact of the earth and its</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">attractions does not then exercise the muscles.&nbsp; Individuals as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they exist in their daily life, just by virtue of the fact of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">being on the earth’s surface, get exercise in the resistance</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">their muscles feel to standing, to holding erect, and this helps</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">shape and form the muscles and keep them in their confirmation.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Is DNA a template for all life forms in the entire</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">universe?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes, the DNA is a template that is throughout the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">universe.&nbsp; It is formed from the resultant spinning energies of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the body, the celestial body, wherein the individual is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">developed, the body systems are developed, and live.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So DNA is the template, so that means all alien life</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">forms:&nbsp; grays, Orions – all have DNA-based systems.&nbsp; If</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">somebody is from a certain planet and they move to another</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">planet, can they do that successfully and stay there?&nbsp; Does their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">DNA re-adjust to the new planet, or do they have a limited time</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to be there before things start breaking down, for example.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> It depends upon what body they inhabit.&nbsp; Some bodies,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">over time, lose their template.&nbsp; And, as they lose their original</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">template and move away from it based upon what it takes to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">survive in that plane, they may run into difficulty with</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">surviving even on that plane or on another planet; however, an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">individual can, if they are flexible, adapt and can move into</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">life on another planet.&nbsp; The gravity may be stronger; the DNA may</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">develop a slightly different characteristic to adapt to the new</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">location.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; So, I think the bottom-line question really</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">is:&nbsp; How do you make this useful as a human?&nbsp; How do we adapt</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">this information about DNA and all the influences so that we can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have the best experience. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Oh!&nbsp; Let me ask this question:&nbsp; I put out the idea that a human,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">by opening up to the energies of feeling loved by the group souls</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">could open their DNA.&nbsp; Is it possible for a human to open up to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">such a degree that they become more detached from the need for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">human experience to do that, or is there always the need for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">human experience?&nbsp; We could take a look at Mother Theresa, who</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">was very dedicated to service.&nbsp; But, she still human experience</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">because she was in service all the time to humans.&nbsp; How about</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">some expansion and understanding of that particular concept?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> When an individual leaves this realm, they may take the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">memory of the DNA at a more thinner level, at a more ethereal</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">level, and may then use it to help form their heavenly body,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">which is similar to the human body.&nbsp; And, they can move into the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">different realm and have different characteristics than other</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">individuals that are in that realm. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So the DNA is still activated when you die?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; That is correct – the memory of the DNA moves with</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the individual and they manifest in the other realms based upon</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the memory of the form and substance of their DNA experience.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; We notice that many people look like their past lives, but</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">some people look like their mother or their father.&nbsp; Some people</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">– of course most people don’t know about their past lives. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">How is the appearance regulated with all the different variations</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of DNA?&nbsp; For example, astrologically it says when people have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">certain astrological configurations, their faces are fatter,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">their bodies are taller and thinner – so is there a way to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">understand how that mish-mash works that turns into a physical</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">experience?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Everything is in the now; everything is created over</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and over again in time.&nbsp; It is created in the now and all of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">factors of the past experience move into the creation.&nbsp; When an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">individual is born they may look more like their parents, but as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they move with the body over time, they may bring the past</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">memories of the DNA into their body and the body may, as they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">grow older, look more and more like they did in their past life.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I see.&nbsp; So, every life that a person has would be like</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that if they happened to be a resonance of a certain particular</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">past life in that life.&nbsp; If they’re duplicating patterns of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that life, they would start to look like that person.&nbsp; If they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">started to duplicate the patterns of another past lifetime, they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">might start to look like that person.&nbsp; Yes?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; That is correct.&nbsp; Generally there are similarities in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the lifetimes between how the individual looks, with the body</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">form, the facial features and the height and the weight of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">individual, as in the past they have gotten comfortable with that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">form and move it into their present form.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I see, thank you.&nbsp; So the final question is if you’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">going to recapitulate:&nbsp; if a human is going to take advantage of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">this knowledge, and they want to be at the highest level of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">evolution possible and they want to activate their DNA – it’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">probably a complex answer and it’s going to be different from</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">person to person to person.&nbsp; But, if you want to tackle</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">approaching that I’m sure people would appreciate understanding</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what they can do to keep their level of evolutionary advancement</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">at the highest state.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; They can keep their heart open and be flexible, as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">flexibility in attitude and tone allow them to move with the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">changes and to upgrade their DNA, as the energies in streaming</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">into the planetary system can strum, so to speak, their DNA and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">open it up to the higher energies and can open it up as it does</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that to inner communication with others and make the availability</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of remote vision available, of telepathy available; as if one</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">remains in a closed-off condition, they shut out possibilities</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">for higher connection with their surroundings and with others.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I remember a teacher I had many years ago, he said the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">first law of spirit was acceptance.&nbsp; It seems to me acceptance is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">another word for flexibility; in other words, if you’re in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">middle of an experience it doesn’t mean you don’t have to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">choose another experience, but particularly if it’s an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">uncomfortable experience, to allow yourself to flow through that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to be flexible to walk around it – sometimes I tell people like</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">water flows around rock – if you have a difficult relationship,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">learn how to flow with it, to accept it but not let it trap you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and that’s a very fast way through things.&nbsp; When you reject an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">experience you’re in the middle of, it seems like you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">perpetuate it and it doesn’t change.&nbsp; It’s kind of a trick,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">because people say, “I don’t want to accept this because</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it’s painful” but if they are always in a state of resistance</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it seems like they keep that circumstance alive through their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">resistance.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; That is correct.&nbsp; It is like a more ethereal</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">manifestation of an item.&nbsp; A rock in the middle of the road is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">very solid.&nbsp; Something that one does not want to accept is also</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">similar to a rock in the middle of the road, a hindrance to the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">passage of the individual through the difficult time as if they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">don’t accept it, then it remains there as an obstacle to them. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">However, acceptance does not mean liking it, or going along with</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it, even.&nbsp; Or, siding with it – it does not mean that.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">means simply acknowledging that it is there, the obstacle is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there, the thing one doesn’t like is there.&nbsp; By acknowledging</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it, that it is there, one does not have to like it or take it on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to be their own.&nbsp; They can simply acknowledge it and as such,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they give up the obstacle and can move around it and can let it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">go and can then re-adjust their life without it, without the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">obstacle.&nbsp; Does that make sense?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And I imagine that would hold true for any obstacle,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">like:&nbsp; I don’t have a job, I have a difficult relationship, my</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">family doesn’t love me, I’m sick, I have this problem in my</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">body.&nbsp; Anything like that - if you can accept it you give</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">yourself the power to move through it.&nbsp; But if you’re in a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">constant state of resistance to it, you let it perpetuate more.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes, when one rejects it, it remains there as a fact, a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">fact of life.&nbsp; However, if one can take it apart, analyze it, see</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what it is, what it consists of, then often the obstacle can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">simply dissolve and they can move past the obstacle.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Even on a cosmic level or on a planetary level, even on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the things that we look at that are negative in this realm –</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">negative groups, negative agendas – there is a similar process</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of flowing around them and not resisting them, whereas resisting</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">them would give them actually more power.&nbsp; Yes?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> That is correct - when one resists something that is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what they generally get.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> There is a saying which goes “that which you resist,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">persists”.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; That is very true.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Okay.&nbsp; We’ve been going for a long time and I thank you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">for being with us tonight and hanging in on this really</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">interesting subject.&nbsp; I hope our audience liked it and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">appreciated it and got something out of it.&nbsp; Do you have any</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">closing words before we say goodbye?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We send love to each and every person on the line.&nbsp; You</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have undertaken a difficult job - to manifest your lives in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">third dimension.&nbsp; And, it is a playing-ground for much</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">opportunity for learning and strengthening your soul.&nbsp; Adonai.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you everyone who is on the line and listening, and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we’ll see you next time.&nbsp; This is Wynn free with Terry Brown</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">bringing forth that information and our sources, our conglomerate</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">energy.&nbsp; They identify themselves as part of the Ra group and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">part of the Elohim group, and they are two group souls that have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;

We are honored to be able to bring</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">their voice to all of you who are listening. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;
