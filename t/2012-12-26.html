This is December 26, 2012, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">7:09 p.m.</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> Now it’s official; it’s being recorded.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">6:09</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> Pacific.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">6:09</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> Pacific. You know, when you’re recording, it’s bad enough talking to people, because they remember everything you say and if you look like an idiot nobody forgets it. Once you start the recorder, not only do people not forget it, they have to listen to it again and again.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Do you know what I’m saying, Gijs?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes; I’d like to silently start the recorder, but it will announce itself.</span></p>

Is there anything you want to say, Gijs, that you want to record for posterity that’s really dumb-sounding?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I can only speak from my heart and it is that I love every one of you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There we go; thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We say this over and over again, but it’s good to remind you:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When we’re channeling or doing transmissions or bringing in voices from other dimensions, we never ever tell you that you should believe it. You should not believe they are who they say they are and you should not believe what they say. The only thing that matters is what you can apply to your life and make a difference.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">One of the things that’s been the fall of mankind is taking things and turning them into doctrines, then saying, “This is what to believe”, or “The Elohim said this”, or “Wynn said that.” We are not presenting this in that way.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There are times and I say it outright, that sometimes there’s bleed-through from Terry’s conscious mind. Sometimes there’s bleed-through from Daphne’s conscious mind. For example, when Terry is giving counsel oftentimes she’ll come up with health stuff. When Sources are giving counsel through Daphne, often they’ll come up with something like, “Hug a tree” or “Take a walk.” Terry never takes walks, so it never comes up.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We can all observe this process, because in-between things like that there is incredible, incredible wisdom that shows up. So many people have had life-changing experiences. I point that out; I point it out before you do, because we’re not trying to make anything of perfection here. Daphne, are you on the line now?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am on the line, yes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>If you look at the history here, Daphne started channeling the Elohim at the very beginning; then Terry started channeling the voice that said they were the Elohim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At some point a few years ago, there was this major announcement that the Elohim said that they were working with the Ra group and that the two groups were acting as a team. The voice that came in said it was Ra’An and that we had the best of both coming through.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In the past few times Daphne has been on, you might recall that when she started to do a session we heard this very guttural, deep chant that was going “Raaaaaaaaaa” and the voice that came through said it was Ra. Carla Rueckert never had a guttural chant like that when she brought Ra through. We might ask a question about that tonight.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne, do you want to make any comments about that? Would you like to answer some questions tonight?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sure, sure, that would be fine.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Do you want to answer any questions about that Ra chant that has been coming through?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne </span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Yes, they’ve actually given me a little bit of information about that, as Wynn asked me about half an hour ago about the toning.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The toning is very, very similar in effect to what, for example, the Tibetan Buddhist monks do. The toning is a calibration of frequency. If any of you are musicians, when you go to a concert, the New York Philharmonic, or San Francisco Symphony, when you sit in Davies Symphony Hall, the oboe gives an ‘A’; that’s 440 cycles per second and the entire orchestra has to tune to the ‘A’. It’s a way of calibrating and harmonizing a certain frequency.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The Schumann Resonance of the earth now, is above 13 Hz; back in, I guess it was in 1987 at the Harmonic Convergence; it was somewhere around 7.8…</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Are you sure that’s true? Or, is that just what people say?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. I mean, I’ve read it all over the place. I’m just giving; please, check out everything I’m saying. Go and look on Google. But the Schumann Resonance is S-c-h-u-m-a-n-n Resonance of the earth. It’s widely-believed, even by main-stream geophysicists, to be around—actually it’s over, 13 cycles per second at this point. So it’s ascending.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It seems that there has to be a new anchoring; a new anchoring of the life-encoded frequencies. They’re giving me information about a new root chakra; the new root chakra can no longer be anchored in the old ways. The old ways were based on fear; they were based on divisiveness; they were based on control patterns. We are leaving that; we have left, actually, the old Gaia…</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Daphne, Daphne – excuse me. I just wanted the answer to that one question.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Okay, alright; I’m running away here. Anyway; that’s the kind of stuff that’s coming in.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m just going to tell everybody: Daphne reads everything. In my opinion, sometimes she’ll read things and quote them as if they’re true, or she believes them, but she hasn’t necessarily validated them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne, when you say these things—because you channel; I’m not supposed to say ‘channel’ I’m supposed to say ‘transmission’—when you bring messages in, there’s so much authority that people tend to believe everything you say from your conscious mind<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I just wanted to say:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It may be true; it may be that the Schumann Resonance is going up. It may be that the new paradigm is the heart and there’s no root chakra – although, I don’t know how people are going to reproduce.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No, no; it’s not a matter of <i>no</i> root chakra. The new root chakra is considered to be the heart chakra.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t want to have a discussion about this, because the question is: Where is the second chakra? Where is the first chakra? You know? I mean, where do you reproduce? It brings up a whole bunch of questions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I don’t like to take anything for granted. So that may be true, but until I can figure it out or until you can explain it to me so I understand it without just quoting somebody, I have to see ten different people coming up with it; until then, I don’t want to say it as if it’s true. Is that okay? Do you understand what I mean?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s fine.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Okay, good.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I consider myself a conduit; I’m a messenger. I’ve always, read from extremely diverse sources. I’m constantly pulling in and assimilating information. I present it for people’s edification. I would ask everyone to check it out; I present it so people have the option of exploring it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Okay. I try to vocabularize myself.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">So, even if a voice is talking to us, I say, “It’s the voice that identifies itself as the Elohim,” or something like that; I don’t say they are. Although I think they are; I think in many cases they are. It doesn’t serve you, the listener, to believe they are until something clicks inside you that says, “I can feel the energy. That puts pieces of the puzzle together.” Up to that point, it serves no purpose to believe that they created the Universe or anything like that. With anything I read I’m very careful about quoting anything. I can say things that I can know happened; there have been a bunch of events.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Terry was the spitting image of Saint Catherine; they told me to look up Saint Catherine. That happened, okay? That’s fact; it’s documented. Then when people speculate on things—there’s this and that and the other thing—I don’t know if it’s true or not. This is my process; I suggest that it can be your process, too. It’s a good process, because if you catch yourself, you find yourself not believing things that you can’t validate.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">One thing that you can validate is that there is most certainly a lot of wisdom that comes through on this line. If something is truly wise and if you can then apply it to your life and if you can change your life, you know that it works. Maybe you didn’t know it when you tried it, but you tried it and it worked. I know many, many, many people have been listening to these calls and used things on these calls and something shifted for them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Truthfully, that is the greatest benefit. It’s not about knowing what the Schumann Resonance is, or sophisticated knowledge. It’s about putting things into your life that you can apply that help you share loving energy with other people better, that help you not to be afraid, that help you attract synchronicities to you and opportunities; these are the things that are most important. Do you know why?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Because, you are most important; every one of you is so incredibly important. If you’re coming into these calls, I want to make sure that we deliver what is going to help you graduate this realm; that’s what they’re telling us. I can’t even prove that there’s going to be a graduation of this realm. That’s one of those things that you can take on faith. It started out with Jesus; then, it came through Carla Rueckert, came through David Wilcock, came through Daphne and came through Terry and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>a number of other people who are channels, all saying the same thing.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We are really honored to have Daphne with us tonight; I think she’s starting to like what we do. She might be coming back more often; I hope so. Can I talk about you Daphne; is it okay?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t know if I have a choice, but okay.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can stop me anytime; say, “Don’t tell them that!” okay? And, I’ll stop.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I’m so glad that Terry and Daphne go along with the quality of transparency that we bring forth on these shows; that each of us is willing to be transparent. Do you know what transparency means? It means we don’t have anything to prove; we all just humans, we’re all going through our human process. Daphne goes through hers, I go through mine, Terry goes through hers and in sharing that transparency with you, you realize that we’re one of you. We’re not standing on some exalted hill saying, “Here’s the truth.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">One of the things for Daphne is, she came from a long background of mystical Catholicism and reading the Bible and wondering if what we were doing was one of the things that Jesus warned people about that were misleading people.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">What if we’re misleading people? What if this is the devil working through us and it’s not the Christed Source? Then she would have terrible negative attacks that totally disabled her. She was thinking, “If what Wynn is doing is good, why am I having these attacks?” She would withdraw, but she didn’t stay withdrawn. She kept coming back.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It was like she was running down the street, screaming, “Let me out of here; I don’t want to do this! What am I doing? I want to play music.” She’s gone through about a ten year process and she’s still here.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There’s free will here, but in her individual mind it feels like she really sees the value of this work. Do you want to say anything about that, Daphne? Thanks for letting me just talk; you didn’t stop me, so I guess it was okay; anything you’d like to say?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s kind of you Wynn; thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Far be it from me to have the last word. I’m sorry, go ahead.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s fine; I mean, I think that it’s fairly accurate. It has been a really intense process of integration and having to work with tremendous energies and things that I just didn’t understand. In fairness and in accuracy, yes; but, I didn’t actually grow up in a religious background. My mother was Anglican; my father was raised in the Greek Orthodox Church. His family was somewhat religious, but he was a physicist; he was a scientist. I was always interested in metaphysics; I converted to Judaism. My husband was Jewish, not practicing; he was also a scientist.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">But, then I experienced very deep interest in Buddhism and Hinduism and became a discipline of Parmahansa Yogananda. I spent a lot of time investigating the teachings and practices of the East. Then I had some very powerful mystical experiences in the early ‘90s. I was trying to reconcile all of these different experiences and inputs and wrap my head around them. I really didn’t have a framework large enough that everything was able to fit in there.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">But now I think, with the internet there’s enough out there and there’s enough published and I’ve found other people who are doing shamanic work that have helped me to be able to anchor and ground some of these energies. It’s beginning to find legs, so to speak. It’s finally beginning to be alright, I hope.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It’s been very challenging; nothing in 3D really prepares you. In mainstream reality, consensus reality, you’re considered crazy. They would want to pump you full of Prozac and lock you away. Hopefully we’re out of the woods.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Thanks for sharing. One of the funniest emails I’ve gotten in the last two weeks—because we’re transparent here and we let it all hang out—somebody sent me an email and they said, “I love listening to your shows. It’s like ‘All in the Family’ with a twist.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In any case, are you guys ready? I think I’m going to shut up. We have some great questions and interesting questions tonight. If Daphne is going to answer one, I don’t know if we’re going to have the Ra chant or not. But, if we do, we’ve explained it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Father-Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light to surround and protect Daphne, Terry, myself and everyone listening and any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and be transmuted for the highest good of all concerned.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">In fact, Daphne had made the request “Why don’t we just send it before time so it’s out of here?” I’ll go along with that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Right now we see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energies of planet earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth. We invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive service-to-others, honoring the Law of One, to join with us as we create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Do we have an opening greeting through Terry?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator. We are delighted to be with you this 26<sup>th</sup> of December, 2012. Our joy extends into the third density and we greet each and every one of you who wishes to have our presence. We do not come through the telephone lines or the radio; that is where Terry’s voice comes from, but we are non-linearly present within the space of each and every individual who wishes us to be close.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It is our honor; we feel honored to be able to connect with you. Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes, we do. The first question I’ve had from a couple of people, where they’re on our call and they experience what this person called, ‘vertigo.’ Another person was dizzy and could not get up for several minutes. When he finally did, it took a couple hours to clear. Could you explain why certain people have this kind of experience?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">I address that to our Sources speaking to us through Terry.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When one is in the third density, they use the body to ground and they use the location within the third density, the location on the planet to ground. Also they use the different body systems to ground and the chakra systems are aligned in a certain way according to each individual.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Sometimes when an individual connects to us, they then move or let go of some of the grounding that they have been anchoring themselves with. As they connect with our energies, they let go of some of the anchoring energies. This can bring disorientation. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We do not mean for you to be disoriented and so for those of you that are, we suggest that you anchor yourself; that you feel the body. Feel your chair. Keep your feet on the floor, and partake of the higher frequencies little by little so that you do not go headlong into them and then lose any other anchoring as it is not necessary to become disoriented to connect with us.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If somebody has that experience, is there an exercise they can do, or something they can do to help bring them back into their body; like, take a hot shower or eat? Or, do you have any other recommendations?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We suggest sitting still and feeling the chair, massaging your body so that you get back your orientation. When you have that orientation back, then you can begin to move around and you could have a hot shower. But to slowly massage the body; feel the chakras; feel the top of your head; feel the throat chakra; feel the heart chakra; feel your stomach; feel your bottom; feel your legs and feel your feet against the floor.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You will gradually come back to your orientation and when you’re oriented you could begin to move around and might wish to take a hot shower.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We’re going to address the question from Dee Hall that has to do– has to do with the idea that people come into this realm to be where they’ve chosen to be a victim, at something like Sandy Hook or Aurora. We’ll address this through Daphne.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Before I present this, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Dee</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> wrote a bunch of stuff, but I’m just going through it really quickly and picking out what’s important. I wanted to mention that some of you may want to do a Google search on this. It’s interesting because we were talking about the dynamic duo:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“As you know, in the </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Aurora</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Colorado</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> incident, it happened while they were watching Batman.” I’m not going to ask this question to our Sources; I don’t want them to answer this. I’m going to just leave it hanging. “In that Batman Movie, in the skyline when they were going through the skyline, there was a skyscraper that had the name ‘</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Aurora</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">’ on it. Later on in the movie, there was a map on a table that very distinctly had the words ‘</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Sandy Hook</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">’ on it.” Go do a Google search and you’ll find the videos where people put that together.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">There are only two possibilities for the answers of why that is so. One is that this was a negative plan or project and they were giving notice of it in this movie. Some people believe that’s true for many, many movies. For example, in <i>The Matrix</i>, Kenau Reaves had a passport that expired on </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">9-11-2001</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Some people think the negative uses the movies to give signals. That’s one possibility.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Another possibility is that it’s total coincidence.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Another possibility is that it’s some kind of crazy synchronicity.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You might look that up; what was the name of the Batman Movie? I’ll think of it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Dark Night Rises, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Sandy Hook</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Aurora</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">. Just put that in Google. Then, you draw your own conclusions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Going back to the question here:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Many people will say this is God’s will, or people chose it. I’m not so sure I believe that personally, but we’ll ask our Sources and we’ll get their explanation on it. Things that random, things that are negative plots… Did people come into this realm volunteering to sacrifice themselves in this way? Did they know they were going to die, or did their High Selves know they were going to die?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We do know that negative exists, because it helps everyone evolve. We also have the idea that our realm went over the deep end. On that note, let me just see here; I’ll just read a little bit of </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Dee</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">’s question:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“Is it not correct that we choose before coming into this lifetime what obstacles we will put in front of ourselves? It’s my understanding that the souls who would become these children knew prior to this lifetime they would have a short life. They volunteered to be born here and die this way so the souls of their parents could live through a very tough life lesson. The parents chose this, too.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">With that preamble, I’m going to turn it over to Daphne. I’m not sure what Source is going to come through her or who they’re going to say they are. We will see how they address this question. Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you, Wynn. One moment, please.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We greet you in the Love and the Light of The One Infinite Creator. This is Ra’An; we speak to you this day on the 26<sup>th</sup> of December, (2012). Let us attune our frequency to your question; one moment, please.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You have concerns; you have a desire to understand those incidents which, from the perspective of the 3D, the incidents we speak of are the </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Colorado</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> and the </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Connecticut</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;"> incidents.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We see that these have been requisite testing patterns. When we say “requisite testing patterns”, from our perspective there has been a soul contract; a soul alliance of those situations and those circumstances which have presented themselves in this time and this place through the architected constructs in which certain elements of challenge were introduced; however, not having foreseen certain consequence.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It is difficult for us to explain fully our meaning, as from your perspective you are still in a kind of time-flow; though, from our perspective, because you have moved through the bottle-neck of the 21<sup>st</sup> of December, you are now moving into the now time, a time beyond linear flow. When one moves into the now consciousness, the possibility of all things being present and accessing all becomes a tangible reality.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">As for the children and the parents having chosen beforehand to undergo such a dramatic and tragic episode, we would say that, in the totality of all that there is, nothing is lost. We understand, though, that this is little comfort for those that are experiencing the drama and the grief now. It is part of the soul evolution working. It is part of the way physicality experiences itself.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Whether or not it is something to be avoided or even something to be chosen is not necessarily seen from our vantage point, as we too are learning that when we posit intention it is architected and constructed and experienced in the different dimensions in ways that we cannot necessarily foresee. We learn as you learn.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We hope this has shed some Light.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Maybe I could ask a question about that, and that would be:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Are events like this predestined, or do they come about because of decisions that various entities have made within the timelines?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Again, from our vantage point we would say that there are trajectories; there are probabilities; there are flows towards certain outcomes. But whether one experiences a particularized outcome in a particular flow of space-time, along with other individuals, this is unknown until the actual transpiring of said event.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Does this answer your question?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes, it does. So maybe one could say “When someone enters into a body in this timeline, they are agreeing to whatever happens here.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And, if they happen to have that occur it goes part and parcel with their agreement, yes?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Another question, this is a general question:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">“According to history, Jesus did some amazing miracles. We have seen a number of miracles in our group, but it never seems to be as on-demand as the record indicates happened for Jesus. Is this because of the choices of the higher realms not to do obvious miracles in this realm, which I’ve read in the Ra Material, or is there another explanation?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One moment, please.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">The circumstance in which you find yourselves, the circumstance of witnessing perhaps healing, perhaps interventions but not outright, fantastic, outrageous miracles per se, we would say from our perspective, is part and parcel of the time and the place and the circumstance within which you live.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">What transpires at this time, we would say, is wholly miraculous in many ways. It is a matter of perspective. There is also the desiring of the soul contracts, at this particular time and space, to witness and to undergo and to hone and to transmit the individuated Christed Light within each and every individual, rather than have the Light posited upon what would appear to be an external Source, an external person, in which case the person would be adored or worshipped.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You are moving to a point of evolution where you are learning to take responsibility for that which ultimately heals your life. That is the notion that when you practice the Christ consciousness, miracles are possible because you are no longer standing in the way of the miraculous. You are helping; you are co-creating the miraculous. It is part and parcel of the evolutionary trajectory which humanity, or portions of humanity, has decided at this time to undergo.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This transmitting channel, only this morning, awoke with the conscious thought that as we recognize that we indeed are Christed light and our own consciousness is weaving the collective fabric of experience for the totality of the human collective and experience, when we each understand that it is our own presence, our own preciousness, our own Light, our own individual choices, which affects not only us but every single person around us, when we become that accountable, when we become that centered, when we become that balanced, when we become that living, bearing-witnessing earth angel person, we would say, because you are bringing the celestial to the earth, you are still human and yet, you are embodying divine qualities.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">When you can do that, you become yourself a living, breathing, walking, tangible bridge for the God-source Christed energies to act through you and thus transmute any imperfections, any miasmas and any difficulties on the physical plane which linger at this time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We may say you are really part of the first wave; you are the way-showers. You are the people who are crossing The Rainbow Bridge into the fifth dimension now, as we speak, by holding your frequency of love, of non-judgmentalism, of acceptance, of virtue, of stability, of grounded-ness in the Christ Light, in yourself. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You create a stabilizing influence and vibration for everyone in your life whether you physically spend time with them or not. You become, in essence, a honing beacon, a vibrational tuning rod.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">You-we are re-calibrating the base-line frequency of the earth, so that all may attune to the foundation, the foundation now being not the foundation of war or dominion; but, the foundation being the Heart of the Christ, the Christ living in each one, in every and each one of all here.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">This is indeed a momentous undertaking, one that you must acknowledge in yourselves. Give yourselves a hard-earned pat on the back; hug each other. Congratulate each other! You are pulling very, very, very difficult and long-awaited possibilities into the physical plane as we speak. You are becoming the new foundation; you are becoming the Light anchors, the Light beacons for humanity.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">We hope this has shed some Light on a very, very important line of questioning. Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you very much. That was a wonderful answer.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">It’s </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">7:55</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">; we’re supposed to be finished in two minutes. Perhaps I better not ask another question at this point.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Thank you all for bearing with us, as we were doing quite a bit of initial talking at the beginning. Part of that is becoming comfortable with Daphne being here and for her to become comfortable, because we are very lucky to have her here and available to answer these questions, as we are lucky to have Terry answer questions. To have both women available and in service to give us guidance is an incredible blessing for all of us. On that note, we will adjourn this call.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">If you had a question that wasn’t answered—there were definitely some questions I was intending to ask—a couple of personal questions from people. I’m going to put them for next week. Please ask them again; it’s okay to ask them again, because I’m not excluding the questions because they’re not of value. It’s just that we get more questions than we can answer. If you ask it again and again it shows me you have a very high intent to getting the answer. It encourages me to ask it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Some people just ask a question of curiosity and they don’t have that intent. So it makes a difference if you ask it repeatedly. On that note, we are going to open up the mics and let everyone say goodnight. </span></p>
