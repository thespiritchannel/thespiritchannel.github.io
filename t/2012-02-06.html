We are just about to conference ourselves in to BBS Radio; we’re not on BBS yet. If we’re lucky, we’ll hear Terry talking.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: Hello everyone out there in BBS Radio land. This is Terry Brown, the co-host of<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><i>The Wynn Free Monday Night Show</i>. As he was saying, maybe we need to find a new, exciting name for the show. We’ve been doing this show since about 2007 and they have archives there [on BBS Radio]. The audios are on the archives; eventually they’re going to be putting up transcripts, because we’ve been doing transcripts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn, are you on the line?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: I don’t think we should do that, no.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: We haven’t moved into it, yet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">:Terry used to be really shy; she’s still shy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: I’m getting better.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: She just overcomes it. Believe it or not, even I’m shy. I hide it, because if I don’t do this, I don’t know who else will. If anyone can do it, please email me and you’ve got to do a really good job. Gijs is afraid I’m going to say, “Gijs why don’t you do the show tonight?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">We’re continuing the topic of two weeks ago; this is going to be a really interesting call. As you guys probably know, this is totally unrehearsed. We don’t know what’s going to happen; we don’t know what the answers are. We have topics and we’re speaking to the Source that says they created the physical Universe. That’s no small deal; that’s a pretty big deal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Are they really who they say they are? I tell people, “Don’t believe it; check it out. See what they say. See how it resonates.” If I told you to believe they were who they said they were, then it would become a religion. You’d just have to be a believer and I’d say, “Now we’re going to have so-and-so connecting with us”. If you’re religious, please don’t take this personally.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">The problem with religions is, in most cases people become followers and they don’t tend to co-create. They can easily just become believers. The essence—if you go back to Jesus—you don’t even have to believe that Jesus was Jesus but if you just take what he said and say, “Hmm, could that be real?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">He said, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” He said, “As you do it to the least of these, you do it to me.” And what is He really saying here?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">He’s not that body that everyone looks at with that beautiful, reverent face. He is everything. He also was that body and he was everything because he said, “If you do it to the smallest of these, you do it to me.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">That means each person is a part of All That Is, everyone, even the people that you don’t like, even the people that have hurt you and you’ve let them hurt you. In some way or another, you’ve let that occur. Or perhaps you were in the wrong place at the wrong time or perhaps you were learning lessons of discernment or any of the above.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">It’s a big step to take total responsibility for your life. That means that if something hurt you, some part of you allowed that to occur. It doesn’t mean that you were bad; it just means that you didn’t have the discernment to keep it out. Lessons like that build discernment, because the next time the chances are, you’ll be a little bit more careful about letting somebody like that in your life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">The other problem with this whole train of thought is: I’ve seen people who were hurt. Let’s say you were hurt in a romance, really hurt bad. Instead of developing discernment, they made the decision, “Romance is bad; the opposite sex is bad. I can’t handle that. I don’t ever want to be that vulnerable again.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">That’s a worse decision than making mistakes, in my opinion, because that shuts down your growth and your experience. At least if you’re making mistakes, you’re always learning and you continue to hone yourself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">On this call tonight, although I constantly say, “Check this out with your own resonance”, two weeks ago we had not much of a channeling. It was mostly me talking and Terry talking. We talked about Saint Catherine of Siena.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">There are a number of experiences that I had, that penetrated my logical, rational mind that said, “Oh my God this is real.” You haven’t had those experiences, but I can share them and then you can decide how that would look if it happened to you. If it happened to me, and I’m one of you, then it really isn’t separate from you; it’s just that I’m the guy reporting it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">I asked the question, “Was Terry ever anybody famous?” I didn’t expect them to answer. Oftentimes people want to know if they were famous and it becomes an ego trip and they get preoccupied with it. In Terry’s case, there gave an answer. They said “Look up Saint Catherine of Siena.” Many of you know the story. When I looked Saint Catherine up, I found out that she was a channel officially recognized by the Catholic Church. She would wander into the local church and they would write down what she said. It became <i>Saint Catherine’s Dialogues with God</i>, which is still available on Amazon; still available and recognized by the Vatican. Terry is the spitting image of Saint Catherine.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Two weeks ago we actually read some excerpts from Saint Catherine, that book, her <i>Dialogues with God</i>. There was an intelligence coming through Saint Catherine that had tremendous wisdom, that was giving guidance, putting down some of the pomp and ceremony of the Catholic Church, talking about how many of the priests were more interested in their fine wardrobe and being hot-shots in front of the public, rather than being God’s emissaries. There’s lots and lots of wisdom in that book. At a previous time when I asked the question, they said it was the Ra group coming through Saint Catherine.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Two weeks ago, we just talked about it; we read some excerpts from the book of Saint Catherine’s dialogues. I thought it would be a good follow-up to ask some questions to our Sources about this incident and in general, how they decide when they’re going to speak through someone. We’ve never really discussed this, so this is going to be unfolding for me as it is for you. I think it’s going to be very interesting.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Some of you, I know, have said, “I want to be a channel. I want them to speak through me.” Wanting to be a channel, knowing what I know now, I would say I wouldn’t want to be a channel if I knew all that was involved. This is because when you have a voice coming through you, an Intelligence, how do you know who’s talking through you?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">“Oh, they said they were Jesus”. How do you know it was Jesus? “They said they were the Elohim”. How do you know it was the Elohim? It took me three years of saying, “I think they might be who they said they are” and then, once I understood that even if you’re talking to the Elohim this week, how do you know next week it’s going to be the same Source.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">They could say they’re the Elohim, but the negative can lie. How do you know? Who wants that responsibility of putting stuff out into the world and maybe making a mistake? Here I am, I’m putting this out into the world and I’m still careful and I still double-check.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">If you don’t know how to figure it out and you just have voices speaking through you, the chances are, sooner or later, even if you start out with a positive Source, you’re going to have negative sources interspersed. In certain cases, you may just be misleading people and who wants to do that?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Carla Rueckert said that if you want to protect yourself from negative sources, only ask questions that are as true 10,000 years from now as they are now; like Universal Truths. The negative has no interest in answering those kinds of questions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">When you ask questions that are more transitory, like “Is Los Angeles going to go in the ocean next week?” that could tempt a negative source. “Is so-and-so positive?” that could tempt negative source. We do cross the edge; we do sometimes ask such questions and I monitor it very carefully.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">I think one of the reasons that we stay positive is because Terry has such a high intent for service and so do I. I probably have had lots of past life experiences dealing with this, making mistakes, which I have done. I have honed this to a place where we’ve gotten good at it. But I still tell you: make your own decision; don’t believe it because I say so, because I could make a mistake; Terry could make a mistake. Before you’d know it, we’d be putting out something that is the wrong polarity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">If you want to channel, you’re going to have to face this. In fact, one of the best things is if you get voices talking to you; ask them for guidance for yourself. Don’t go running around saying, “I’ve got these messages; do you guys want to hear?” Get guidance for yourself and apply their guidance. If it works, it’s one indication of a possibility of a positive Source, because they’re wise and they’re giving you good counsel and wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Do that for quite some time before you even consider sharing it with anyone else, because as soon as you share something with someone else, as soon as you do that, you are in the position of getting attention. Attention is a commodity and if you have the least bit of attachment to attention, again you have another entrée for a negative source, because you will want to please people instead of being true to the spirit of the messages coming through you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">When you want to please people, you’ll unconsciously start saying things that will please them and make them be interested in you. You get attached to it; so, you have to be totally detached from that level of recognition.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">I still like gratitude; gratitude is different than recognition. I love it when we do things and we get emails from people and they share how something we did changed their life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">That motivates me and I know it motivates Terry. We put a lot into this, in case you haven’t noticed. We’re doing three calls a week; we’re answering emails. I can’t always but I try to answer emails and, we’re certainly not getting paid for it. We do appreciate the people who are doing donations and purchasing the little things that we sell. No way does it compensate us for the work we’ve been doing for a long time at this point.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">When we get emails that we contributed to somebody’s life, that’s really a pay-off; that’s really nice. That’s different than attention. That means we actually accomplished something.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Terry, is there anything you would like to say? Are you there, Terry?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: It’s an honor to be able to connect with the Guys, the Higher Sources: the Elohim and the Ra group. It’s so much of an honor. Their positions on things are so beneficial. I’m just honored that I can be able to do this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: We’re going to call in the Light, which is our way of invoking a group energy. When we do this it’s not just words. If you come on these calls often, you’ll know that something shifts. You’ll learn to feel the shift; you may not feel it for the first month or the first six months. Sometimes you’re hearing it and it’s just really good information and wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">There definitely is an energy present when we do these calls that you can learn to tune into. It’s our understanding that energy is the Sources projecting into this realm. From their explanations, they only honor free will, so they’re not going to come in unless we ask. They’re not going to come in for you unless you ask, so you can open yourself up to the possibilities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Before you ask, you should be sure you trust it. I don’t encourage people to rush that process, because you’re dealing with bringing in an energy from an intelligence that you can’t see, that’s in another dimension. For me, the experience of it is that it’s a very loving energy; it makes me feel loved. It makes us love each other.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">That’s some sort of validation right there. If it was negative, I can’t imagine it would make me feel loved; it would make me feel dependent. A negative source would make you feel dependent, or addicted, or doing their bidding. This Source does not require any of that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">We’re going to call in the Light and bring in that energy:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Father-Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light to surround and protect Terry, myself, everyone present on this and everyone present on the replays. And any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, thought the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the Solar System, through the sun, through the moon, through the outer energy fields of planet Earth, through our bodies and into the center of the Earth. Right now, we invoke a group consciousness, a blending of energies of all of us present, while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring The Law of One to join with us and we create a protected space that only the Positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><i>now</i>.</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">We await our Sources’ presence.</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator. We are delighted to be with you in the Earth plane and make connections as you are ready for a connection, or wish connection to be made with you. We have a very high frequency; which it may be hard to isolate out, as it is so much higher than the general frequency of the Earth plane.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">We are at the higher band of frequencies and we are available for you to ask for assistance. We generally give assistance when asked, although sometimes we give assistance based upon consensus reality.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"> Yes. I want to make a comment about assistance. I’ve had two emails this week and I have one personal experience; three people commented how they put a relationship in the Light and something shifted in the relationship. For example, my sister. My sister and her husband come on the calls occasionally and she’s still in a lot of pain; she’s not like hopping around, jumping around. She was in tremendous pain a few days ago, and I told Larry, “Why don’t we just start calling in the Light, the three of us”? We did.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">When we did that, we started putting her son in the Light, who is going through a bunch of his own stuff, difficult stuff. I hadn’t really talked to him for a few years, even though I like him, I kind of intimidate him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Suddenly, two days ago, he called me and we had the best conversation we’ve had in years and really connected. You could see the process that because we put him into the Light, it sent a silent signal through the ethers that he picked up. He didn’t know what it was; it just felt good.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">There was someone else that had that same experience with their father, who talked about it. Someone else who had that same experience with their daughter, I believe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">You can start to get the feel of how this works and how to utilize these connections to change your vibratory field with people around you. Of course, we always do this for the highest good of all concerned and honoring free will. The theory is, if we get enough people doing this, we would shift the entire planet. Even if we don’t shift the entire planet, each of you has the opportunity to shift your own space, your own relationships. If you do that, that will be a miracle unto itself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">I thought we’d turn it over and maybe they can comment on how that looks from their side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">When you have an individual or group of individuals that are at odds with consensus reality, with the service-to-other concepts or paradigms and are using service-to-self paradigms, they can be overridden by the pure mechanics of how things work when the consensus reality is in favor of the service-to-other concepts and in favor of the good of humanity, in favor of the individual person working in service-to-others ways to support his-her families to bring the good into the life, to bring growth into the life of the people they love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">This is a consensus when enough people are believing and carrying out this posture; they can then take over and the consensus or the minor consensus of the service-to-self individuals then can take a back-seat to the service-to-other individuals’ consensus reality.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">The work that you are doing in bringing in the Light and bringing in the higher us, the higher forces, is helping to create a consensus for the benefit of each of the service-to-other individuals and indeed, to each individual, even though the service-to-self individuals do not know or understand it. It’s helping to create a reality that can foster growth of the individual in learning and actually realizing more the ability to love and to be connected with fellow man than would have been without the work that you and other Light workers are doing. It is all adding up to help make a shift towards the benefit of all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">:<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>From your perspective, we’re going to ask about Saint Catherine. Let’s ask a general overview question. We have two group souls; we have the Ra group; we have the Elohim group. In this circumstance on these calls, they have said they’re collaborating to work with us because, I would guess, we have learned to pick up both frequencies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">When you’re out there wherever you reside energetically, how do you come to a decision to make a communication through someone, such as you obviously made a decision with myself and Daphne and you made a decision with Saint Catherine. Maybe it was not the same Sources making the decision; maybe one was the Ra group, one was the Elohim group and one just evolved in an unusual manner.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">What is the criterion for making a decision?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: We look at the individual and see the purity of the individual and whether the individual can bring through an undistorted message, as in Terry’s case she never fully materialized into the physical Universe and as such remains in the highest state in an undistorted state that can give and take information and impart it. We are always on the lookout for someone that we can connect with that wishes and can bring through pertinent information.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">It takes someone that will not use the data for detrimental purposes or twist the data to give a wrong impression. It takes an individual who is able to de-manifest and get out of the way enough that the information can come through clearly. Terry is and Saint Catherine is/was in that posture, because of their intention to bring through the higher information from the Higher Sources, which is the Elohim and the Ra group.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">They both work/worked to bring through pertinent data, to help individuals to open their hearts to decrease the ego, to connect with home, so the individuals know that they are not alone and they know that there is hope; there is a way back; there is a family of which they are a part.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: Thank you. There has to be another added circumstance to that decision, because we know that there was the life of Saint Catherine and of course the life of Terry. But, there are a lot of lifetimes in between, (one) where Terry was knifed; she had bad relationships; things were screwy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">There must be the added factor that a person not only has the connection, but they’ve created connections in this realm that would allow the communications to come through safely. Am I correct there?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: In the case of Terry, give us a moment… She has worked long and hard to be able to discern accurately what is around her and observe what is around her without regard to any ego circumstances. She has worked long and hard in this lifetime to dispel any influences that would intercede in the connection. Give us a moment…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">The individual has to be inclined to do it, and in other lifetimes Terry did not encounter situations which would foster such connection, although the connection was there, they did not foster the connection of developing it to move into a communicative relationship with us that would allow us to come through or did not have a circumstance available in that lifetime, a platform, to allow it to come through.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">So essentially, what is needed is a grounding and a platform to allow Terry to be open to bring forth the information and an inclination and an exposure on her part, a connection made, to bring through the higher Sources: us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">As Saint Catherine, there was the connection with the monastery; there was the incessant seeking of Terry/Saint Catherine to bring through the information, to make the connection available from the very Highest Sources, so that it could benefit and help Terry/[Catherine] grow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Not only help Terry/[Catherine] grow, but to help the monastery individuals grow; to help the Catholic Church grow; to place more and more people in a posture that they would be able to connect with the Higher Sources and begin to allow the heavenly—we search for a word here—the heavenly manifestation to enter into the earthly realm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: Was there a decision made before Terry incarnated that this would occur, or was it something that’s happenstance, where the right people were at that church and she happened to show up and open the energies up. Was there a pre-birth agreement or was it a situation of happenstance?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: There was an agreement that Terry made before she entered into the third density to bring through information and to stay pure. That’s why Saint Catherine did not wish to have sex and did not wish to enter into so much of the earthly sensations and the pay-offs of sensations, for fear that she would pollute the connection with Home, with the Higher Sources, with the Highest on High and then would not be able to purely bring through information.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">That is why she declined sex and did not wish to marry, except to marry and to have even the slight manifestation of the wedding ring of bonding with God and Higher Sources, so that she would remain pure to bring through only the purest of information that could be then known. She viewed the church at the time and saw certain things that were going in a heretical direction and she sought to correct them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: Thank you. Is it kind of experimental, when a soul of the nature of Terry comes into this realm, that there’s the possibility for this any life, but they don’t know, until they’re in the life and the circumstances present themselves that it happens? Maybe they go through a lot of difficult lifetimes, really difficult ones, until one happens to have the right circumstances that allow these kinds of messages to come through.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Is that the way it works?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: The intention is always there and the intention is always purWhen the portal opens, the codes agree, the sectors come into alignment to allow this kind of a life to take it’s fruit, to bear it’s fruit; then is when you get this connection, where the individual is pure with intention and to bring through the essence of the Higher Sources without adding anything from the Earth realm, any pollution, any distortion from the lower realms; to bring through the essential being of Spirit, purely without any misidentification within the channel that brings pollution into the information given.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">This was the pure intention of the being and when the doorways are right and in synchronicity for the bringing through of the information and the coincidence with the individual bringing it through, it’s like a camera coming into focus. Then, all of the doorways are connected and there are no<span class="apple-converted-space"> locked</span> geometrical obstacles in the way coming in from the pollution from the lower intensities. Then, like a lens, the information can come through.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: It seems like sometimes you Guys might make, I won’t call it a mistake, but, you’ll start to work with someone with positive hopes of having a good connection and then it gets polluted because the person’s ego might get in the way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Has that been an experience that you’ve found yourself in?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">: There are different circumstances involving different people, and we realize that we work with people that may have not fully realized themselves and we see their pure heart and we work with them. However, as their perceptions are not fully developed, or they have not totally developed their super-abilities; or, how to sufficiently handle their superior abilities in the third dimension, then they can cause some havoc, because they have not yet developed the ability to handle their full range of abilities; psychological abilities, or their full range of perception, or their full connection with the third dimension and also bringing through of the Higher Sources.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">They have not got it fully under control and do not know how to fully synchronize themselves with the third dimension and so can look like they are causing a problem. This is one of the ways that individuals can start out looking good in their channeling and then not know how to fully handle everything and so they look like they have gone off on a tangent. That is one of the things that can happen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Another thing is that the individual can have unhandled deviations or distortions which they don’t believe in their mind. We say it another way. In their mind, they have certain distortions which they totally believe and cannot conceive of another way of looking at it, or a higher way of looking at it and they totally believe within their mind certain principles. So that when they are given data, they discount it in favor of their own beliefs and bring through what could be, in some instances, good data, however it is not the data that we had imparted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Terry has worked through this, so she has observed this at the beginning of her channeling, observed this to some degree within herself and has let it go.</span></p>
