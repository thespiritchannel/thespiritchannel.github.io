Wherever in the world you are or when you may be reading a transcript or when you may be listening to an audio of a replay, we welcome you. This is the BBS Wynn Free Monday night hour. My name is Terry Brown and I’m the co-host of the show and he is out rounding up the people on the conference line. This is a simulcast, meaning people are on a conference and people are on BBS Radio. If someone calls in on a conference line then they are patched in and can hear the show that way. On BBS Radio they can hear it on their computer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">These programs are archived by BBS Radio and one can subscribe and can hear all the back Mondays of Wynn Free or any other BBS show that has been broadcast. Wynn also has something called <i>The Spirit Channel</i> and individuals can get transcripts of the audios by subscribing to <i>TheSpiritChannel</i>. We don’t have a full house or a full range of transcripts yet; however, the transcripts are being done and put up on the archives of <i>The Spirit Channel</i> and they are sent out as they are done to individuals who subscribe to <i>The Spirit Channel</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>(<a href="http://www.thespiritchannel.net">www.thespiritchannel.net</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is free.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Wynn has three conference calls a week. One of them is a grid healing which is on Sunday and we make information available. We do a healing, a grid healing and I do a channeling and we have individuals tell what their concerns are and what they would like to put in the Light that week, such things as growth situations, economic situations and sometimes people will put people that they know in the Light that are having a difficult situation or time. Then we have the Monday night call and I do a channeling on this call often; however, I never know what the topic is beforehand. I don’t know what the topic is tonight and I prefer to not know beforehand.<br /><br /></span></p>

We get up in the morning and I say “How about if I say this and you say that?” We work it all out so we look good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">This is Wynn Free; this is Monday, November 7, 2011 in Sedona, with my co-host Terry Brown. We’re actually both co-hosts and we’re doing our Monday night conference call coordinated with our conference line. We have a really interesting topic tonight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">These calls are very interesting to me. You have to find out if it’s interesting to you. Those of you who have been listening regularly know that I have been involved in an on-going dialogue with some Sources in other dimensions; at least they identify themselves that way. They have explained themselves to be group souls, two group souls. One of them is the Elohim group which created the physical Universe and the other is the Ra group, which is made up of graduates, souls that went through periods in physical bodies and graduated and act as helpers and guides for those of us who are still here in confusion. I always tell people; “Don’t believe any of that; that’s how they describe themselves. But the best way to come to your own conclusion is by the nature of their answers on these calls.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><br /><br /> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">If you’d like to go check out our archives, they’re not very well presented at this point but they are there at <i>thespiritchannel.net.</i> You can listen to our archives and in some cases read them, because there are transcripts. Again I say, the best way to decide as to the source of our communications is by your own impact. There should be an impact if they are who they say they are. For many of the people who have been paying attention to these calls there has been an impact. There have been a lot of transformations, personal growth, all kinds of things. There is a reason why that happens and how that works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><br /><br /> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">One of the topics tonight has to do with the reason. This is one of those calls where I’m going try to make this simple, so that you all can understand it and in spite of the fact that I barely understand it. I had a lot of ah-ha’s this past week as I listened to a video that was on YouTube, an excerpt from the movie <i>What the</i> <i>*Bleep* Do We Know?</i>”<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Did any of you watch the part of the video about particle versus wave? Yes, you did. Oh, thank you. It was on the particle versus wave phenomena and it was showing some things that were very interesting. Seth is prepared to play the audio tract of the video, but first I thought I would tell you what I saw when I watched that video. After we hear the audio I will give my cognitions on it and then we’re going to talk to our Sources and see if we’re going in the right direction and what they can share from that perspective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">This goes right to the very nature of the physical Universe, the very fundamental nature. If we’re talking to the Elohim and if they created the physical Universe then they should be able to answer this. Can Terry’s mind bring through the answers? It has to go through the formation of her vocabulary; sometimes there are limitations to concepts that she can understand, although there are times when she has brought through concepts which she didn’t understand and still make them understandable. <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>We do this live; really, we haven’t rehearsed this; Terry has no idea what we’re talking about and what we are going to be asking about. She has demonstrated the ability over and over again to go into a trance, or an altered state, where she is able to pick up on her antenna these voices from other dimensions. This has been going on in my life for probably eight years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We do it publicly. It was a little scary the very first time we ever did it publicly. It’s always a little scary. One of the reasons it’s scary is because any time you do something like this there is always the chance that whoever talks to you is not who they say they are. I don’t believe that’s happened much on our calls. I think what protects us is the high intent of both Terry and myself. I tell people you must decide; we’re not presenting this as truth. What we can present as truth is the experiments that were done on the wave particle stuff. Let’s see if I can describe this verbally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <br /><br /> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">If you imaged shooting marbles out of a gun through a slit, some of the marbles, would bounce off the metal before there was a slit (the slit is in the metal). Others would go through the slit, and if they passed through the slit, if there was a screen you could capture them and you were shooting hundreds of marbles, you would have a solid line of marbles hitting that screen. It would all be a reflection of the slit; the screen would look like the slit. That’s a physical object going through a slit. If you had a second slit and you were shooting marbles and it was going through both slits now, and it was hitting the screen on the other side of the slit you’d have two lines on that screen that were looking like the slits, the same geometries of the slits, because the slit would define the trajectory or the path of the marbles. Do you understand that Terry?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><br />&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m just checking to see if I’m explaining this correctly. On this video it was saying suppose you put water through one slit, there were waves of water hitting the slit instead of marbles. What would happen with water is that you’d get waves on the other side. <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">If the screen was showing the water, it would show at the center of the screen the brightest area where the water was hitting. Then it would fade off along to the side with more slits in waves. If you put two slits and the water was going through, you now have these two waves coming through each of the slits. It’s really quite different than with marbles, because the waves interact and they either add or they subtract and you get multiple forms on the screen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">With that, I think I’m going to have Seth play the tape and that will give you the visualization of what he’s talking about, when he talks about a slit that they’re shooting electrons through or they’re having water come towards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Are you there, Seth? Can you play that audio?<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">The Audio:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Here we are, the granddaddy of all quantum weirdness: the infamous double-slit experiment. To understand this experiment, we first need to see how particles, or little balls of matter act. If we randomly shoot a small object, say a marble, at the screen, we see a pattern on the back wall where they went through the slit and hit. Now if we add a second slit, we would expect to see a second band duplicated to the right. <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Let’s look at waves. The waves hit the slit and radiate out, striking the back wall with the most intensity directly in line with the slit. The line of brightness on the back screen shows that intensity. This is similar to the line the marbles make.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">But when we add the second slit, something different happens. If the top of one wave meets the bottom of another wave, they cancel each other out. So now there is an interference pattern on the back wall, places where the two tops meet are the highest intensity, the bright lines and where they cancel, there is nothing.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">So when we throw things, that is, matter, through two slits, we get these two bands of hits. And with waves, we get an interference pattern of many bands. Good so far; now let’s go quantum.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">An electron is a tiny, tiny bit of matter like a tiny marble. Let’s fire a stream through one slit. It behaves just like the marble: a single band. So if we shoot these tiny bits through two slits, we should get, like the marbles, two bands.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">What—an interference pattern? We fired electrons, tiny bits of matter, through but we get a pattern like waves, not like little marbles. How? How could pieces of matter create an interference pattern like a wave? It doesn’t make sense.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">But, physicists are clever. They thought maybe those little balls are bouncing off each other and creating that pattern. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>So they decide to shoot electrons through one at a time; there is no way they could interfere with each other. But after an hour of this, the same interference pattern is seen to emerge. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The conclusion is inescapable: the single electron leaves as a particle, becomes a wave of potentials, goes through both slits and interferes with itself to hit the wall like a particle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Mathematically, it’s even stranger. It goes through both slits AND it goes through neither. And it goes through just one and it goes through just the other. All of these possibilities are in superposition with each other. Physicists were completely baffled by this. They decided to peek and see which slit it actually goes through. They put a measuring device by one slit and see which one it went through and let it fly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><br /><br /> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">But the quantum world is far more mysterious than they could have imaged. When they observed, the electron went back to behaving like a little marble; it produced the pattern of two bands, not an interference pattern of many.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The very act of measuring, or observing, which slit it went through meant it only went through one, not both. The electron decided to act differently, as though it was aware it was being watched. And it was here that physicists stepped forever into the strange, never-world of quantum events: What is matter--marbles or waves?<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">And, waves of what? And what does an observer have to do with any of this? The observer collapsed the wave function simply by observing.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t know if you guys could understand that, or visualize it, but the thing that it was saying is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>they weren’t talking about marbles; now they were talking about electrons being shot through a slit. <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When electrons were just shot through one slit, when there was only one slit, it would look like marbles hitting the screen, it would look like a line on the other side. <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When electrons were shot through two slits, there was some kind of interaction, so the pattern on the screen looked like a wave. The Physicists were experimenting and even when they sent one electron out at a time, it still looked like a wave. Somehow or another, it was as if that electron divided between the two slits and had a wave function on the screen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">So, through one slit it looked like a particle; through two slits it looked like a wave. When they started to observe the electrons, before they hit the slit on the front side of the slit, the act of observation turned it back into a particle. However they were measuring it, the act of observation turned it into a particle. I’m going to open the lines up and see if everyone understands that so far. Are you guys following this?<br /><br /></span></p>

Nonetheless, using the tools of measurement in this realm this is the way it comes out. I don’t think you can understand in a logical way, in the way that two plus two equals four, because this does not make logical sense. The difference between a particle and a wave, perhaps you don’t understand that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Let’s look at understanding that for a moment.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Let’s look at particles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’re used to a physical Universe that is made up of particles. Your table is solid; your body is solid. We have this intuitive sense that there is something present there, physical; we know what that means, but we may not understand all the ramifications of it. But, we know what it means. <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Let’s go now look at a wave. Since we’re using waves here in terms of the ocean for example and we see waves coming in. Of course, this is not an exact analogy to quantum physics, because the waves are still physical, they’re still ‘solid’ in one way. But, they are waves in another. They act differently as waves than they would as solids. Waves, when they go through… <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Gijs:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is fluid, right? That makes a big difference, I think.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Wynn:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Well, it’s fluid. But, we’re still at waves in <span style="color: black;">physical.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">For example, put your hand out in front of you, so it’s extended from your body and put all your fingers together and move your hand back and forth from left to right, left, right, left, right, left, right. <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Actually, you are creating a wave motion. If you notice that wave is moving air back and forth, left and right. If you’re doing it at the speed I’m saying, it would be like one cycle per second--left, right, left right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Suppose you speed it up, maybe that’s four cycles per second. That’s taking a solid object and moving it back and forth.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We can look at radio waves. Radio waves are not solid objects at all, as far as I know; they’re frequencies of electromagnetism that can move through the air. Where you’re sitting right now, you’re in the middle of a bunch of radio waves; they’re all passing through your body. You’re probably in the middle of a bunch of HAARP waves that are being generated for negative reasons; your television set can pick up radio waves and convert them into visual images. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Waves have different properties than particles. For example, if you throw a marble at your wall, when it hits the wall it stops. When you aim a radio wave at <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>your wall, it continues. We’re all talking on cell phones right now and we’re all using waves going through all kinds of instruments everywhere.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>It starts out from my voice going into an audio, into a microphone and coming out, going through a bunch of wave forms, and coming out on the other end. You guys are listening through your ears and the same thing is happening over the internet. Waves and particles are different.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When you start looking at the building blocks of the Universe, you’re looking at an electron for example, as they were talking about. The electron will sometimes behave as a particle and sometimes behave as a wave. That is an incredible mystery, as to why it should do that. Perhaps it’s always a wave, but the wave can look like a particle and we can ask those questions. I have asked them. I don’t completely understand the answers.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Where it started triggering me when I watched that video, see if you can follow this with me. Oftentimes we talk about our body and our energy bodies. Our bodies are rigid in this dimension and yet our energy bodies move through dimensions. In a sense, it seems to me that our energy bodies are more like waves.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">For example, if you’re on our grid healing Sunday, we move our energy bodies through the ceiling; at least we say we do. Things happen; we feel shifts. We feel ourselves connecting. If our energy bodies are waves, then when we all connect by the laws of quantum mechanics, the waves, we’re making frequencies beating against each other. <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There’s something new that comes into the mix when we combine our energies. It seems that is what happens. It seems like when Jesus said, “When two or more are gathered, I am also present”. It seems that might be what he was talking about, energies coming together and creating new frequencies that were not there before they came together.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I was thinking about this and I was thinking about myself. I was thinking about how, when I’m creating something for the first time, I have this idea of not talking to anyone about it. I’ve learned even in metaphysical stuff there is this idea of holding the energy. When you’re starting something, don’t talk about it until it gets anchored.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I know sometimes, Terry can watch this; I have this little RV. If I have to make a bunch of phone calls, sometimes I will leave the house, go into my little RV and make phone calls, because I don’t want my frequencies to be encumbered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Years ago, I used to do this. I used to have to make phone calls; I would go to a phone booth. There weren’t as many cell phones at that time. It was funny, but somehow I had this feeling of being encumbered when I was in someone else’s field.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I took that to the idea of when they started monitoring the electrons that were going through the slit, the act of monitoring them shifted them from being a wave to a particle. I started to think about myself. “If somebody is watching what I’m doing, there is a whole other shift in the way my energy works.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <br /><br /> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Oftentimes, I set things up so nobody can watch what I’m doing or nobody can hear what I’m doing. I’m not even in the field of someone who can monitor my field to see what I’m doing, because I’ve had the experience of having these amazing synchronicities in my life. I didn’t quite understand it.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I’m applying these principles of quantum mechanics; when something observes the electron it turns into a particle. I kept thinking, “That feels like what I experience, that when somebody observes me, I turn into a particle.” Another way of saying that would be; I’m linear; I’m solid. When I’m a wave I can travel anywhere; I can move through walls and suddenly there are synchronicities and there’s magic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <br /><br /> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I said, “I think this wave function of a human is another way of looking at spiritual energy.” There’s this field; all of you have heard this field referred to one way or another, whether it’s the Unified field, the infinite ocean of Divine love and mercy, the Holy Spirit. That field, I’m hypothesizing, is a wave and it follows the patterns of waves. I may have it completely wrong, because we’re going to talk them and they may say, “Wynn, you’re wrong. You don’t have it.”<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Continuing this postulate is that all of us want to do things and change our lives, most of us, in one way or another. Usually the first thing we do is talk it over with our spouse; we call our friends up and tell everybody what we’re doing and suddenly it doesn’t happen. I’ve looked at it in the past; it’s like saying you have all these people’s energies, or thought-forms, in your own mind and they don’t believe you could do that. If they don’t believe you can do that and you’ve talked about them, you’ve told them what you’re going to do and they don’t believe it can happen. You’ve told them what you’re going to do before it happens. Then essentially, you’ve blocked your own mind from expanding into the field that can create that to happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Things happen non-linearly. When you do things without moving into the field you’re operating, the Bible calls it “by the sweat of the brow”. Anyone could get a job, work and do productions, so somebody else earns money off of them and they get a percentage of the money called their paycheck. That’s very linear.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Imagine that you went out one day and you said, “I’m getting this feeling; I’m going into this coffeehouse or this place and have a cup of coffee”. I do this all the time; I walk in and I sit next to somebody and I start talking to them and it is like they are the embodiment of something I was thinking about.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Let’s suppose I was looking for a job and I sat next to that guy and he said, “Man, you’re just the person. I really like having you around. You can do this for me”, whatever it is. Suddenly I have a job where I’m not just creating money for someone else. There’s nothing wrong with creating money for someone else, but I have a job where somebody really likes me, appreciates me at a deeper level and I’m supporting the energy of his business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I look at some of these businesses that have become very successful because there is a cohesive energy in the business that radiates out to the customers. Two of the businesses I think about are Starbucks and Kinkos. When you go in those businesses, whoever works there usually feels like they’re really being themselves, particularly in Starbucks. They don’t feel like they’re working; they’re greeting you; they’re happy to see you; they’re happy to have a job; they connect well with the other people there.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There’s a magic in that kind of relationship; there’s a magic because the energy is grounded all the way from the human side to the big business. Another place where you can see that magic manifested; let’s look at the Beatles; let’s look at John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Why did they get so successful? I think because they all went into their energy fields and combined energies and it blasted the world in a very magical way. They also had the right managers; they also grounded everything in the physical.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The magic part of it, like the magic part of Starbucks, the magic part of Kinkos and I’m sure there are many other companies, like maybe Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream, I’m picking little things that I’m fairly certain that energy was present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <br /><br /> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Certainly, if we</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> look at Jesus it was present and it created a foundation of energy that went far beyond those people, whether they cared about whether they were earning money or not earning money, they were dedicated to something and they created the field. In that field are our Sources; in that quantum field are the, I call them Sources; they’re a big part of the field. They can jump into the field; they can be right next to you because there’s no time in the field. <span style="color: #0070c0;">T</span>hey jump into the field; maybe the reason Terry can bring them through is because she has learned to merge her field in a quantum way with the field of the Universe and they can then talk through her field and she can formulate words. Are you there, Terry?<br /><br /></span></p>

A way of looking is, suppose you were in a body of water and you threw a big boulder into the water so it created waves. Then you were monitoring the strength of the waves when they came to shore that there would not just be one wave as you went to the left and right, there would be other parts of the wave that were hitting the shore at lesser magnitudes. But right at the center, directly, it would be the strongest magnitude of wave.<br /><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator. This is the 7<sup>th</sup> of November, 2011 and we are mindful of the information that you are seeking by watching this experiment with particles. We refer you to information that is available in <i>The Creator God Book</i> about the creation of matter and the reason that electrons have both particles and waves. When you get more basic, then the marble, the particle, you see that it is all a wave function that is then created into particles by the intersection of spinningnesses within different intentionally spinning units, so that when two units are similar, they are in a housing and spinning in their own (unit); each unit is spinning.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In its spinningness, it intersects in certain cycles of its spinning; it intersects another housing that is also spinning. It then creates the apparentcy of solid matter. So when you have a slit that you are moving one electron at a time through, there is the interaction of the spinningnesses within that solid matter and the edge of the slit. <br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Now when you consider a human consciousness, human consciousnesses are spinningnesses that are together, that move at certain frequencies and collection of frequencies, depending upon the frequency collection of the individual and they use these frequencies in their<span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span><span style="color: black;">grasping</span> and connection with the world.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">They use their spinningnesses, give us a moment, they use their frequencies in connection to the world around them and this is how they ground to the World.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <br /><br /> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">If you take a blanket that has been used by an individual for a period of time, it carries the frequencies of that individual. When one holds the blanket and they’re sensitive they can feel the frequencies, within the blanket, of that person, so there are radiating energies from the blanket. There are radiating energies-frequencies from the individual person. So these interact when you have an observer; these interact with the electrons that are being shot out into the space that goes through the slit.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">This interaction “dumbs down” the vibration, the effects and interacts with the vibration to so to speak, “dumb it down”, so that when it goes through the slits then it has already been dumbed down by the observation and acts more like the marble.<br /><br /></span></p>

There was an area where you were talking about, this has been a stumbling in my own understanding, a frequency that’s in a ‘housing’. I keep asking myself, “What is the housing? What is the housing made of? If a frequency is in a housing, what is the housing? And how does the housing get created? Is the housing the beat frequency between two crisscrossing frequencies? Does that create a housing? Where does the housing come from to hold the energy of the spinningness?”<br /><br /></span></p>

It can refer then, to the space or the area that is projected out by the intention for the spinning to occupy a certain space. Although “Housing” is a very loose term because there is no physical housing there. It is merely the space which didn’t used to be a space but is now defined as a space by the activity going on within that space. Does that make sense?<br /><br /></span></p>

A wave-form can manifest in one way, in which way we call it a wave. And a wave-form can manifest in another way, in which case we call it a particle. But it’s all the wave-form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The question is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Why is it that when the wave-form is manifesting as a particle and something then observes that particle, it reverts back into manifesting as a wave? Is it because the observing object creates a wave-form in the act of observation, that then interacts with the other wave-form and causes it revert from what looks like a particle to what looks like a wave?<br /><br /></span></p>

According to the video, when the particles are moving through the two slots and when they’re observed, they’re observed by some kind of electronic method of observing electrons. When they’re observed, their manifestation reverts to a wave manifestation.<br /><br /></span></p>
