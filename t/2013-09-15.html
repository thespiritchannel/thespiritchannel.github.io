<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I’m going to start out with a song today. Whenever I play this song I think of Carla. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Now, I had this song I was going to play and now it doesn’t show up in my list, how can that be? I looked that up this morning and there it was. Maybe I dreamed it – that it was here, that I was supposed to play this song … I’m scrolling through here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: What song?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: What song? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yeah. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I wanted to play the song from <i>The Man of LaMancha</i>, the Don Quixote song.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: <i>Dream the Impossible Dream</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: <i>Dream the Impossible Dream</i> which happens to be Carla’s logo. Now, believe it or not, 20 minutes ago I looked at this list of songs and I said that’s what I’m going to play today. Now either my mind is blanking it out as I go through it again because it was there or, I was dreaming it when I was looking at it and it’s not there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: It is. Isn’t titled as <i>Reach Out</i>? Like the fifth song from the top?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: No, it’s not <i>Reach Out</i>. It’s called <i>Dream the Impossible Dream</i>. Alright, I’m going to play <i>Reach Out</i>, okay? <i>Reach Out</i>, here we go. [Music] <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You know what, I found it. [Laughter] I’m going to play it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Before I play <i>Impossible Dream</i> I wanted to say that one of the people who attend our calls, Gary Brownlee, and who helps immensely on sending out emails and keeping the website The Spirit Channel updated, was involved in an historic project. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I don’t know if <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gary</st1:place></st1:city>’s listening, I hope he is. Because on this call, one of the things that we endeavor to do and we may be doing it, is being able to project our energies, project our fields outside of our bodies, outside of our homes, outside of our planet and outside of the solar system. Now of course, we’re dealing in invisible things so we have to watch things over a period of time to decide if we’re actually doing that and what the manifestations of that are. There is feeling that comes in, there’s a sense that many of you feel and connect with on these calls and then say, <i>what’s that</i>? That’s an unusual feeling. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Then we have voices that talk to us that say they’re outside of all of that. They’re greater than all of that. They’re larger than all of that or I don’t even know if you can use the word larger or smaller. If I can’t figure [it] out – they’re probably both larger and smaller because I don’t think there’s size where they are. [Laughter] <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But nonetheless Gary Brownlee has now become one of those rare people on the planet who actually was involved in sending a physical object outside of the solar system. He used to work for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and he was working on the Voyager which I guess you wouldn’t call it a satellite, but it’s a space vehicle, and the Voyager has just left the solar system. It’s the first object to ever leave the solar system and thank you, <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gary</st1:place></st1:city> for being part of that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now I wonder if that means if part of your hologram is out there with the Voyager. I believe <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gary</st1:place></st1:city>’s name is written somewhere in that vehicle. So in any case, I thought I would share that and I found <i>Dream the Impossible Dream</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Those of you that have visited Carla’s website will have noted that her logo is a pen-and-ink drawing of Don Quixote staring at windmills. The story of Don Quixote is the story of a man with a wild-eyed dream. What was his dream, Carla?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I am trying to remember if there was anything more than just seeing things in a very idealistic way. For instance, seeing his girlfriend, who in real life was a sort of a rough girl, as an idealized lady that had never been anything but very delicate and seeing things in their most beautiful and idealized form. I think he just wanted to right every wrong, to be a knight in shining armor. Really to be one, not just to pretend to be but to really be. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And the way he saw things was idealized to the point where everybody else said he was crazy. Actually, when that logo came to be the <i>L and L Research</i> logo, it was a little bit sideways because I had that over my desk in college. Wherever I was, whether it was before I was married it was in my room at home and after I was married it was in my one room. [Laughter] I had exactly one room to my entire apartment and I took it with me. Then through four years of a difficult marriage and then onward into single life again I had it in my apartment over my desk in the office. And Don said <i>well, tell me about that</i> and I did to the best of my ability which was pretty much what I’m telling you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It’s been so long since I read Don Quixote, I don’t remember precisely. It’s a long book. Anyway, I really liked the idea of <i>The Impossible Dream.</i> He liked the idea of seeing things and hoping for things and wanting things that maybe even weren’t there but that we were trying you know and he liked the idea of something that was called <i>Love and Light Research</i>. We were originally <i>The Love and Light Company</i> and then shortened it to <i>L and L</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">He liked the idea of that, connected with <i>Dreaming the Impossible Dream </i>so I just did a search and discovered that since Picasso had put that out over 50 some years ago that it was no longer under copyright. It was an image anybody could use and so I thought <i>groovy, “We’re going to use it,”</i> and so we have used it ever since. It’s come to be synonymous with <i>L and L Research </i>and <i>Love and Light</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But really it’s a work of some genius. Done by an artist that certainly had [Laughter] various portions of his history that were questionable but that particular drawing was simply perfection. If you look, you hardly even see where his ink - where his pen left the paper. And yet in very simple terms he conveyed that whole myth, that whole folk song, folk story that Don Quixote …<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: And I suppose the reason you identified with that is that on some level you were dreaming the impossible dream, yes?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I always knew I was dreaming impossible dreams [Laughter] and it never bothered me. In fact, I was rather proud of it. [Laughter] I thought, well why be like everybody else and just be going after fame and glory and the next seat in the corporate, you know who-ha. I really liked the idea of my being idealistic and being more on a spiritual quest and certainly Don Quixote’s quest was spiritualized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Here we go – <i>Dream the Impossible Dream.</i> [Music] I forget who that was singing. It wasn’t the normal person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: It was a diva but I don’t recognize which one … certainly a beautiful rendition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: You know, we … first of all, I have to not say <i>you know.</i> I have to watch myself [that] I do not say that. Carla, just hit me on the head if I say <i>you know</i>. [Laughter] It’s like my way of like let me delay things ‘til I think of something. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: It’s a segue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Segue, right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: ‘into what I’m going to say next, yeah.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Well, we have a lot of reiterating themes and we refer back to them often and one of the reasons we refer back to them is because some of these things are crucial and it’s hard to get it. It’s hard to get through our monkey minds to where we can integrate something and make it work for us. One of the themes is something that’s called DNA activation which has become somewhat of a buzz-word amongst many New Age people. Now I don’t believe DNA activation was talked about in the Ra material. Is that correct, Carla?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: No, it never was. No, you can’t even say there was anything remotely like it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Have you ever looked at that yourself or internalized it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I think it’s quite valid. I think it’s quite valid, I think that in-so-far as we have so many strands of DNA that are not currently being used, that there’s no question but that we have the capacity within us to get various strands of DNA that are not currently hooked up – hooked up and that that would equal being able to work with vibrations that we are not currently able to work with. I think it’s quite accurate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Did you ever hear my explanation of how it works?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Go ahead. I don’t think I have.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Well, when the Universe was first created and we had conversations, quite a few with the Elohim about that, and they were creating a microcosm to match the macrocosm and the microcosm was DNA. So DNA is like a mirror of the entire Universe. Each strand of DNA, and there are twelve (12) strands, each strand opens up a greater hologram into the Universe. And the first seven (7) strands approximately correlate to the first seven (7) chakras and the next five (5) strands correlate to expanding outside your body into the greater hologram of the Universe or however large that can be. Does that make sense? Do you follow that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: So the way a strand gets activated, and this is the trick, because when people hear this they say, “W<i>ell how do I activate my strands?</i> <i>I want to be activated</i>.” First of all, there is a handicap in this realm. The handicap is that what we could call <i>the negative</i> understands this principle very well. And they have their higher strands activated, but without compassion which essentially turns them into magicians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because they can control the Universe, to a certain degree, to their own ends and they have the idea of containing us, contracting us and keeping us in the first three strands of DNA. So that’s why the evolution of humanity has been so difficult. Because there’s an intentional programming in this realm to keep us contracted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Once you’ve taken of that programming, which everyone has for many lifetimes, probably, then you have a reality system that’s based around that program and that it’s very difficult. Something has to come and break your reality system, so that you open up to new possibilities. Because the way you evolve DNA, and this is one of those things that I’ve said before, but when I say this I know everyone’s thinking, <i>“Well, how do I do it?</i> <i>How do I get my DNA activated?</i>”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It’s a very simple process. It’s not simple necessarily to manifest but it’s simple to understand. That since your DNA is opening to holograms that are larger and larger, depending on the strand that’s activated, all you need to do is find someplace, someone, somewhere where that energy is activated at a higher hologram than you are and let that energy flow through. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now of course, this is not a one-shot deal. You can’t just go and have that experience and everything shifts because it’s more like an awakening, a flowering, a seed growing. It’s like you will always go back to your old patterns, always. And there’s going to be this process of going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth as that energy comes in. So the best ways to do this on an ongoing basis are to actually live in a situation where that energy is activated in your living situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">That would be a community, a very high-minded community or a really evolved personal relationship. A personal relationship is probably one of the fastest ways, to fast track - to do this. Because in the energy exchange with another human you have an opportunity to surface all your lower stuff because people in relationships mirror each other. They’re reflecting, and if you do it correctly the reflections get higher and higher. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You don’t get stuck in a lower reflection and if you do it at a lower level, you get stuck and you’re always blaming somebody or making the other person wrong. Of course this is sticking yourself because that person is potentially your ticket for your own evolution and you’re not manifesting it. You have to be able to switch the relationship. One of the ways to switch a relationship is to love someone the way they need to be loved. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because once you do that they’ll start loving you back the way you need to be loved. And suddenly you’re activating your fourth (4<sup>th</sup>) chakra and of course, <b>it’s the love vibration that makes this work</b>. If you look throughout history, if you start taking things apart, you can see that – this is my opinion – that behind the people that were able to greatly influence this planet was the inherent (even if they may not have had these words - they may not have even heard the word DNA) but a very deep understanding of the process, whether they understood DNA or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I mean, if you take Jesus as an example, a good example and certainly one Carla has used – you take Jesus – you have an example of a man who I believe had very high DNA activations. And that if you go large enough, you become one with whatever you’re expanding into and so if you’re at the top of the scale, the Father and you are one which is what Jesus said. And then he said, <i>when two or more are gathered, s</i>o he was creating a precedent for community. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">That as people love each other, share love, now I don’t mean mushy love, they learn how to activate themselves. That’s the greatest value of a relationship. Activating yourself and activating the other person, getting over all the mental stuff. Getting over like ‘what are we talking about stuff,’ having opinions, gossiping which is so often what things resort to. And then that energy starts to happen and that’s that experience when you walk into a room and you feel the vibe in a room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When you feel the energy in that room, it’s because the people that were in that space have learned to activate their higher chakras or their higher DNA. They were holding it and it anchored in the space. Now they didn’t do it by a technique. It’s not with technique or rituals, it just happens. It is intent that makes it occur, consistent intent over time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Those of you that listened to the few talks we did called <i>Rewriting the Old Testament</i> heard this story of the Anunnaki who were gold miners that landed on Earth and created humans. If you didn’t hear this, don’t believe it because it’s too wild. But do your own research, it’s in our archives and actually it’s got serious scholarly study behind it, indicating that this is probably true, that humans were genetically engineered, originally. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">At least one of the root races was genetically engineered by a group of descended Elohim who had gotten stuck in this realm for billions of years and called themselves the Anunnaki. We’ve talked about how the negative – how when you get into this realm, because of possessions, because of power it’s very easy to lose your sense of <i>The Law of One</i> because in this realm it’s either yours or mine. It’s either I control the energy or you do and so people compete.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When I say me and you, I don’t mean me and you, I mean one (okay?) because on these calls, this is exactly what we’re learning to go above. Survival is such a preeminent preoccupation – it has to be, it’s not wrong – it’s that the negative controls you through survival. They keep you in your lower chakras because as long as you’re worried about survival, it’s very hard to move into your heart [and] to the higher chakras.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So there’s a great advantage to having an economic disaster from the negative’s point of view. Because that fulfills their desire to keep us enslaved. There’s a great desire to keep you in fear, because if you’re in fear – as Carla said, you have to choose fear or love – it’s not so easy to choose love when you’re in survival. And this is where each of us has to become masters and disciplined so that we can be in both places at the same time. So when we hear of negative agendas and secret societies and all of that stuff, we have really, a machine that’s designed to keep us in our lower chakras. And why do they want to do that? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">There are probably a lot of reasons but one of the reasons is because they feed off our energy. And that one of the things from the Ra material was that when you have a loving space – I’ll have Carla correct me on this – when you have a loving space around you, the negative can’t through it. It bounces off. So when you finally build your energy up to where you can hold that space, the negative loses its control over you … its ability to control you, its ability to create fear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You have even overcome the fear of death and in which case what do they have to hold over you? But Carla, did I get that right? You want to clarify that one?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: That’s close enough. Go right ahead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Close enough, yeah. So there’s a field that you create where the negative can’t get through and then you are free from the encumbrances of this realm. Otherwise, as most of you have experienced, this realm is filled with traps, hooks. Ways to get you sucked in and in ways that once you’re sucked in, you can’t get out of. Now as I have been studying this Anunnaki episode on the creation of humans, there was kind of a division between two points of view - these two brothers Enki and Enlil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Where Enlil wanted to control everything or kill all the humans and Enki wanted to evolve them. Now one thing about the Universe is that nothing is destroyed. Everything exists and it continues to exist in whatever form it is. Which could be a soul on the other side, it could be a soul stuck in the astral, it could be you and I but we don’t go away. We continue but our bodies go away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And on the Enki side of the evolutionary scale, it seems to me there’s a little bit from Enki of also turning the world into a playground and you know having … Well, one of the ways of raising DNA is through intimacy and intimacy is - again, you still have to learn in intimacy how to hold it yourself. Otherwise if the person leaves you or the person dies … what you learn through intimacy is through the person. Each person has their expansion into a hologram and in the best relationships you have two people that have different expansions into different areas of the Universe hologram and when they come together and they have intimacy, their energies become one. So they both have access to the energies of the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When there’s a lot of cooperation going on, that creates a lot of power. It creates a lot of joy. It creates fulfillment and it activates the DNA. And as you’re involved in this relationship you are learning how to expand into this new holographic area that you were not formally connected with. And after awhile you have incorporated it. So the person is not quite as important as they were to keeping you in balance. That doesn’t mean you have to separate, it means that the relationship gets better. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because when you’re desperately clinging to another person’s energy to keep yourself in balance, the word for that is: codependent. And usually each person’s sense of independence and wanting to be free will be, partially - what’s the word? – partially fighting against that, fighting against the codependency aspect because no one wants to be dependent on another person. Or I won’t say no one wants to, some people do want to. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But nonetheless, ultimately the codependency has to grow into co-creation in which case this unit, this couple, suddenly is empowered. They can create things at a very high level because they’re not codependent. In the codependency aspect of it there’s always fear and fear is that if the person leaves me I will be devastated, I won’t be able to continue because that person is making me feel good. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So the fear often times will create what it’s afraid of <span style="color: #0070c0;">– </span>making people separate. So what we’re doing is we’re in a school and the school is learning how to expand our hologram and being involved in situations, people, groups, whatever that stimulate our energies so that we learn about things that we don’t have inside us or outside us. We haven’t had that piece of the puzzle and then we come together and we inter-mingle energies and then we learn from other people’s energies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We learn new ways of under … not even understanding, this is not mental. This is, again, community, intimacy, and of course even (co-creating) with God and even with the higher realms, moving from codependency to co-creativity. What is it like to be codependent on the higher realms? It means I am nothing, God is everything. It means doing God’s will. It means there’s some intelligence up there that you have to please and you know what, that’s not co-creation. That’s like fear of doing something wrong. You know there were god’s in the Old Testament that we talked about that were not the highest God’s but lower gods that thrived on that particular aspect of their relationship with people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because they could keep you in fear, they could keep you attendant and you would give them your energy. The problem with that kind of relationship, the problem with that when it’s not co-creative but it is codependent, is that despite everyone’s best intent to try to make a codependent relationship work, it’s a closed loop and the energy doesn’t sustain. So it creates then, anger. Why is that person not giving me what I want?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">They used to make me feel good, now they don’t, they’re denying me. You think they’re denying you because they can choose it. The fact of the matter is they can’t choose it because the energy left. This is why that famous saying by - I forget the name of the guy who wrote <i>The Little Prince – </i>said, <i>a relationship is not just looking at each other, it’s looking in the same direction</i>. Looking in the same direction moves something from codependency to co-creation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When you’re in codependency, what happens is you are giving energy to each other that is going to die. The energy is not going to sustain and then often time people think the person’s denying them, there must be somebody better out there and they go looking for somebody better. And again, in the beginning stage of the relationship, because there are no rules and the energy’s really high, people can have a very high interchange. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But usually within six month’s – a year – after that runs out, they’re back in co-dependency or they’re back in no energy where they just have a formal kind of relationship, working things out. Like out of security, the guy works, the woman brings up the kids. Now when you have children it is a common purpose. But the whole point of all of this is how do <i>you</i> move into the situations where you can have the highest DNA activation?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It creates finding circumstances where you’re in co-creative loving connections. Now I know on this call that there’s energy coming in on this call that, for those of you that are taking them in, are helping to activate your DNA. This is a community and this is a grouping of energies where we are all sharing energies in a free way and there are no control systems here. That’s why we can keep coming into these calls and the energy keeps coming present because each call starts with chaos, it doesn’t start with any control mechanisms. If you hear me at the beginning of the call, I’m saying to myself, <i>maybe I won’t have anything to talk about today. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">U</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">sually there’s no planning and it is seat of the pants but you know what? The energy comes in all the time and you’re part of that energy. You’re part of the creation of that energy. We’re part of healing each other and doing calls like this was my way of solving this impossible situation of having to travel everywhere and then leave and usually people can’t sustain the energies. So this gives everyone who is participating an ongoing opportunity to sit in these energies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But there’s still the need to create it out of your own creation, okay? I may be creating this – we’re all creating it – but I’m creating the venue, okay and we’re all creating the energy and ultimately, what’s your venue? It’s got to be totally unique to you, it has to be authentic. You don’t have to do this in this way but you do have to look for ways to get that energy into your life on a regular basis so that you can activate your DNA. In particular, there is a distinct connection between DNA activation and graduating this realm, as I see it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because if we look at the Ra material, the Ra material said 51% dedication to service is what gets you out of this realm. In some of our material it said having your heart chakra open slightly more than half or 51% gets you out of this realm. Well when you’re dedicated to service, your heart chakra has to open and that is why service works. It’s one way of looking at it – to the other. It is service and keeping your heart chakra open - are two sides of the same coin. Each of us has our own personal challenge on an ongoing basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now, I was talking about the Anunnaki and this … now we talk about the Anunnaki and we realized that was the most recent indication - intervention with them was like fifteen (15) thousand years ago. And we think well, that was then and this is now except it’s not then and now. Because then we start looking through history and say how did these guys manifest? What did they do throughout history? How did it work? Did they reincarnate as humans? Were they working on the other side? Because we learned - we asked this question last Wednesday - that in the creation of humans there was a certain karma that they took on and that was to evolve humans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And if you look at the two sides – the one side – the negative side was kind of not on an evolutionary path. It was trying to freeze <span style="color: #0070c0;">the</span> circumstance so they could always be on top. That means they’re enslaved by the people they enslave, because it takes work to keep slaves. If you want to become free, you have to move from slavery into co-creation. In co-creation you don’t have to work to keep someone hooked. In slavery you’ve got to keep someone hooked over many lifetimes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So there’s the one group that is just locking themselves into this enslaved reflection back and forth between those that they enslave and themselves who are being enslaved. Of course they are wanting to be enslaved but it’s a high level of enslavement. It doesn’t look like they’re enslaved, it looks like they’re bossing everything around and they’re in control. But from my way of looking at it – they’re enslaved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Then you have the group that wanted to evolve humans, that wanted to move through this and that took on a certain karmic responsibility for the evolution of humans. And that throughout history … and this is stuff I can’t validate but as I was looking through all the materials, it makes sense. There was Enki and there was Inanna. Enki changed his name to P’taah or his name changed or actually P’taah was part of this energy – it’s connected with the word P’taah and that P’taah was in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> and working with people as a priest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And then another time Enki ended up in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and became responsible for yoga. Of course yoga – what does yoga have? It has a way of evolving your DNA. It’s a way of meeting in groups. It’s a way of moving energy, moving kundalini. And then Inanna became the goddess of the divine feminine and ended up in different places creating tantric yoga, using sexual interchange as a way of helping to expand DNA evolution in people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And of course many, many churches and religions have great prohibitions against sex. Now this is not a call to have wild sex (how would I say it?) in an unbridled way. But loving sex evolves your DNA, fast. And one of the reasons there’s prohibitions to sex is it’s such a difficult thing and people get in trouble there. They go into betrayal, they do all kinds of things that do just the opposite of what it could do. But the other reason is because when people have shut down their second chakra (creation/sex), usually their third chakra (solar plexus/power) is shut down as well, to a certain degree and that means they’re easy to control and they become followers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">They’re not self-empowered and so organizations that want followers and want donations create circumstances where people feel guilty about opening those energies up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">On that note it’s 11:00 a.m. and I think I’m going to just see if Carla and Terry have anything they’d like to share on this whole thing that I just talked about. And we’ll start our visualization. Carla?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I guess the only thing that I have to share is that I’ve been on that Homecoming and I’m very high on it and we make sure we have it every year. And the reason is that it lifts everybody. Everybody helps everybody to get lifted up and everyone can experience for themselves what it’s like to be in that higher vibration and can get the feeling of what it’s like and knows what it feels like. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Once you have a taste for it you don’t really want to go back and if you can remember it well enough, you can go back there all by yourself just by remembering. So hopefully that’s what we give people at Homecoming, is that environment for growth, that hotbed for spiritual growth that is such a precious thing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: So in the context of what we’re talking about …<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: In the context of what you’re talking about we are activating DNA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: You’re activating DNA even though you don’t use that vocabulary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: But you know activating DNA is fun and loving and empowering, you know? It’s not something to go around … if you see someone that’s selling DNA activations [Laughter] look really carefully because they give this illusion that you can see them one time and everything shifts. Now maybe it will. If you find that person let me know because I’d like to find them, too. But in general, it’s an easy way to create a momentary experience and charge you a lot of money and then they don’t care anymore after they have your money. That’s one of the ways to tell somebody who is truly working from the higher realms, is that they’re not just there for you because you pay them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">They’re there, you feel their presence - they’re with you. You don’t feel like an object that when you pay them you get to use their services. Not that you shouldn’t pay somebody, it’s okay to pay somebody. And in fact, by the way, we need money right now so if anyone wants to click the donate button on the email today, feel free to do it. But make it a free will choice to support that which is supporting you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We’ve chosen to support you and we’re doing it and when you make a donation you’re making the choice to support us back. And not only is it supporting us back, but it’s enhancing the synergy of the relationship, building the synergy of it from your point of view. So it all becomes co-creative. And Terry is our silent anchor in the back … [Laughter]<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Hello.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Did you miss out on wanting to say anything?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Well I was just thinking about the relationship … I was trying to get a definition of DNA. And like what it indicates on the Internet in one of the main sites is that DNA is found inside the area of the cell called the nucleus. It’s very small and it is packaged – this DNA is packaged together. It has different organisms, many DNA molecules and it’s packaged inside the cell and something that’s called the chromosome. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And then it gives instructions to make proteins and these proteins turn out to be genes and they give instructions to the body. Like how to build the body and whether it’s to have blue eyes or brown eyes. Whether it’s to be an elephant or whether it’s to be a human. So that’s sort of how it all ties together with the DNA. And if you have a preconceived idea about yourself, say, that you are not worthy, you’re bathing the whole genome, the whole DNA of all of your cells in that feeling – in that belief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And that it’s inhibiting the interactions within the cells and it’s giving a mixed signal to the instructions. I should exist and I should go forward and I should be all that I can be and then comes the idea that you are not worthy and then it’s inhibiting the instructions to the DNA and to the body functions. And it’s inhibiting the grease that makes the body flow and work together harmoniously and, it’s a limiting factor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So activation would be enabling the body to go forward with the maximum amount and top instructions that the body can utilize to be the best one can be and to be who one really is, because they’re working together with the DNA and the whole body. That’s my comment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Well thank you. <b>And a lot of this unworthiness is actually programmed into this realm by the negative because if they keep people feeling unworthy, they keep you from activating your DNA</b>. And the biggest fear of the negative, in my opinion - they didn’t tell me this (but their biggest fear) I’ve read this – is that humans will activate their DNA to much greater potentials and that then they become equal and superior to the negative; that we have those potentials. And that no external force can do this for you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When you hear things like <i>the whole planet’s going to shift and everyone’s going to upgrade</i>, I personally think that the wording should be ‘everyone has the opportunity to upgrade’ not that everyone’s going to be upgraded. Because if everyone was upgraded, that would violate peoples free will. It would be happening <i>to</i> them, they were not part of it. And each of you is an intrinsic part of your own evolution, by your choices, by your actions, by your increases in wisdoms and understandings of how things work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: One thing that I’ve noticed is in doing readings for people, some of the people with the highest intuitive skills, the most psychic, the most brilliant, the most connected are under actual negative attack that knocks them back down so that even though they’re totally brilliant and <i>amazing</i> people that they don’t have - the fire - I mean they have a resistance to being all they can be because of the negative attack keeps knocking them back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Carla’s the best example, I think [Laughter] when she was doing the Ra material. They did <i>everything</i> they could to make her not want to do it. Am I right Carla?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Well short of hitting me over the head with a 2 by 4, yes you are definitely right. [Laughter]<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yeah, I mean to the point where she almost died. Because that kind of material and the kind of material we’re doing is giving people the keys to the whole process! And it’s taking the power away from those external forces that want to give you keys. They want to control you so that you give your energy back to them now that you’re in slavery. So each of us has the wherewithal, the tapping into the passion, the intent and that creates the thrust to overcome this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because as you start going on this path, almost invariably you will get increased negative attacks trying to back you down. And this is the best way to look at that, because I have to go through this for sure – the best way to look at that is realizing those negative attacks, sometimes, are just obstacles. Like <i>no one loves me, all the doors are being shut</i>, however it looks those obstacles are actually your barbells – are getting more weight on them so you can be stronger. It’s an initiation to get strong enough to go through that. Because when you master it, it stops! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It doesn’t continue and you have the power in you to master it. You have the power to go through it and you have to desire it with all your heart and soul. You know it’s like that famous movie about the television guy, <i>I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore! </i>&nbsp;So you have to be prepared for that. Now not everyone has that, some people come in from really (really) angelic realms and they don’t have that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But usually those people, usually, they’re not able to go out and be the highest warriors in this realm because they need everything purified and they create lives where they don’t have to deal with it. They go into monasteries, they go into ashrams. There’s nothing wrong with that, just it’s a way of holding group energy that keeps one out of negative valances, in many cases, unless the ashram is under the negative valance or whatever which is certainly possible. But in any case, let’s move on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Can I say one thing here?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: One of the things with me is I have worked really hard on myself to find any sources of negativity and to get to the basic cause of it, the basic source of it. And I have gotten to the source of a lot of different avenues where negativity can come in. It’s from surroundings, from the different people [that] may be jealous, or actual physical beings, or it’s from programming that I’ve had in this life or last life, or many, many lives ago where actual programming has been done - on people in general - to knock them down so that when they think: <i>I’m great,</i> then all of a sudden they think: <i>I’m not great</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And to bring the opposite in and maybe the thought was to keep them balanced in the middle of everything but it tends to make a yo-yo where it’s like they think of a good aspect and then immediately think of a bad aspect. Like I can, I can – I can’t, no I can’t. I can, I can’t, I can, I can’t. I might, I should, I won’t. [Laughter] And the mind gets going in circuitries but it’s been trained that way and a person can, if they start to notice that, can let it go on by and eventually deprogram them self. So there is stuff coming perhaps from outside or stuff coming from negative programming from the past. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But yet there’s another source of negativity that can come in right in present time and that can be from electronic current in real time - programming aimed to the individual when it’s realized by a group that is people-have<span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span>special qualities. And that they are going to take a whole section of society with them and make that whole section of society more aware. And then electronic devices are aimed at them, unknown to them, to confuse them and to make them more unaware. So that every case is different and has its own thing but there’s some general categories like this that I’ve noticed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: They can even program thoughts in the ethers, right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yes. They can program … like they’re project - I think it’s called Blue Beam, project Blue Beam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yeah.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I did some investigation just to see – you know to try and tune in to it, to see what was going on, and I got those green image pictures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Um hum. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Then I didn’t even know what it was and then I went on the Internet and I checked and they had some of those pictures like I’d been seeing when I was investigating it and that they can aim at people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Um hum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: And they can probably even get a person’s electronic signature and take a picture of it and put it in a databank that they can then search through the databank and compare and locate the individual by the electronic signature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: So this whole negative overlay is very sophisticated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: In fact, at one point I was looking up all kinds of people that channel and trying to figure out what’s going on, about five-six years ago, trying to learn about what people are saying and where it’s coming from. And there’s people all over our planet that are getting channeled messages about a fleet of spaceships that’s standing in space waiting to save humanity. Millions of spaceships, our space brothers they’re called and they came under the name Ashtar Command. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When I did a session on it with Terry … and of course we could be wrong and they could be right. When it comes to asking a question that you can’t validate, it doesn’t mean they’re right. But the answer that came through was there was this giant organic computer somewhere out there that was able to interface with the psyches of certain humans and transmit messages to them and that Ashtar Command was a whole thing that was based on these projected messages from this organic computer, okay?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And I know, particularly, in various certain churches that people are getting channeled messages from the negative. So it’s very tricky about giving up your power to anything outside of yourself and thinking I’m going to follow that. You know I endeavor, in our calls and on these things we do, to always have it a co-creative energy and there’s really nothing to follow. There’s just some wisdom here and there’s some new understandings and things that you can incorporate because the goal is for you to empower yourself and have the tools and the keys to do that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And, I just got some emails … hello to Siija Hill in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>; hello to Ben Townsend who sent me an email that said <i>you lived in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Berkeley</st1:place></st1:city> when I lived in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Berkeley</st1:place></st1:city></i>. Hi Ben, maybe we met on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Telegraph Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, if you’re listening. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Let’s go into this connection with the greater Universe</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> and let’s think about our DNA as we do it. Think about this energy flowing through you on a cellular level, on a micro-level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We see the energy of the Earth – everything in the Universe is one-energy and in the highest truth, we are never separated from that energy. We are never separated from <i>All That Is</i>. <b>We are never separated from each other and separation is an illusion that we experience in order to have a body</b>. And everything that exists has an energy field attached to it, everything. Everything in the Universe - from a rock, to a cat, to you, to the Earth and the physical manifestation is always discreet. It is separate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It’s an illusion of separateness because just on top of the physical manifestation are the energies and the energies do not have to be separate, they can connect. The key is to be living in a discreet body and to be able to tune into the energies of connection. So we see the energy of the Earth coming up through the floor and into our feet. Now our feet are flat on the ground or the bed or wherever, parallel to the Earth and we just see the rays of energy coming up into our feet from the Earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We know the Earth is there and the Earth knows we know, so we can say hello to the Earth. We can say <i>I love you Earth …</i> and you notice when you say <i>I love you Earth</i> there’s a little boost of energy. And we move that energy up through our legs, through our calves, through our thighs, through our genitals, through our solar plexus, through our chest, through our neck and into the top of our head. And notice how that feels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We move through the top of our heads into the space above our heads, up to the ceiling, through the ceiling and through the roof (and if there’s any rooms above you then move right through those rooms and up through the roof) into the sky. We are directing our energy - we are moving our energy through space and through time. We’re moving it through all of our past lives, we’re resetting ourselves and we come to the place where we are connected. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Each of us has a track through time and as we go back on that track, we find the place where we first separated our energies from <i>All That Is</i> and became individuated. We are innocent there but we have no experience. As we all move to that space, we can affiliate with each other in our innocence. We can touch each other. We can blend our energies. We can connect. We can experience family … where we can invite our Sources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">They’re not really our Sources - I call them our Sources - we can invite those higher aspects of ourselves: all those energies that we call the Ra Group, the Elohim Group. Keep in mind that everything I’m saying for us is also true for them. At one point they were not individuated – at one point they became individuated. In the Ra Group they went through a series of lifetimes in this realm and the Elohim Group, they didn’t. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Or the one’s that did were no longer part of that group in that way but they had an affiliation. But as we move into that moment of individuation there’s a kind of equality that occurs amongst us all. So we invite them to join that moment of first cause, of first individuation and we are becoming one. We are one with <i>All That Is</i> and you can feel that tingling in your body. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You can feel that sense of connection and if we apply what I said earlier, you could assume that right now you’re in a state of DNA activation. And we can move that energy back down. We can go from that place of oneness, through all the realms, through all the timelines, through all the past lives and as it moves through it is a pure energy and as a group let us see our energy fields being healed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The Elohim has talked about a very high group of Elohim called <i>Grace</i> and we’re asking for Grace to be part of this group now. Because Grace is at the first point of creation and we want to move that energy of Grace through our track, through our lives and grease it all - create a flow, a healing of the traumas, the anguishes, the hurts that have been imposed on us, to create that forgiveness of the things that we have done that has created judgment on our self. We move through that entire track right back to your present physical embodiment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We bring the energy in through the top of your head as it comes through your roof, through your ceiling and we’re going to move it slowly through our body and as it moves through to free up any blocked energy, any pain, any hurt. As we move this energy through us, we can imagine our DNA - our chakras are unfolding, opening and move it where you feel blocked. Most of us have blocks on our heart chakra (4<sup>th</sup> chakra). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Move it focused right in your chest, in your heart chakra and let go of anything you’re holding in your heart that is contracting your heart. Let go of the people in your memory bank that have hurt you. Bring in the quality of forgiveness. Let go of the judgments of yourself, the things you’ve done to hurt others. You know in Christianity they have this idea of being reborn in Christ. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When you experience this moment as being the first moment of creation, there is no past, you’re creating the future from this place. I believe that’s what it means to be reborn in Christ. It means forgiven for your sins - means letting this energy of spirit move you back to your innocence and releasing all those traumas, all those hurts, all those things we’ve done to hurt other people that are in our track and right now, let them go. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Let the most pure spirit of love move through you. Let’s go through, while we’re in this space, using our group energy – remember our group energy is very big because we’re including Elohim Group, we’re including Ra Group, we’re including all of us, we’re including all those angelic forces that are positive, service-to-others that would choose to be in this energetic space with us right now. We know you’re there; thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And we have <b>Debby in South Blooming Grove, New York</b> who sends healing love and protection to all the beings on the planet, especially our brothers and sisters in the ocean. Especially include the dolphins and the whales that are being affected by the changes that are taking place on the planet at this time. And Debby also says continued healing, love and protection to her daughter Possum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And then we have here <b>Pat in Birmingham, Alabama</b> keeping her older daughter in the light and ease the physical pain her mother is experiencing during her transition. Let’s just send this light energy around Pat’s mother and she puts the wisdom of Wynn in the light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And then we have <b>Lisa in Washington</b> – assistance in finding appropriate work and financial support; healing for her mother and her sister as well as healing for the planet. Thank you and wishing many blessings to all. And Lisa, remember when you are out looking, somebody is looking for you and keep going until you find that person or that group or that job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Marsha in Panorama City</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> is under attacks from her neighbors. Somebody slashed her tires.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And <b>Zoe in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sacramento</st1:place></st1:city></b> – please heal my cracked tooth. By the way, if you ever have a toothache (this is Wynn giving a side comment) a really good way to immediately stop your toothache is start chewing ginger on the tooth that’s aching. The ginger juice kills the germs and makes it go away. Terry and I have both used that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Also, love and light to Bob Gibson’s girls whose mother has passed over. And love and light to take charge of the publishing and distribution of the writing I am publishing online for the highest good of all concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And then <b>Lys in Rimrock, Arizona</b> – protection and healing for the entire world for damage that’s already been done from chemtrails and electromagnetic energies used to do weather modification. And she asks for protection and healing for herself and her daughter, it’s been a difficult couple of weeks. Let’s just send light around <st1:place w:st="on">Lys</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And we have one more here. We have <b>Michael in Chicago</b> – healing for Joseph </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Pyrzynski</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:city> for his drug addiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Rick in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iowa City</st1:place></st1:city></span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> – his brother-in-law Mike has severe bone cancer and lots of pain. Put him in the light for healing, comfort and answers. Thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Okay, we’re just going to get a message from our Sources through Terry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Father Mother God we ask for the presence of the Light to surround</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> and protect each person on this line and everyone listening to these calls for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the outer energy fields of the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet Earth, through our bodies and into the center of the Earth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And right now we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls and we invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring <i>The Law of One</i> to join with us and we create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave <i>now</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Ra’An/Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: We greet you in the Love Light of <i>The One Infinite Creator</i>. This is <st1:date month="9" day="15" year="2013" w:st="on">the 15<sup>th</sup> of September 2013</st1:date> and we take a moment and we adjust to the frequencies of the 3<sup>rd</sup> density. We are a group soul, Ra’An. We are an aspect of the Elohim connected with an aspect of the Ra Group. And, we are also connected with the aspect of the Elohim <i>Grace</i> today. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And by virtue of the fact of us being a group soul, we are able to hold the energies of the manifest world and to move as a group within the manifest world and to remote view, to travel to the aspects of the Earth plane in which you have put into the Light and are able to move, to touch, to be with each and every person who wishes connection. And we provide a source of support, an energetic support that you can triangulate with. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">If, for instance, you have on your Team Shift call more than one person, then it makes it easy to triangulate with us. When there are two that are gathered and would triangulate with us, then you can hold the support that we offer as we do not interfere. We do not interact unless it is you yourself that desire it. So do not be afraid to ask. When it is that you desire something as the ones that have put your names on the healing list today, and we include in that everyone who has asked silently or secretly without even knowing they have asked, are asking/are desiring, for desire is a basis of asking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It is creation of an-energy, of a magnetic light<span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span>that lets the Universe know to bring what it is that is needed for the sustenance, for the support. And it is important that you yourself know your worth because in knowing your worth you can open your own self to give and to receive. If you feel that you are not worthy of support or receiving then you will block the entrance of that support to you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And your whole system is composite multiple cells that all get the signal and all act in harmony and unison. So when you know that you are a worthy good person, it opens up the ability for you to open up and activate your chakras and to give and receive. And it is through connection that you can grow. It is through getting out of your own box that you can know that you are a part of all, a part of whatever it is you desire to move into and to be a part of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We are cognizant of the things individuals have put into the Light and we send Love Light for strength to Marsha and to Jim. And we send Love Light to Possum. And we hear the call from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Fremont</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">California</st1:state></st1:place> and the humming sounds coming from above and getting louder. Are they real? These sounds are low frequency waves that are real and are at a frequency that the human being is operating at. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Therefore they can disturb sleep and can get on your wavelength and hijack your consciousness as you ride on their wave of the low frequency hum. When an individual lives in an area that has a solid foundation, for instance, a stone base – this can amplify the hum. We suggest seeing if when you may travel to a different area, a different geological formation, if the hum becomes less. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It is a man-made hum that is part of a low frequency system of communication that is part of a system submarines communications and other communication operates on. So it is real. Play with it a bit and see if there are other areas if you stay overnight, if you do not hear that hum so loudly. We take a look at the other things people have put into the Light. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We send opportunity to those looking for a job. We see that there is opportunity, that there is something specifically for you that you can do and feel good about and then also good about the financing that you are bringing in. We send this for money and resources to Susan. We thank you for this opportunity to be with you and we Love you. This is a sacred moment and we are honored to be in contact with each and every one of you. Thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I have a quick question. The question is: as a person anchors their frequencies in the higher realms, as a person activates their DNA strands, do they become more immune to these external frequencies that are attempting to impact their consciousness?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Ra’An/Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: It is where a person is focusing. If a person focuses on the hum for instance, then they bring their whole body range into the frequency of the hum and it is harder to move out of it. If they change their attention and their focus to another area they can perhaps have the hum move into the distance within their own psyche so that it is no longer affecting them. The more aggravated by something one is, the more their attention and all of their focus goes to it and the more it aggravates them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Thank you. You know what, we have taken a long time and next week I promise I am going to focus – I’m going to cut my talk to half an hour and focus on the activation part of this call. And we very quickly hold our group energy together and we become co-creators with the Universe and we surround our planet with this energy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We are the gateways, we are the links surrounding our planet and impacting moving down through the planetary fields and impacting everything on this planet that is reaching for spirit. We ask for protection from earthquakes, from negative influences. We ask for awareness for the populations. We ask for the quality of discernment for ourselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We ask for the ability to hold no matter what happens around us. We ask for the courage to stand up against all of those things that would pull us down. We ask for the blessings of spirit of the highest realms for our homes, for our health, for our families, for those people that care about us and those people that we care about. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It’s 11:59 a.m. We have to close and we bless you all and we’ll see you next time. Tomorrow we have Joel (Terry) in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:city> is going to interview Gijs on our call. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And we’ll do this every so often, interviewing people who are contributing to our work or who have their own way of contributing to the world - on Mondays. So on that note, I thank Carla, Terry and Gijs and all of you for being here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
