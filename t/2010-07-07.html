<p>Transcription<br /> Wednesday July 7th 2010- Ques and Answers from the Ra'An<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: This is Wednesday, July 7th and I welcome all of you on the line<br /> and I welcome all those of you on the reply line. This is Wynn Free.<br /> We are doing what I call, a question and answer session with our<br /> sources with whom I have communicated with for eight years now. They<br /> don't talk to me directly but they talk to me through people that I<br /> have had personal relationships with and one of those is on the line.<br /> We have had extremely interesting experiences and information brought<br /> forth on these calls. It is a view of information from what I call<br /> celestial realms that is not normally available to people. On this<br /> call you submit questions and I ask them. First we will call in the<br /> light.<br /> <br /> <br /> (Wynn calls in the light)<br /> <br /> <br /> On that note I will open this up for them to greet us and we will ask<br /> some questions for tonight.<br /> <br /> <br /> Ra'An: We greet you in the love-light of the One Infinite Creator. We<br /> are delighted to be with you this day; this July 7th, 2010, focused<br /> through Terry Brown in Sedona, Arizona and as we focus in, we note the<br /> change from Los Angeles to Sedona in the nature environment of Sedona<br /> with the friendly shrubs and trees and we expand and connect with each<br /> and every individual and with and every individual's situation as they<br /> are on this line or as they listen to this call later. We are<br /> available to answer prayers usually when one tries to connect with our<br /> realm the high frequency, All That Is realm, they do not realize that<br /> there is an intelligence there, that is sensing, understanding,<br /> comprehending their situation. We wish to let you know that we are<br /> there and comprehending and we are available to take questions. Do you<br /> have questions?<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: Yes we do. Now this first question, I will read it like it was<br /> sent to me. The questions reads like this. I would like to know the<br /> best practice of how to rid one's past life regressions and come into<br /> one's astral body but what I think he meant is how does one rid<br /> oneself of the influence of one's past lives and come into the present<br /> and not be controlled by all of those old energies. I think that is<br /> what he meant.<br /> <br /> <br /> Ra'An: It has been said and it's so true that the only place of power<br /> is in the Now. We give a minute for that to sink in. When one has a<br /> traumatic incident; an unjust incident that they feel in the time,<br /> whatever time it happened, must be resolved, that they must be heard,<br /> that this injustice must be corrected, then this injustice is<br /> diametrically opposed to what has happened and it hangs in time and<br /> carries forward with the individual and it bottles up their attention<br /> units as they are still seeking to get the injustice righted in the<br /> present. It skews and distorts their view of the present as they are<br /> taking to some degree the account of this past injustice into the<br /> present time. When one observes their own behavior they may note when<br /> they are doing that they may have pains within their body that are not<br /> corroborated with anything that has happened in this lifetime. This<br /> can hang up and be a thorn in their side in this lifetime now. One can<br /> observe themselves when they feel not fully present or they are not<br /> tracking with the current situation and they can ask themselves: Do my<br /> thoughts, my orientation match with what is coming to me in the<br /> present. It can be triggered by some physical object that reminds one<br /> of the past trauma. One can observe. It can be triggered by a<br /> location. One can take hold of themselves when they feel that they are<br /> not totally tracking with the present and compare this with the<br /> present and the signals coming in from the present, in other words,<br /> they are getting a signal from some past event that is taking up their<br /> attention. They can reset themselves, perhaps getting a massage,<br /> although this may not be permanent, and reset their attention, moving<br /> into something that gets their attention and moves them out of that<br /> zone. One in observing can let this bleed off, can forgive when they<br /> see this happening. One can disconnect it from the present and forgive<br /> anything they may have done or something someone else has done so they<br /> are not sitting in the full effect of that, still begging the other<br /> person to be just or to correct the injustice. This is some of the<br /> things one may do. One may see little flashes come in, in connection<br /> with some earlier instance and it may become more and more clear.<br /> Often when they have seen the roots of the instance they can let it go<br /> and be free of it and walk in present time.<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: Thank you.<br /> You know, if you don't mind, I want to take a moment and share my own<br /> experience of something that happened to me years ago that related to<br /> this question of a past life. I had a reading thirty years ago from<br /> someone who explained to me of a past life I had lived as a troubadour<br /> in England, a thousand years ago and I would go from town to town and<br /> I eventually had an untimely death from a guy that poisoned me, who<br /> was as an innkeeper and they told me that that innkeeper was my father<br /> in this lifetime and because he had killed me, that I had the option<br /> of having a life through him. When I was young I felt like my father<br /> did not want me around and I was never good enough. I didn't<br /> understand why that was so until I realized that he had killed me and<br /> thought that he had gotten rid of me and here I was again and part of<br /> him was still killing me and that he had left me with many feelings of<br /> unworthiness and not being good enough and I didn't understand where<br /> those feelings came from and when I had this reading and understood<br /> this past life I knew it had to be true, there were so many<br /> correlations. We were duplicating patterns like one time in this<br /> lifetime he forced me to eat something I didn't want to eat and he<br /> actually pushed it down my throat and it was all very traumatic for<br /> me. When I had the reading it didn't clear it for me, the energy of<br /> unworthiness, but I realized that one of the first things I had to do<br /> was to forgive my father on a very deep level so I started that<br /> process. I also had to understand that my feelings of unworthiness, my<br /> feelings of not being good enough was something that was implanted in<br /> me and it wasn't really true so I got to observe those feelings and<br /> every time I had those feelings I would say to myself. Ok, that's not<br /> me, this is something in my track, I am making it up from my past and<br /> I had to work on myself for a couple of years to make a major<br /> improvement in this energy and I am sure that many people who are<br /> listening to this may have incidents like that. Sometimes even if you<br /> don't know what the past life was or the specific incident you can<br /> look for patterns that don't seem to make sense like why do I feel<br /> this way, why do I not like this person, why do my parents treat me<br /> this way and you might tap into your own intuitions and start clearing<br /> it. Regardless if you know the past life or not if you start to<br /> observe the patterns and thought forms that sabotage you and when they<br /> come up recognize them and put another thought on top of it. Like you<br /> think I'm no good, I'm not worthy, and then think I am worthy, even<br /> when you don't believe it, or I'm sick, I'm well. Those are the things<br /> that I did and over a period of time I made huge advances in those<br /> patterns.<br /> <br /> <br /> The next question is almost like the first, but I will ask it because<br /> maybe there is some additional information and of course our sources<br /> can comment on what I have said as well. This comes from Zoyie and she<br /> said, she's read that the human mind carries in it unresolved past<br /> traumas, personal as well as those shared by the race. I know I've<br /> read that that there have been epic horrible mass destructions at<br /> different times in the history of our universe and that some of us<br /> were there, and we got into terrible fear and terrible oppression and<br /> that a whole race was destroyed or exterminated or some natural<br /> disaster, but something that created a huge amount of fear. So the<br /> question is please comment on how we can clear these traumas so that<br /> more love-light can reach more people more quickly.<br /> <br /> <br /> Ra'An: Thank you. One of the situations that occurs is, that planet<br /> earth goes through different situations and the population experiences<br /> some diminishing of the population in certain areas and the traumas<br /> which are then encoded in the Akashic Records of time and at these<br /> times there is a certain configuration of the stars, a configuration<br /> of the moon, of the solar system, of the planetary projections and<br /> their spherical rotations so that in a future time, the planet which<br /> is carrying in it's memory, as all is conscious at some degree, at<br /> some frequency, and all has intelligences, although they may be<br /> encoded in stone, when these configurations occur, it reminds the<br /> subconscious and the lower consciousness of the area of the original<br /> event and should there be humans around that had experienced that, it<br /> also can trigger this, and then emblazon new and resonate traumas upon<br /> the earth in certain locations at the time as it brings up, burping<br /> up, and experiencing those traumas and engaging the earth in earth<br /> changes. Some of this has to do with the changes of the pole of the<br /> planetary conjunctions in the neighborhood. This is true of<br /> individuals as it was mentioned in the previous answer to the<br /> question, as the individuals encounter a similar circumstance which<br /> caused the original trauma, and the individual at a subconscious level<br /> is reminded of the original trauma and begins to reorient his matrix<br /> to the time and place of the original trauma and then is thrown out of<br /> present time and into the past. These similar things happen to<br /> consensus reality and to the consciousness of the lower minerals and<br /> lower frequency consciousness that comprises earth and they then can<br /> recapitulate and bring forth similar events and circumstances upon the<br /> area or the people located in the area. There are times we are moving<br /> into where some of these events are bringing negative effects on some<br /> of the areas of the earth at this time. In the area of the gulf of<br /> Mexico which dates back to geological time wherein geology was fixed<br /> in a certain position and now it is moving into a position where it<br /> can move.<br /> <br /> <br /> Also in earthquake fault lines where previous events occurred and now<br /> are emerging as a possibility in the future. One of the purposes for<br /> this group and the people getting together in this group is to bring<br /> forth love-light for past events into the consciousness of the people<br /> and re-establishing of the higher frequencies which the individuals<br /> tend to leave behind when they get connected to the earth. The earth<br /> itself is disconnected to some greater degree from these higher<br /> frequencies and can be reconnected by the work that you and I and<br /> everyone on the line and everyone who comes in contact with this are<br /> doing, and by you and I, we mean the Elohim group and the Ra group and<br /> there are other group souls too, working to bring love-light into the<br /> earth plane so it may recognize it's origins and to bless the past and<br /> dissolve the past and its effect upon future events.<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: Thank you.<br /> Next question. Are the people of BP getting karma for their gulf oil spill?<br /> <br /> <br /> Ra'An: The people from BP, and we do not include all the people at BP,<br /> but certain individuals at BP who have made certain hasty expedient<br /> decisions, who are desirous of saving money and pleasing the people at<br /> the higher es halons and putting inexperienced people to run the deep<br /> water drilling rig who had would not listen to any more experienced<br /> individuals, they are practically going unconscious and with the<br /> consequences they are experiencing, there are others who could foresee<br /> consequences of their actions and have profited greatly by it. These<br /> individuals think that the rules of mankind and nature and rules in<br /> general do not apply to them and they can write their own ticket<br /> without consequences. They experience a disconnection of normal<br /> love-light in their exchange and actions with other individuals and<br /> rule their life by power and money and at some point if they realize,<br /> which they don't realize, how much they are lacking. They are<br /> substituting power and money for love and what they can buy from other<br /> individuals, which is not true love, and they cling to this easy way<br /> of life. Since they do come from the loving individual of All That Is,<br /> they are at odds with their own true nature but do not realize it.<br /> They have fallen down a scale into a substitute scale of life.<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: Thank you.<br /> Next question. This is from Gary in Encinitis. I have noticed how time<br /> seems to be going faster and faster. Is this a result of aging, in<br /> that when we age our metabolism slows so the time seems to speed up<br /> around us, or is there a quickening going on at this moment as we get<br /> closer to 2012? Is time speeding up like the revolutions of a vortex<br /> as you go deeper into the vortex?<br /> <br /> <br /> Ra'An: Time is speeding up, the actual time is speeding up. Time is<br /> measured by events and events are measured by oscillations and<br /> geometric progressions and as one reaches more into the higher<br /> vibrations, one gets closer to experiencing All That Is in a more<br /> rapid manner so that time is speeding up in actuality.<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: Thank you.<br /> Edna asked us about Seth. Can you share anything about Seth and his<br /> lineage without violating free will?<br /> <br /> <br /> Ra'An: We can share some things concerning Seth. Seth is a very<br /> important valuable personage and spirit that moves with time and<br /> place. He is able to move in and out of groups and that is why he is a<br /> soul traveler that can engage and not be stuck in situations and in<br /> causes. Seth moves with his energy heartbeat and moves to places where<br /> he can make a difference and has a very interesting life and very<br /> interesting projects and he is welcomed by the Elohim and Ra groups.<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: Thank you.<br /> Last question.<br /> How is all all life in love? There is no right and wrong and no<br /> disharmony. I can't understand this. Isn't the Law of One the light<br /> and love also light and harmonic. I thought the goal was to be in the<br /> right, so you would be in the light. This seems saying that wrong can<br /> also be the One? Can you explain this to me?<br /> <br /> <br /> Ra'An: One can take into account that the background of All That Is,<br /> everything is written on love and light and it comes from love and<br /> light. When one comes into the manifest universe there begins to be<br /> duality, and in duality there can be some better solutions or some<br /> worse solutions. There can be the goal to be manifest in the third<br /> density and they become touched by frequencies within the third<br /> density wherein in order for the survival of the body they need houses<br /> and money and they need material things and so this colors their<br /> goals. Then when one has an adverse situation to a goal that they<br /> have, they are confounded and frustrated in their goal and they begin<br /> in their big frustration to choose negative means to accomplish this<br /> goal in desperation, or they may have a past incident wherein it has<br /> carried into the future, which we have talking about previously,<br /> wherein the individual then begins to act out of character for present<br /> time and begins to act in a negative way, according to what is in<br /> present time, however according to the past they may be acting at that<br /> present time, truly in character with what they are imaging in their<br /> mind or thinking is going to happen based upon some past weird<br /> incident or based upon some injustice they have experienced. They may<br /> go down the scale from desiring and giving love, to being so<br /> frustrated and expecting negativity that they themselves become<br /> negative. Each and every situation has it's own history and it's own<br /> story of how the break down occurred from true love-light to fostering<br /> negative feelings and expressions of negative feelings. Everything is<br /> written on love-light to some degree in time, some point in space and<br /> then the individual in the true sense, though they are being negative,<br /> are diametrically opposed to their origins and this eventually will<br /> bring them home.<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: Thank you.<br /> I imagine the going home can take eons of time for some entities in<br /> this realm. Is that true? How long might it take for some entities to<br /> go home?<br /> <br /> <br /> Ra'An: There is no time limit.<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: What is the longer time someone has been trapped?<br /> <br /> <br /> Ra'An: Billions of years and this is part of the reason for the<br /> manifest world not disappearing and not returning to original<br /> love-light.<br /> <br /> <br /> Wynn: Thank you and that was our last question for tonight. Thank you<br /> for being here. We bid everyone on the line and everyone listening on<br /> the replay line a good evening and thanks for participating in what we<br /> are doing.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </p>
