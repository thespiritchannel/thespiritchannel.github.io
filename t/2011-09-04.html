<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> This i<span style="font-size: medium;">s Sunday,</span> September 4, 2011. Wynn and Terry in Sedona</p>
<p>and all of you where ever you are. &nbsp;This is what we call our Grid</p>
<p>Healing. This started out as an experiment and the experiment</p>
<p>was: &nbsp;we had been communicating with this voice that said it was</p>
<p>the Elohim for quite some time. When I would show up to do public</p>
<p>talks, there was all this energy in the room and they would say</p>
<p>it was them and that they were helping. There was this energy in</p>
<p>the room and people could feel it. &nbsp;They would walk out of the</p>
<p>room of these talks and say, "I could see auras. I never saw</p>
<p>auras before." So I asked them (the Elohim), “If I did a</p>
<p>conference call could you show up on the conference call so that</p>
<p>people on the call could feel it?” They said that was possible.</p>
<p>So there began a number of experimental calls so that I could see</p>
<p>if it worked. &nbsp;I'm very empirical. Just because I think something</p>
<p>is going to work doesn't mean I know it, so I needed to get</p>
<p>validation from people that were on the call that they could</p>
<p>sense it. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>So what does it mean to feel the energy of them on the phone, or</p>
<p>anywhere? &nbsp;Well, basically the universe is one energy and we who</p>
<p>are in human bodies are at the bottom of the dimensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the way they describe it, the physical earth is at a</p>
<p>fairly low level and the reason is because we feel separated from</p>
<p>each other. &nbsp;In the higher dimensions beings come together and</p>
<p>they feel part of each other, they recognize each other. &nbsp; In</p>
<p>this dimension people feel separated and they can go on many,</p>
<p>many lifetimes feeling separated. How do you move to unseparating</p>
<p>yourself? &nbsp;How do you get a feeling of connection when you have</p>
<p>such a long period of feeling separated. &nbsp;Well, that's one of the</p>
<p>things that happens on these calls. If you noticed how friendly</p>
<p>everybody was at the beginning of the call. &nbsp;It's because they</p>
<p>were feeling connected. &nbsp;We didn't really do anything</p>
<p>particularly to connect people. &nbsp;They don't know each other</p>
<p>except by saying hello on the call. &nbsp;They don't know what their</p>
<p>jobs are. &nbsp;They don't know if they are married or single. But</p>
<p>they come on these calls and they feel connected. As you will see</p>
<p>as the call proceeds there will be energies on the call that some</p>
<p>of you will feel. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now someone that's new on the call the first time doesn't always</p>
<p>feel the energies. So be patient with yourselves and just track</p>
<p>it along because the energies of the higher realms are not just</p>
<p>here on these calls. &nbsp;They are around 24/7. &nbsp;But the call creates</p>
<p>a reference point so once you experience that energy, it's</p>
<p>something you can come back to when you're by yourself during the</p>
<p>week. It's kind of like having an invisible energy friend in</p>
<p>another dimension, in a very high dimension that's there for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It's learning how to prove to yourself that this might be true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you do that there's an incredible advancement in your own</p>
<p>life path. &nbsp;So we feel their energies and then we make group</p>
<p>intentions for healing the planet. &nbsp;Within our intentions is</p>
<p>always the stipulation that whatever we ask for is for the</p>
<p>highest good of all concerned and doesn't violate the free will</p>
<p>of another being. Sometimes we don't know what's in the highest</p>
<p>good and we don't even know what violates free will, so we just</p>
<p>let the universe take care of that and we make our best shot at</p>
<p>asking. &nbsp;So I'm going to open up the lines and you guys can</p>
<p>contribute your requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody have anything they want to say?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gary- Redondo Beach:</strong> I'd like to put my colleague Cindy</p>
<p>Popp-Hager in the love light. She lives in Sterling,</p>
<p>Massachusetts, and is undergoing treatment for breast cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oren- Utah:</strong> I hear a lot about a false flag operation that may</p>
<p>have been planned, like a fake alien invasion or connected to</p>
<p>comet Elenin, etc. &nbsp;So—protection for people's consciousness</p>
<p>and not being fooled by illusions, and positive synchronicities,</p>
<p>and interference with fear programs. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gina- O’ahu; Hawai’i</strong> : I'm going on a month vacation so I'll</p>
<p>make this jam packed. &nbsp;I'd like to send love and light to</p>
<p>everyone on Gaia and that people's fears subside and that</p>
<p>everything will be okay. I'd like to send light to everyone on</p>
<p>this line. I love you all, and I will miss you at the time that I</p>
<p>am gone. &nbsp;I'd like to also send light to the hurricane that's</p>
<p>forming that there's no major devastation, and I really send a</p>
<p>lot of light to all the whales and dolphins at this time and to</p>
<p>the ones that I will be seeing very soon. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you. There is a volcano going off in Japan right now,</p>
<p>so I'd like to put that volcano in the light for moderation, and</p>
<p>there's a hurricane coming in and I'd like to put that hurricane</p>
<p>in the light for moderation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zoe- Sacramento:</strong> I'd like to ask the love and light to see that</p>
<p>all of those things that are being put forth to the public that</p>
<p>are untrue to be exposed in one way or another so that people are</p>
<p>not taken over by falsehood but have truth to access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael- San Diego :</strong> I'd like to put the energy of discernment</p>
<p>and the energy of common sense in the light and also for creative</p>
<p>expression and the energy of solutions (not just on problems)</p>
<p>let's put the energy of solutions in the light. I'd also like to</p>
<p>put free speech and the energy of expression through the Internet</p>
<p>in the light as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> I wanted to put two things in the light. &nbsp;One is that</p>
<p>there's been a lot of difficulty that I know about with people</p>
<p>getting certain supplements and products that they need either</p>
<p>because of manufacturing problems, prices going up, the</p>
<p>hurricanes and different things getting in the way of shipping so</p>
<p>I'd like to ask that people be able to receive what they need in</p>
<p>terms of products in some way. &nbsp;The other thing is we know a lot</p>
<p>of people right now, myself included, &nbsp;who are looking for</p>
<p>housing and having a hard time with housing and also a lot of</p>
<p>people who in order to keep their homes are for the first time</p>
<p>needing to rent their rooms in their homes and needing to find</p>
<p>just the right person that is good for them to live with. So I'd</p>
<p>like to ask to put in the light the situation of self, safe</p>
<p>shelter, and building community for everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> I'd like to put in the light the situation with radiation</p>
<p>from Japan and some of the activities taking place there</p>
<p>currently. Also, I believe there's also a reactor on the East</p>
<p>Coast in Virginia that has been severely damaged and is being</p>
<p>kind of suppressed. &nbsp;I'd like to put all of these nuclear</p>
<p>reactors in the light to reduce whatever damage they might</p>
<p>produce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cinda:</strong> I'd like to put all nuclear weapons in the light that no</p>
<p>harm can come from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you, anyone else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tameron:</strong> I'd want to put the military in the light, those who are</p>
<p>out serving and the vets that are suffering from PTSD also those</p>
<p>that are missing arms, legs and suffering from loss of limbs,</p>
<p>struggling for homes, things like that, a lot of medical issues</p>
<p>like wheelchairs. The necessity for them to move on with their</p>
<p>lives. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you, anyone else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zoe:</strong> I'd like to put into the light all education world wide,</p>
<p>that the new spirit of inquiry and the new ideas and new ways of</p>
<p>thinking as opposed to the old ways of thinking be introduced and</p>
<p>take hold in education all over the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gijs:</strong> I want to send the love light to the communication between</p>
<p>all positive higher sources that the communication through planet</p>
<p>Earth may be more widespread that more people may benefit from</p>
<p>this and for fear to be taken over by love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Wynn does the visualization).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you. (calls in the light) Father, Mother God we ask</p>
<p>for the presence of the light to surround and protect each person</p>
<p>on this line and any negativity be taken to the higher realms of</p>
<p>light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We</p>
<p>see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating in the center of</p>
<p>the universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way,</p>
<p>through the energies of the solar system and the planets and</p>
<p>through our bodies and into the center of the Earth. Right now we</p>
<p>invoke a group energy connection among all of us while</p>
<p>maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls, and we invite</p>
<p>those sources that are positive, service to others, honoring the</p>
<p>Law of One to join with us as we provide a protected space that</p>
<p>only the positive has access to, and anything not of that nature</p>
<p>must leave now. I turn it over to our Sources and they address us</p>
<p>through Terry…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Terry (RA'AN ):</strong> We greet you in the love light of the one</p>
<p>infinite Creator. We're here with you this September 4, 2011. We</p>
<p>make contact to everyone on the line who wishes contact to be</p>
<p>made. We realize your individual situations and are available for</p>
<p>help. Expression of those things that you wish assistance with</p>
<p>can be made in many ways—through a desire, through asking, or</p>
<p>through an intention that things change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are aware of the things you have put in the light today. &nbsp;As</p>
<p>we look over the Earth and the over the areas that you have</p>
<p>mentioned, we see the storm, and we see that it's not fully</p>
<p>organized. There are winds and thunderstorms, and there is</p>
<p>drenching rain. We take a look further at the weather patterns</p>
<p>over the U.S. that are directing the path of the storm (Irene),</p>
<p>as well as the other storm Katya. We see the prayers of the</p>
<p>people. We see that the media has more and more forecast the</p>
<p>pathways and have anchored this down through broadcasts, and we</p>
<p>set that aside. We send greetings to the clouds, to the systems.</p>
<p>We see that there are not as many people praying at this time but</p>
<p>merely assuming that the pathways are a foregone conclusion. It's</p>
<p>through prayer that things are able be brought about into change</p>
<p>(and through intentions), and so we set forecasts aside. We see</p>
<p>that Texas has not had enough rain and we see patterns of highs</p>
<p>that are keeping this in place, and we work with this, with</p>
<p>setting forecasts aside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We thank each and every person on this line for helping with this</p>
<p>process and helping with the anchoring, and helping with the</p>
<p>intentions and the prayers.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We send love and light to Cindy Popp-Hager for successful</p>
<p>treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We see there is “much ado about nothing” with comet Elenin.</p>
<p>We see that some people are propagating rumors, and others are</p>
<p>saying and projecting the truth. &nbsp;We give support to those that</p>
<p>are protecting and saying the truth: that their message may calm</p>
<p>down the fears moving through the internet and even some radio</p>
<p>programs. We send love and light for discernment and for the</p>
<p>internet, that the voice of discernment be heard within the</p>
<p>hearts of each and every person (but yet allow freedom of speech</p>
<p>for the internet). In the long run the outcomes will tell what</p>
<p>the truth has been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caution must be used in discernment: that one does not take</p>
<p>random events are not connected with something such as comet</p>
<p>Elenin, if events occur simultaneously, to put them under the</p>
<p>category of influence from Elenin. This is where discernment is</p>
<p>important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see discernment is also important with with the choosing of</p>
<p>energy choices, and that events such as the one in Japan with the</p>
<p>reactor lets people know the dangers and make an impetus for</p>
<p>development of more common-sense sources of energy that are not</p>
<p>harmful to the people and to the planet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We send love and light to all people who are producing good food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We note again that discernment comes into play in this area, in</p>
<p>that your planet is biologically active and humans are working</p>
<p>and developing synergistically within this biological</p>
<p>environment. When companies manufacture pesticides they work in</p>
<p>the arena of this biologically active environment. &nbsp;By creating</p>
<p>GMO crops that have a gene of pesticide in their growth, they</p>
<p>upset the human balance of the synergistic relationship between</p>
<p>humans and the biological surroundings. So you end up with</p>
<p>situations where a high percentage of pregnant women and new</p>
<p>babies born have within their system an upset in connection to</p>
<p>biological survival as the pesticide gene then gets in their</p>
<p>system and kills off biologically beneficial bacteria in their</p>
<p>system. They then have upsets in their digestive system and in</p>
<p>their synergistic connection with their life surroundings that</p>
<p>they would not have had. &nbsp;This is where discernment comes in the</p>
<p>development of products for use in the human sphere and the</p>
<p>growing of food.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We send love light to all the agencies who are transporting food,</p>
<p>all the farmers who are growing food, and support to the little</p>
<p>farmer, as it is becoming harder to survive in the atmosphere of&nbsp;</p>
<p>farming because some of the &nbsp;bigger farmers are using methods may</p>
<p>not be quite so healthy, not all big farmers, but some for the</p>
<p>profit motive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We send a blanket of protection; we send a curfew of sorts, upon</p>
<p>the hauling and giving out and the use of nuclear weapons. We see</p>
<p>dangers in this area, and we then move to the hearts and minds of</p>
<p>those who could possibly use these weapons and ask for them to</p>
<p>hear the prayers of the majority of the people for peace.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We send love light for the communication between all people and</p>
<p>the higher sources and the love light that exists in the higher</p>
<p>realms that it may be manifest in the Earth plane and between</p>
<p>people in their relations with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We send love and light to the Dolphins and the Whales as when</p>
<p>Gina said this we connected vibrationally with the Dolphins and</p>
<p>the Whales much to their joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, we send love light that the fear of each individual can</p>
<p>turn to a centering and a confidence that they are important and</p>
<p>worthwhile, and that they have the abilities to overcome all</p>
<p>barriers and obstacles. Is is through contact with barriers and</p>
<p>obstacles that they they can grow and learn to avoid barriers and</p>
<p>obstacles, and can learn that they are senior to barriers and</p>
<p>obstacles, and that love is senior to barriers and obstacles. We</p>
<p>send thanks and love light and appreciation and we feel honored</p>
<p>by each and every person here. We leave but we do not leave.</p>
<p>Adonai.</p>
<p></p>
