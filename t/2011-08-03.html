My name is Wynn Free and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Terry Brown and some great people on the line all over the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">country and we are going to ask questions of our Sources</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">tonight. We have some really interesting questions for</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">tonight. We started out only doing conference calls and I was just</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">going to do Monday nights. We started doing Wednesday because</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">they asked us to do Wednesday. We started Sunday grid healing</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">because I thought it was really important and then I realized</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">why it's important to do three calls a week.&nbsp; And if you read</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">the Ra Material, many people are on the edge of graduating and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">if they are not given support or encouragement, the negative</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">of the world may pull them in. Coming back and listening to</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">this energy helps you stabilize in this transition we are in</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">and helps you focus on something above 3D to keep focused on</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">because as you focus on things above 3D, eventually you start</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">holding the space above 3D. It's subtle. You don't leave 3D</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">but you notice things and don't get so involved. You start</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">dealing with things with less attachments and as if you are</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">looking down on them. No attachments means doing things with</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">no strings, you have to learn how to receive and feel</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> gratitude <br />but not obligation.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Let's now get started.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">(Wynn calls in the light)</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">We wait for their identification.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Ra'An:</strong> This is August 3rd, 2011 and we greet each and every</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">one of you on the line. Each and every one of you who will</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">read the transcript and each one who will listen to the audio.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">It is with our profound appreciation that we welcome this</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">opportunity to make this connection as it is with the contacts</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">that we make that we feel more whole in that we are a part of</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">everything and in the earth field, individuals have, in many</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">cases, isolated themselves and we feel the loss of connection.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">So it is with gratitude that we offer our assistance and ask</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">if you have any questions.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Yes we do.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Our first question is from Margaret in New Zealand. She has</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">been listening to all of our calls. Hi, Margaret. She asks why do</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">people say it's bad to take canola oil? What's bad about</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">canola oil?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">We take a look at canola oil. We take a look at the way it is</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">raised. It is one of the heavily genetically modified crops</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">with genetically implanted genes that make it more susceptible</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">to insecticides. It is raised very cheaply. This is one of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">reasons why it is promoted so widely. The canola oil comes</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">from the rape seed which is also used as a by-product for</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">mustard gas and agent orange. There are not enough nutritional</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">values within the oil. All oils when you heat them lose their</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">effectiveness for the lubrication of the body system. Oils are</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">very important in the operation of the body and we suggest</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">oils such as olive oil, sesame seed oil, walnut oils. We also</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">do not recommend soy oils and there is much genetic</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">engineering going on with soy. Soy does not digest as well,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">even if it was not genetically altered. It does not provide</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">the nutrient value of something like olive oil. Thank you.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Question: We have read in the Ra Material through Carla</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ruckert that the Ra Group graduated from Venus a half a</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">million years ago. Where did the population of Venus come from</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">originally?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Venus was included on the star ship route and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">individuals eventually settled there, however the conditions</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">were not ideal on Venus. It was a very hard planet to subsist</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">on. So eventually the population had to abandon that planet.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">They started much like the population on earth as a discovery</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">planet, in that it was discovered and had drop off and pick up</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">points from galactic travel and eventually developed</span> a<br /><span style="font-size: medium;">population which then moved into the area of decline and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">disaster and many of the group were lost, and many of the group</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">graduated and joined the Ra Group. The Ra Group has a core</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">group from Venus and has been joined by many other travelers</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">since.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: There was also a higher dimensional group soul working</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">with the Phoenicians as they were going through their own</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">evolution. Do I have that information correctly?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: That is correct. They have moved on to higher levels</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">and are still teachers and are working in jobs of recreation</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">and formulation of the operation of consciousnesses at higher</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">levels.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Do they ever join with the Ra Group in the Ra Group's work?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes, they are still available for consulting and still</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">look in on the Ra Group.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Do they have a name that they go by at this point?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes they do have a name. It is something like Gheadans.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Can we send them our love and appreciation right now as</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">we are talking about them?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes they can.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Well we do. Thank you for being part of the grand</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">process.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Their frequency is very very high and they send us love</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">light and it is hard to form into words of dense frequencies</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">of the 3rd dimension.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Colleen had a question about the Monday night call. We talked</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">about someone's high intentions further intensified when others</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">share their high intentions. Do these high intentions from</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">humans create interactions with the Ra or Elohim?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">By high intentions we mean strong intentions. That would be</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">one definition. Also intentions of high integrity and high</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">motivation. These are impetus for not only the Ra and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Elohim Groups but through all connection with all</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">intelligence, as consciousness and intelligence exist in all</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">things and it shifts the electrical potential to some slight</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">degree of the surrounding intelligences to identify; to get</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">the communication; to resonate with that intention. The</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">higher, the intention, the stronger the intention, the more</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">fervent the passion is behind the intention, then it creates a</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">stronger resonance. The Elohim and the Ra Group can thus pick</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">up these intentions and resonate with them and if it is an</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">intention for the highest good can then put themselves behind</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">it, increasing the intention further by the agreement and in</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">resonance with that intention. Then the object of that</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">intention being at a similar frequency to the intention begins</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">to resonate, even at a distance and then can find</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">identification with the source of the intention. The intention</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">can then can begin to be fulfilled.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">What you are talking about is a sophisticated way of</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">understanding prayers, yes?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes it is. As prayers are intention. If prayers are</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">merely mouthed they do not contain the impetus, the passion,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">the fervor, the desire for fulfillment and they lose a lot of</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">their impact.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: I am sure some people are listening to this and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">thinking, ok, that's wonderful. How can a person have a high</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">intention? In their conscious mind they want to have a high</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">intention, but how do they go from the desire to have a high</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">intention, to the actual creation of a high intention?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Need is one of the things that creates fervor and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">passion. It is not so much that a person sits down and decides</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">to have a high intention. It is that there is something that</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">they really, really within their heart that they want to see</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">fulfilled and this intention, this reaching out broadcasts and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">it is this broadcast that then reaches others and creates the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">beginning of fulfillment.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: So when we read in the paper about a mother who's child</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">is caught under a car and she lifts it up and pulls it off of</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">them, that would be an example of a need creating a very high</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">intention.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: That is correct.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: So when a person wants to have a high intention, then</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">somehow they have to have a need to have the intention. If a</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">person says, I want to know God. I want to connect to Ra and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">the Elohim. How do they get the need that makes the intention</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">so high that they get that?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: It is a need for wholeness, a need for communication, a</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">need for connection, a need for knowing that one is not alone,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">that one is part of a family; an integral part of a family and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">through reaching out, then they can receive answers and reach</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">fulfillment. If they isolate themselves and do not reach out</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">to others then it becomes very hard, bec growth is made</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">through connection.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course they need to be there when they don't even know there</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">is something to reach for, so that part of the work we are</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">doing is making you real so that people say, if that is real</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">there is a possibility of a connection. If they don't have the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">possibility they don't reach. Right?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes and also, people's fabric is made up of more than</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">one dimension and so they inherently have the need and the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">ability to connect beyond themselves.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: In olden times, biblical times, there was an idea of</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">making a covenant with God. Like if I do this, will you help</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">me. If I go out and help the poor maybe God will help me back.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">I think that is the example of a covenant and is that still</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">valid?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: If a person makes a covenant or does not make a</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">covenant but fulfills the reaching out, where in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">circumstance you mentioned, the reaching out is the connection</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">with the people that they are helping, the individual then</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">grows in ways they could not have dreamed possible and opens</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">themselves up to circumstances that create growth. This can be</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">instigated by making such a covenant to go out and help</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">individuals.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Just the act of going out and helping people starts to</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">raise your frequency and starts to expand you into other</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">dimensional awareness and that automatically would create more</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">opportunities for connection I would think.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: From the question above, does this nullify working</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">extremely hard for something. Must we deserve what we are</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">praying for?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: If you feel that you do not deserve what you are</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">praying for, that will cut your intention to achieve it. If</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">you have done work behind the thing you are trying achieve it</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">will bring in the results, not only feeling that you deserve</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">it but by opening doorways that will help you achieve it.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Question: There are two points of view circulating around the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">planet right now concerning ascension and division of souls.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">One point of view is that it's going to happen in a particular</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">moment and that everything will shift in that moment and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">everything will separate and the other view is that it is</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">going to be a gradual process. Are both of those views</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">possible and the outcomes is still unknown or is there a</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">predisposition that it's going to be one or the other?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: There are already people that are in the process of</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">ascending. There are circumstances which are creating the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">opportunity for ascension more and more and there is a</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">possibility of many people ascending at one time, so it is</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">possible that both scenarios and outcomes have not been</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">determined fully.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: If there was a moment when many people are going to</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">ascend at one time, is there a time where that moment might</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">occur, like December, 2012?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Since the results are not in at this time we do not</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">wish to predict.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Gjis wants to send light to his brother in the Netherlands who</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">committed suicide a while back, and is there anything you</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">would want to comment about that?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: It is good to send the light to your brother as he can</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">use the light as he has come from a somewhat isolated,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">although he has taken on a higher frequency and it is helping</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">him to send the light to him and give him support and the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">fortification that he is a worthy being who deserves to move</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">on.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Pina asked the question after she hear about Gjis's question</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">and she was thinking about her cousin who committed suicide in</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">early July, just a short while ago. She says she is in a</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">loving space with the situation but her family is not.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Somebody had given her a reading to make sure he crossed over</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">and she came to learn about a loving service he performed for</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">another man who committed suicide after murdering his family.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">He assisted in their crossing over. So her general question</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">is, what is the moral impact of suicide?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: First of all we look at your cousin and see she did</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">have some thoughts that kept her close to this realm, however</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">she has also been released and has moved to the other side but</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">still wishes to come back briefly which has to do with some</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">unfinished business, however the work done with her to release</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">her has helped very much. Each time there is a suicide there</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">are different circumstances, different outcomes and different</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">potentials. Very often when an individual commits suicide they</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">are inclined to come back to recreate the circumstances that</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">caused them to commit suicide and again have to live through</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">those circumstance and learn the lessons they did not learn</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">because of the suicide. Not all suicides are like that however,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">and if one is in dire straits and in great pain and there is</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">no relief for them at that time, if they cross over it can be</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">a relief to them and a putting to an end the period of</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">suffering. They still may have to come back to re- experience</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">the circumstances that let them to that situation and learn to</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">handle the situation differently but learn the lesson to</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">per-empt the movement into the dire circumstance; in other</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">words to learn the lesson to avoid the problem. These are</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">areas of great growth for a person. Also if a person commits</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">suicide, they carry that impetus as a solution into another</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">lifetime and if they do not learn the lesson leading to those</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">problems, they will likely come back to re-experience the</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">problem. Eventually they will in many many circumstances be</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">more kind to themselves and find other solutions and learn to</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">avoid those problems. So in general, in many circumstances, it</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">is some area of their life that has been mishandled or has not</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">been able to be dealt with adequately and they will come back</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">and experience the set up of those problems again, until they</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">can learn the elements of how that problem got there and how</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">to deal with that type of situation without a suicide. But all</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">circumstances are different.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: Thank you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">When a person has to come back to resolve a problem like that,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">they keep them in the loop for tens of thousands of years,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">until the circumstance becomes right to resolve that. It that</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">true?</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes, this is correct. It takes as long as it takes.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: So when we are in this life right now, there is great</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">benefit to resolving our karmic situation now rather than</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">putting them off to some future time.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra'An: Yes that is correct. Observe yourself and love yourself</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">and be kind to yourself and give yourself patience and time.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Wynn: And I imagine that is a good reason to generate a high</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">intent to make a connection with the highest of forces you can</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">while you are still in this body.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">So on that note will be saying goodbye to everybody and thank</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">you so much for being here and for coming on these calls and</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">holding the energy. Without you we would not be doing this.&nbsp;</span></p>

This is not meant to replace seeing your</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">doctor, dentist or any alternative practitioner. &nbsp;Some people</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">get healings here, so you can be open to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
