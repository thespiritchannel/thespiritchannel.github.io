Her body is in Sedona; we never know where else she is—and all of you listening on the call. This is the call where we submit questions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Before we start, I want to share something.&nbsp;We make this idea that the energies of these Sources are on this line and are available. I want to share how that feels, because it's subtle and sometimes people look for something too big and it is big; it can get very big, but it doesn't usually start out big. It's almost like, go to the human level and think how you can go into an environment and suddenly you feel a shift in your own space, or you can be talking to somebody and there's a shift in the space.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It's like an expansion of who you really are. We all need to feel some sense of connection to things,&nbsp;whether&nbsp;it’s on a human level or whether it’s on a spiritual level; it's about connection. It's easier to connect on the spiritual level, the spiritual frequencies, when people come together with a high intent, with the intent to make that connection. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">What happens is we connect with each other, but we're not focused on the relationship with each other. When you focus on the relationship, usually it just stays on the human level. In other words, if two people go out and they have a conversation, it can be very entertaining but it's usually a human conversation. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">When two people get together and the focus is let's pray together, let's do a meditation together, let's blend our energies, the human part gets to the side and there's kind of a space and that space is an expansion of your hologram through the veil in many cases; at that point it becomes easier for these Sources to connect with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>One of the things I've noticed; it blows my mind and it's always a surprise when it happens: I'll start out on the human level and talking to someone and at some point in the conversation&nbsp;I might start talking about the work I do and this is someone who doesn't know about it. I'll start talking about our calls and how they come into the energy field and at the moment I say that, they come in. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I've become sort of astute at noticing it and I hadn’t mentioned that to the other person; then I’ll say, did you notice that? And they usually do. They usually notice the shift. It's like that magic moment when you articulate, because once you've developed the rapport with these Sources and the rapport with the energy, they start paying attention. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So when you talk about it to someone else, now of course it depends how you talk about it. I mean if you are just sounding like you are in a cult and there's this energy on the line, it's not the same as invoking the energies. Try it sometime; I don't know if you can do it manipulatively; I never do. I never think I'm going to talk about it and sometimes I don't; it depends on whom I might be talking to. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">But when I do talk about it, when I talk about it, immediately the energy shifts. So if you want to make the connection, you've got to learn to feel that shift. Coming into the calls is kind of a training on feeling the shift, but when you start taking that and integrating it, making it part of yourself, you then have the Sources as co-creative energies to give you support. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">That happens in however long it happens; it may not happen the first time; it may not happen for the first year; but when it happens, it's like “Wow, I noticed that; that was it.” Then suddenly you realize how to work it, how to work the energy of it. It's kind of like, in the olden days, they might have used the word initiation and really, initiation in my vocabulary—now there's a lot of people who use initiation for negative things and all kinds of stuff—but in my way of looking at a positive initiation, it would be in that moment when you suddenly feel the frequencies of higher dimensions, of positive higher dimensions. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You feel it and then you lose it, but then you say, I want to get back to that and you start working through stuff, so that you can make the connection and learn to hold it. When I say hold it, it doesn't mean like you are aware of it all the time. It's kind of like a background program and all you have to do is say the right words and you activate the program and it's there. It's not necessarily appropriate for it to be there all the time; although you might start to recognize, “Oh, I can feel the background program going,” and you have access to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So on that note, we have some interesting questions tonight. Thank you everyone who submitted questions. Let me see if there are any last minute important questions that have come in. Ok, here's a good one: Mary in Kentucky. “Why don't you ask them if 2012 is the end of us?” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">That's a good question; people wonder about that. Let me see here; I’m adding that to my list and let me see if there are any other questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">One of the things about making these connections is whether 2012 is the end of us, or 2025, one thing is certain, that we're all going to end, so does it matter when we end? One of the things is, while you're in this realm—people have said this and I think it's true—that this realm has the greatest potential for growth of anywhere. If you die, you may not continue growing; you may just get stuck in a certain slot; it could be a positive slot, but I don't know if you continue to evolve in between lives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You come into this realm and there's a great potential for evolution, so that's the reason it's important to be around for a while, particularly if you are coming into these calls, because there's so many things that we're all learning, including me, including Terry, from being here on these calls, that it's good to be around and how can I say it, max out your learning to your highest ability. So on that note, let me call in the Light.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Father-Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light, for the Love Light to surround each and every one of us on this call, listening to this call, Daphne, Terry, myself and everyone on the re-plays and reading the transcripts and that any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the&nbsp;Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way,&nbsp;through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of the earth, through our bodies, and into the center of the earth. Right now we invoke a group energy connection, while&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring The Law of One,&nbsp;to join with us and we create a protected space, that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature, must leave <i>now</i>. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We are a separate and distinct energy yet can totally share energy with people and they might feel it as a very high vibration that is very loving and that has a slight color of pink and something that supports them at a very high level.&nbsp;You had made comments concerning the in-between lives, which is an odd way to term it, as those are almost more real than the life in the third dimension and an individual can indeed make growth in the higher realms. There is knowledge available to them in the higher realms that is not available to them under the veil.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

The sound, as best as I can describe it, was like ringing cymbals, bringing cymbals quickly together to stop them from ringing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

I asked for the healing of scar tissue on my left eyelid last Sunday; were you involved in that sound and if so was it connected in a response to my request on Sunday? If not can you tell me what this sound was about? I do think I am seeing better from my left eye, so in any case, thank you."</span></p>

There has been an assignment of one of these sections of our group to work with you on your eyesight. As it takes working with the&nbsp;individual&nbsp;cells to re-establish circulation, we do not—Give us one more minute to check. We do not see the sound associated with that. There are changes in pressure in areas before earthquakes and this can come across as sound and people that are very sensitive can sense the changes in pressure; it is like a ringing of the earth. As changes are set about that then happen later. Those are our comments.&nbsp;</span></p>

In some cases, as the earth is under pressure, there will be changes to areas. The general direction of the United States is to move through and to dispense with the weakness, such as in the financial system and to build a new foundation that can be enjoyed by the majority.&nbsp;</span></p>

Chris in Memphis, Tennessee asks, "Are Ascension symptoms real and am I experiencing them?" Some people talk about Ascension symptoms, is that a good way to describe it? People think Ascension and they think they're going to be floating away and according to our information, very few people are going to be floating away; most people are going to be having, in one discussion, astral Ascension, which means that they will die a natural death and then move to the higher dimensions after they're dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">For you to take your body with you all your chakras have to be open and that's not going to be available to most people. While in the shift we do have high energies coming in; are those high energies creating shifts in people, which cause symptoms, which might even be negative as people are processing? I think that's what Chris means by Ascension symptoms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Ra'An: </span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Yes. However, what is happening with Ascension symptoms is that if an individual has some area of their connection with the outside world, or some area within their matrix that is not true, or grounded, or is not strong—one example might be one's own connection with power, with their power chakra and their connection with the world and their connection with their fellow man, their daily connection with the people around them—if they are not secure in their own connection with their body and with the people around them, then they will be experiencing the fomenting of that, the connect, the triggering of those areas, due to the higher energies that are in a sense forcing one’s hand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So if one has not thoughts of genuineness or they're shy and they can't be outgoing, these things are becoming triggered by the higher energies, so you are seeing at this time people that are breaking under the stress of this. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We are speaking in general now, not of Chris, but we are speaking in general of society in general. If someone has something that is causing them to not have a solid connection with their surroundings, this at this time will be triggered and they may feel dizzy or they&nbsp;might feel weak and one could say it was a symptom of Ascension. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">However, one can get more detailed and see that it is a symptom of the higher energies triggering the self to make corrections, to come out and release the negativity that has been built up and they have been trying to withhold the negativity, because of it being not socially acceptable, or&nbsp;they've been trying to withhold negativity, because they've been trying to fit in and then there's all of the pressures on them at this time, from the media and from things that have been done. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">For instance, the 9/11 scenario; things have happened that have, from the negative point, triggered people. Their firewall is coming down and it is becoming harder to keep that firewall up and people are then letting the release go, but often it is over-reaction, because they've been holding it in for so long, some people all of their lifetime. As when they were growing up, they hadn't been allowed to interact; they'd been forced to fit a mold and to not be themselves; so some of this is give-and-take as some of the individuals are triggered and&nbsp;need to find ways to release. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Now we see, moving to you specifically; we've been speaking so far in general of the general populace, but moving to your situation, we see some illness in your body that is like a weakness in your liver and give us a moment. The weakness in your liver is creating a difficulty in the communication of your endocrine organs and you are experiencing some symptoms from this that are not Ascension symptoms.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">However, all that you have going on is affected by the higher energy and it is magnifying the weaknesses in the body and&nbsp;the apparency of the situation. It's being magnified by the higher energy coming in. There have also been negative things in the area, that have caused individuals in the area to be concerned and even scared and this also is having an effect. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We mention this, as one of the things is weather, floods and&nbsp;the tornadoes&nbsp;in the central part of the U.S. It's creating some nervousness and we see this as part of the symptoms, as when a body is subjected to conflict and this is conflict--when one feels nervous about their safety, then the cells and the whole body, the chemical reactions of the body, tend to mobilize to respond. However, there is not a lot of response that can be done, so it's a frustration and a continued nervousness about the safety in the area, so this is a complex thing. We hope we have made some sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

This is from John and he's going through certain symptomatic things. I think he said irritable bowel syndrome and he's saying, “Oh my God, do I have cancer? Am I sick or is it in my mind?” Now, we’re not doing diagnosis here, so don't say anything that is going to get us in trouble. But the next question is, he's feeling his own psychic awarenesses getting higher and as he becomes higher, he feels like he's maybe taking in things that can damage his body or makes him sick or ill. If that's true how can he protect himself?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Ra'An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>One can learn fine control and if one is moving into areas that are having a negative effect or a conflicting effect on the body, then one can use meditation to tune out from those things and to re-set oneself so that one is tuning out those negative things. As one becomes more aware, they can sense some of these things, some of the negative things and they can feel the effect of conflict, and the negative effect it has on the body. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The body emits certain chemicals in response to negativity in order to attempt to defend itself. It affects the digestive system. So in your awareness, be aware of things that are in conflict within your own system and within your thoughts and in conflict with you and other people. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">When one has negative thoughts and resistances, and resentments within their own self, it creates a difficulty with the body and then the body cannot flow and function and some of the cells do not get the proper oxygen and can then go out of control. They do not get the proper nutrients and release certain toxins and certain chemicals that are built up when a person is under stress. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So meditation is a good way to sort this out and to see what is coming in as conflict and worry and nervousness and during the period of meditation, to let that all go and nurture your cells that they can then recover and can grow strong. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Some of this has been taken on from others that are in your surroundings and you can make the boundary, that that is theirs and to then within your own self, give your own cells in your body a chance to release the negative chemicals that have been&nbsp;released&nbsp;into your system and to then send healing energy and draw healing energy from the outside into your body, so your body can connect to a&nbsp;positivity&nbsp;and not be bathed in worry and some negative things, that have come from others in your surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>

This is from Peg in Massachusetts: "Sometimes I feel my spirituality is being taken over by negative forces and I have a hard time getting back on track. Can this really happen or is it just my imagination working overtime? Thank you so much for all you do."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Yes, you can be taken over by the negativity of others, but in order to be taken over by the negativity, you need to have something within yourself for it to ground to. There are other circumstances where individuals using witchery are able to use witchery methods and processes to take over your body and to send it on a declining path.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

One has free will and if one has made a contract, say a contract to come into the third dimension realm and to be here for a certain number of years and then to leave and to go back to the higher realms, if one has made that contract before they came in, then one has the free will to keep with it or to change it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We give you an example: There was a man who made the contract to come in and to live for 32 years and to marry, but to leave after 32 years. After 32 years and he found his true love and he was living with her and he was totally and completely in love with her and his time, his 32 years was up and he did not want to leave; he wanted to change his contract because he was so much in love with his wife. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So, although his body became infirm and ill and to all appearances should have died at 32, he hung on, and on, and on to be with his wife and to love and feel love with the union of his wife and the self. He lived probably two more years after that and then he passed on and then he still hung on as a guardian angel for his dear wife and he then was asking that his wife find another, that she could be happy and feel happiness again with another beautiful relationship and the growth had been magnificent between the two of them and she was able to feel love and open.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">So that is an example of one thing; a person has free will and they can change their future; they can change their contract, or they can stay to the contract that they have made so solidly. We hope that helps.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Ra'An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>That is correct and it is always up to the individual whether they continue to experience what they have planned and what they are working out and&nbsp;how they move with their own growth. It is possible that an individual can, by something being put in the Light, have a new renewed opportunity for a different choice, that wouldn't have been there unless it had been put there or they had been open to it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

The question is from Ross, I think in England and his question is, "What is this dysfunction? Is there a metaphysical aspect to it? Why do they choose swear words instead of other words?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

This can be worked with; it is very&nbsp;embarrassing&nbsp;and hard for the person with Tourette’s, but that is our thumbnail sketch of what is happening.&nbsp;</span></p>
