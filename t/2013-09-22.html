<p class="western"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4"> Hello everybody. This is September 21</span><sup><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">st</span></sup><span size="4"> 2013. This is our Sunday; we call it a grid healing.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Terry:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> It’s September 22</span><sup><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">nd</span></sup><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">, [2013] </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> It is?</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Terry:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Yes. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Yes, it is. As a matter of fact my computer says so.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Why does my computer have the wrong date? </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Terry:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> It slowed down.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Your computer is schizoid.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Terry:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> It lost time.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> If I were a stubborn king, I would say, “This is September 21</span><sup><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">st</span></sup><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">” and I decree it.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> One of our callers, I did not catch the name; it was someone ill with pneumonia. So we need to take just a second and everybody send a little love that way. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Ok. Bring it up when we get to the healing part of the call, when we bring the energies in.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> All righty.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> I was going to play another song. Let me see if it uploaded, it supposedly did. Hang on a second; just a moment. Here it is. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">When I was in Philadelphia growing up, I remember distinctly feeling, “What am I doing here? Nobody understands me.” And I used to go to our Thanksgiving dinners and all the relatives would come over. And I would have to fold my hands and just bite my tongue and wait till it was over. And everyone would then go to the living room and hang out. And I was just being good. I felt really out of it. I don’t know if maybe some of you felt that way, maybe some of you felt connected. But I didn’t. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">At one point I started listening to Bob Dylan. One of the reasons I love Bob Dylan so much, at least the early Bob Dylan, is that he was talking to the part of me that felt disconnected. It’s like somehow he was embracing the thoughts unspoken and obviously he did it for many people aside from me. That’s why he got so successful. And his lyrics were crafted so well that when I look back at it from the perspective of right now, I have to say I think he was channeling. I think he was tapping in. And even he in an interview said, “I can’t write songs like that anymore.” And when he first started writing songs he was encumbered. He wasn’t thinking about success, or if he was, his ambitions were not apparent in his music. I think that as he got older and as he had a career, he probably got more drawn into having other influences in his mind when he was writing songs because his songs don’t have the quality in more recent times, I don’t believe, as they did when he was younger. Things like “</span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><i>Blowing in the Wind.</i></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">” I don’t know if you remember that. Was Bob Dylan an influence on you, Carla?</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Surely. By the time he came along I was already very well set in my ways as far as being a folk music person, but when I was singing in coffee houses you had to cover his songs because that’s all people asked for. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Do you remember the song, “</span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><i>I Shall Be Released</i></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">”? </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Oh, yeah. Isn’t that a wonderful song? Now I thought of that as more of The Band. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> That was The Band but it was a Bob Dylan song. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> I’ll be dog-gone. I didn’t know that. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Looking back at that song from today’s vantage point, it’s as if on some intuitive level he understood the idea of graduation from this realm because the song is very much from my ears a very spiritual song. When I was young I remember it was one of the songs, one of The Band songs that I played over and over and over again even though I didn’t completely understand the lyrics, I don’t know if anyone understood the lyrics in terms of graduation, the idea of graduation, or the idea of moving from this realm to another realm so that you didn’t have to keep repeating all the travesties of 3-D. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">So I’m going to play that song if you never heard it. Listen to the lyrics on this: </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">"I Shall Be Released"</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">They say everything can be replaced<br />They say every distance is not near<br />So I remember every face<br />Of every man who put me here<br /><br />I see my light come shinin'<br />From the west down to the east<br />Any day now, any day now<br />I shall be released<br /><br />They say every man needs protection<br />They say that every man must fall<br />Yet I swear I see my reflection<br />Somewhere so high above this wall <br /><br />I see my light come shinin'<br />From the west down to the east<br />Any day now, any day now<br />I shall be released<br /><br />Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd<br />A man who swears he's not to blame<br />All day long I hear him shouting so loud<br />Just crying out that he was framed<br /><br />I see my light come shinin'<br />From the west down to the east<br />Any day now, any day now<br />I shall be released </span></p>

<p class="western"><br /><br /></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Now Carla, did those lyrics impact you when you were younger as much as they do now?</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Well, I thought they were gorgeous, I thought they were beautiful. I can’t say that they impacted me differently then than they do now because I always thought they were beautiful. And believe it or not, when I was nineteen I was already working with the ET communication group so I was already weird.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> You were, I see, alright.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla: </b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">And so,</span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b> </b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">no, it didn’t change for me; I’ve been set in my ways a long time.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> I’m just curious. I think I’ll open the mics for a second. Is there anyone listening that was influenced by Bob Dylan tremendously when they were younger? I just thought I’d see if anyone wants to share. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carolyn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> I love Bob Dylan.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Who is that?</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carolyn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Carolyn in Medicine Hat.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Carolyn, you didn’t send me your address. Carolyn, send me your address because I was going to send you some thumb cards and I didn’t have your address easily accessible.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">You can look that song up. It’s called, “</span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><i>I Shall Be Released</i></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">”. I’m sure the lyrics are up there--amazing lyrics. I suppose if one was a Christian or Christ oriented, I think the lyrics would have probably connected easier when you were younger. Although it’s not a Christian song, it is a Christian song. What am I saying? I’m saying that it relates to the idea of graduation. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Before the call today I was thinking that in the context of our sessions, there are little things that have grabbed me. There are things that have grabbed me in Carla’s sessions and there are things that have grabbed me in our sessions--things that were not so obvious and that I kept thinking about the meaning of. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I’m addressing this because I had an interesting email from someone in our group, someone who listens to our calls. In the course of these calls we have come up with the most extraordinary understanding of how things work and how the universe works. And it goes to a certain point and it feels like, “Jeesh, could there be anything more?” And then suddenly there’s a whole new breakthrough, that whole gold mining thing in South Africa suddenly adds a whole other dimension to the big picture.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I recognize that for me, and maybe for some of you, [we may] identify with this as we learn the real history of how things work. Many of us have been there, have done that, and it triggers cellular memories of some sort. For me, it helps me understand myself and understand certain patterns that I have that otherwise were inexplicable because part of us became who we are right now because of all the experiences we have gone through in the past.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Aside from this lifetime, some of us can’t even remember what happened to us this lifetime, we’ve had numerous lifetimes previously where all these things happened and it’s kind of like your soul is a giant computer, it just remembers everything and takes it all in. And then when it comes back in another body, it is accessing all of those things in the past. So if you have talents it’s because you’ve had them in the past. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">For example, I happened to have been a songwriter and I remember I had a reading. This was an epic event for me. I had a reading from someone; they told me I was duplicating all of these patterns as a troubadour a thousand years ago in England, and they told me the whole story of what happened to that troubadour. This was about thirty-five years ago, at least. I wouldn’t say that I believed in reincarnation at that point, I was certainly open to it. I had read Edgar Cayce. But he told me this story of being a troubadour and after he told me the story I realized I had written this song years before he told this story of this troubadour but I thought it was from my imagination. It was so precisely aligned with the story that he told me that I said reincarnation has to be real. That was my first real, direct cognition experience of remembering a past life which actually I didn’t even know I was remembering it. It just came out as a stream of consciousness song. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">So the patterns in that life, the people who were in that troubadour life which was my father, my girlfriend at the time, they all fit the profile precisely of the story he told me. I started to begin this assimilation of how it works, how these energies that we’ve created over the past exist today just as well they did at the time we experienced them. We all carry this load of stuff, but we don’t know it, we don’t know where it comes from and it’s just confusing. Why am I here? Who am I? Why do I have this pattern? Why do I have this hang up? And it’s all connected with our entire track.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Well, when many of us, or some of us, I don’t know how many, but some of us have really old tracks. We’ve gone back to the origination of humans on earth. We go back to Maldek. We had lives on other planets, in other cultures, planetary cultures. We may go back even further than that. We’re really old souls and yet every time we come into a body it’s like amnesia, no memory, but when you hear the story of somewhere where you existed then it triggers things. When you have a fascination in history for a certain period of time, like if you’re interested in Egypt then there’s a good chance you had a lifetime in Egypt. For some of you, you were around during the life of Jesus. For some of you, you were around during the Revolutionary War. When you have an interest in history, there is a good chance you were there. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">So here we are again bringing all of this huge track and when we look at it from the vantage point of today, the challenge becomes how do we live in this moment. It doesn’t mean that entire track is not still there, it’s there, but can you reset your timeline to above that track so that you can operate outside of the limitations, the contractions. Of course, you can take what’s good out of it. If you had a talent or if you had certain really great qualities you can learn to draw on them. On the other hand the things that are in your face, how do you operate without them still being in your face? </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Well, hearing about stuff helps to reset timelines. Learning the history of everything can start to bring “ah hah!” experiences, I won’t say it will for everyone but [it] can. And you see how things work. You see why this planet is in the situation it’s in now and that is one way to accelerate your own growth to hear those things and assimilate them. That’s why all the stuff in our archives is so valuable because it does that and Carla’s archives as well.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">The other thing, this was a little thing that came through one of the sessions, I think with Terry, sometime ago. I don’t think I’ve ever mentioned it, I don’t think so. But it was one of those bits of wisdom that blew my mind and made me kept thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about it. It had to do with graduation of this realm and the idea; I’m not going to quote this directly because I don’t have it in front of me. But the idea is that you go to what you’re connected with. And when you die all the connections you have energetically you carry with you. And where you end up next time you have an embodiment has to do what you’re connected to. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Carla says something similar. And she said you go to the highest level of light that you connected to in the physical. Do I have that right, Carla?</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Well, you go to the highest density of light that you’re comfortable with.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> That you’re comfortable with, right. It’s close, it’s a paraphrase. If you’re comfortable with it that means that you had experience there. And right now all of us are connecting on this call to certain levels of light. Maybe not the same for all of us but if you keep coming back one of the reasons you keep coming back is because part of you recognizes that experience. One of the things that I’ve learned from this idea is that it is very important who you connect with, who you choose to connect with in your physical life this lifetime. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">There are two kinds of relationships in your life: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">There’s relationship of family, of blood, of work. Those are all kind of obligatory relationships that was the foundation. Now work necessarily has some choice in it because you can quit your job, but it’s not easy to quit your family. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Then there are relationships of choice, and relationships of choice are the most important. Relationships of choice are where your free will is most operative. You don’t have freewill with your family, I mean you do, you can leave, but you can’t change your family, you can’t change your parents. If you have a job and you need money it’s not easy to make a choice to change your job. You can, but most people don’t and they don’t because for many of us it’s so hard to feel secure in this realm and our job is what keeps us feeling secure. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">But what are the choices of freewill? The choices of freewill are the choices that are most important because keep in mind that every person is a universe. Every person is radiating a reality that’s part of the universe. I should say everyone is potentially a universe but they’re segmented in it. So they are a transmitter of their segment. When you choose to connect with another person, you are choosing to relate to that segment of the universe that they are radiating for better or for worse. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">So if one is on a path of evolution, if one is on a path of expansion, if one is on a path of God realization then you have to look very carefully at what you are choosing because if you are choosing things in your life that are radiating realities that are contracted, and certainly friends would come into this category, if you’re choosing friends that are radiating contracted parts of the universe, that’s what you’re connecting to, and if that is your predominant choice through your life then there’s a good chance in your next life you’re going to end up in that same reality of choice. So choosing people, if you can, [is important]. This is tricky because it has to present itself to you that you have the option for those choices. But you start out with an idea. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">One thing is, all of you chose to show up here today. That’s a choice, that’s a freewill choice. There are no control mechanisms here that require anyone to show up. It’s been my experience that this particular event we do on Sunday radiates a very wide part of the Universe hologram, and that by coming here, you are entraining yourself to feel that energy and as you feel it, it starts to become part of your track. You adopt it. And because of its nature it’s not regulated to Sunday morning. As you expand into those larger energies and you start to integrate them and you become familiar with them, it’s inevitable that you will attract things into your life that are of a more expanded nature. You’ll attract people, you’ll attract opportunities and this is where many people that come into our calls regularly end up having synchronicities. Synchronicity is one of the ways the universe works to bring back to you. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">But when you have relationships that are of a more contracted nature, it doesn’t mean that you should suddenly eliminate them from your life. You may at some point want to. You have to look at: Can you integrate that without it compromising you? Where it compromises you is when it’s a contracted relationship that has a control pattern to it, then it will do everything it can to bring you into its control pattern and then it’s hard to get out of it. This is why what we call negative or service to self is so tricky because it can be seductive, it can look good and then it brings you into a control pattern. Once you’re under its control pattern you can get stuck for the rest of your life. It’s kind of like when the mafia loans you money and it looks like: “Wow, this is great!” Once that happens, you’re usually, even when you pay the money back, you’re still stuck in some kind of control pattern with them that it’s very hard to extricate yourself from.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">So choices [are important], people ask often times, “Where’s freewill? Where is freewill?” Freewill is in your choices. [It’s] in your choices of who to relate to. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Now, when you want to relate to someone that has a more expanded matrix, a more expanded place of holding the universe hologram [then on some level you have to make yourself worthy of that.]. Again, each person is holding a piece of the Universe in their space either more expanded or more contracted. Even the most contracted are still part of the Universe, and during the course of our day we are moving through all those people. If you’re sensitive you pick up each of their pieces of the hologram. At the end of day, depending on what you went through that day, you can easily feel contracted because of all the people you have taken in. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">How do you fix that? Well, if you want to connect with people that have more expanded views of the hologram, then at some level you have to, at least, make yourself worthy of that. And if someone is holding a greater piece of the hologram than you are, then really, they are your teacher. They’re not your teacher because you’re going to class, this whole hologram sharing is very psychic, it’s very osmosis, it’s not what somebody says; it’s not what they tell you; it is an energy transfer that as you feel and be around somebody’s energy, you can take in that energy and over a time assimilate it and you learn and you start operating differently. That’s really the way we learn, from that process of energetic interaction. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">If you have that opportunity then you have to somehow let the other person know, and this is a nonverbal thing. You have to let them know that you’re getting it. They may not even understand what I just said of this thing, but they still may be holding that bigger piece of the hologram. They still may be your teacher, you may learn from that. You can even learn from the negative who are holding bigger pieces of the hologram and long as you don’t get caught in some kind of control web. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">So how do you do this? Well, I notice different patterns like: I think I’m holding a fairly big piece of the hologram. I think so. And I notice people are often attracted to me and they want to talk to me. When they start talking to me, the first thing they want to do is tell me what they think about everything and give me all of their opinions. And you know what? They don’t usually hold my attention. I can tell. It doesn’t matter what somebody saying. If they’re holding my attention, I know we’re making a connection. If I’m just being polite and diplomatic, which I’m not very good at but sometimes I try, then it’s kind of like being at my parent’s Thanksgiving dinner where I had to be polite and diplomatic to all my relatives, but nothing was holding my attention, nothing was interesting and it was all formal. Think about people like that in your life. I think about people like that in my life. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Now I tell people, “You’re not holding my attention. If you’re going to talk, you’re going to have to find something that holds my attention because it’s a waste of my time just being polite to satisfy your ego that wants to tell me how smart you are.” And so I have to decide that for myself. But it’s an automatic thing; it’s not like how smart someone is. It’s all about are they holding my attention. If they’re holding my attention there’s a good chance we’re connecting in other levels. The interesting thing is, when you start making connection in higher realms, when you start making connections in co-creation high vibrations in other dimensions, it’s really easy to keep someone’s attention in this dimension because you have already got their attention on a higher level. And even if they go “dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.” It can be interesting. I mean on some of these calls I believe we’re doing that. That’s why we can talk about anything and go anywhere and even if I screw up or if Terry screws up or if Carla screws up . . . when I say “screw up” I mean I say something dumb or go off the track, the energy immediately comes back because the whole call is based on a relationship that starts somewhere else not based on the words of communication. And that allows a lot of creativity in the words. That’s where channeling comes from. Channeling comes from when a relationships starts way up somewhere else and then the words come out and they’re formed out of another dimension and not out of this dimension. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Of course, on the other end of everything, gossip is where things are formed in this dimension. And usually gossip is some of the worse kinds of communication because what it is is it’s trying to get energy from another person by telling them things about someone else and they trying to keep the energy going. “Did you know Wynn did this? Did you know Wynn did that? And did you know so and so slept with this person? And dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.” And you see it attracts a lower level of hologram, of universe hologram. So if you’re doing that it’s probably good to monitor yourself and stop because you’re creating a connection to lower levels. I watch this happen. Some months back I realized that connecting with people, really connecting with them, creates opportunity to share consciousness for them to learn something from that connection. Not from what I’m teaching them, not from what I’m doing, but from the connection of consciousness. People learn from that, they feel the energies. It’s one of the reasons I started to become aware of that principle and I said that’s why we’re going to do three conference calls a week because so many people are trying to pull them themselves up into a higher level of awareness and realization and whatever and we’ve all been inundated by negative stuff most of our lives and past lives, not all but a lot, and you’re trying to get through those patterns and so you need a reference point. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">And so these conference calls, I had the idea, I didn’t know if it would work but I had the idea that if you’re going to tell people that they can graduate this realm and they need to have an open heart, if you’re going to say that, the first thought for a lot of people is fear, that, “Oh, oh. I’m not going to graduate. Am I graduating?” More important than telling them that was to create an environment where the energies come in where our heart energies would open. And that where people could feel that energy and use it for themselves. Because I can’t be everyone’s friend, I actually like being people’s friends, I like talking to people but I don’t have time, it’s not a good use of my time. And the other thing I thought was when there was gossip I end up talking to someone and before you know it, they’d be telling someone else, “Wynn talked to me. Wow, I must be…” And then the other person would get jealous and it was a way of creating more negative flow in this realm. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">I bet Carla has some experiences in this whole thing. I hope I’m not catching her off guard. Does anything I’m saying make sense to you, Carla? I know that you understand this principle even if you never put it in those words. Because I know you to the best of your ability make yourself really available to people and you are really loving and it helps the people tune into their love when they connect with you, ok? Because you hold that space, that’s your space of the universe that you hold. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Yes, that’s true. And I do it very consciously and I think that people feel that they know me and that they trust me. And I try to be just as trustworthy as the day is long. And because that’s my purpose at this point in my life, I’m a reference point, I’m a direction home. And people feel that they know me and they feel that they can relate to me and they can read whatever I’ve written or whatever I’ve channeled and I don’t mind that. It would bother a lot of people to be so known. It doesn’t bother me at all. I want to open my heart; I want to give it away. I have plenty left over, I have an endless supply and I know that. There’s very little doubt that people will get it wrong because I’m so frank and so honest and people do know me, they know me well and they know me right that they don’t make mistakes about it. They know me for what I am and what I am is a loving person. Just to know that there’s a loving person there, to know that they do have a friend. This is something that is a saving grace for people because what they want the most is to have someone, some companions to be friends and all of these things so you’re not isolated in this and the whole start of the program was so the people would have a goal and a reason, all of these reasons are within me as coming home. We stand for it and we stand for the people that respond to the material that we’ve given through the years. So yes, I know what you’re thinking about and I think that it’s extremely helpful. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Now a topic for a whole other Sunday would be that there is freewill involved in the relationships that don’t seem to have freewill, mother, father all of those relationships. We do set up contracts with people before we’re born to be our parents, to be our children, to be our lovers and friends and mates. But that’s not for this Sunday. This Sunday we’re talking about making contact, making contact with, to use your language, with a bigger part of the hologram which is available to those people. And because you know those people then there’s an osmosis that takes place. And you can be a help for helping people to touch into that wider spectrum of vibrations so that if they’re seeking that lift they can get it. And isn’t that why we’re here? We’re here to help each other to do just that, to give of ourselves and to stand for each other in a loving way so that people that we couldn’t possibly know will still have access to who we are and be able to open up to the realms of spirit that we represent. I guess that’s saying as well as I can.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Very well put. Another way of looking at the same same thing, it’s a different way of saying it, is each of us is a universe transmitter all the time. Each of us is a universe transmitter and we’re transmitting a signal, actually it’s like a repeater station the whole universe is coming into our space but you repeat it at the level of the hologram that we have mastered and we repeat into the space around us. As you get more powerful, the repeating gets stronger, and it starts to go beyond your own space and it reaches people outside of your space---like I realize I go into meditations and contemplations or just lying there and feeling connected. And then I start thinking about people that I know, people in our group, people that are going through things. And I just can feel them. Think of people that you care about. Suddenly there’s an energy that comes in for me and I think I’m really connecting with them. I’m sure this is true, I’m sure there’s an energy flowing between me and the person I’m thinking about. And I do it for a bit and I just send loving thoughts. And of course I don’t intrude on anyone’s space; I wouldn’t even connect if they weren’t connected. The part of us that’s connected in truth always stays connected. It’s there to be accessed. And it’s a really good exercise in making a difference. It’s really simple, just lie there and start contemplating the people you care about and send them love and you’ll know you’re doing it. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">People ask me, “How do I know if I’m graduating? How do I know this?” Well, if you can do this, the chances are you’re graduating because I don’t think you can send love unto people and feel the connection in this realm. That’s happening in the fourth dimension. Do you realize that? To be able to contemplate and just send a loving energy to people does not happen in 3-D. It happens in 4-D. So this is a good kind of mile stone to say, “Jeez, I can do this! I can send love to people, I can feel . . .” You have to feel the love. It’s not emotional. It’s different. You have to feel it, and if you feel it, you’re in 4-D. You’re not in 3-D; because you can’t do that in 3-D. 3-D is power and individuality. Love is a blending of energies at the moment. And you have to be an individual in order to do 4-D because you have to come from somewhere. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">In other words, if you didn’t develop the lower chakras and you just started blending you’d get lost in the blend. You’d never come back, you would just disappear. So part of the evolutionary process is to be an individual so it’s not bad to be in 3-D. It’s part of your growth. And I never thought of this before and I think it’s a great concept that when you can send love to somebody and feel it in the distance, not in person because in person, it might be true in person, but in person often times it goes into more psychic lower level interactions of love which are ok. There’s nothing wrong with them, in fact they’re great. But when you cannot be with the person physically and you can experience inside of yourself a loving connection with the person. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Now, this does not mean to say “I love you” or thinking “I love you”, no. I think we could do it right here and you’ll get what I mean. We do it right here all the time but I’m just putting it in different words. Let me just see if Carla has anything.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Wynn, I want to tell you, not to interrupt this flow of creation that you’re going through, but I wanted to say: this is prayer. But prayer is often misunderstood. And you think you have to be doing something to be prayerful. But if you’re worrying, if you’re thinking, if you’re focusing on somebody else in a loving way that is a prayerful thought. That is going to, as you said, it’s in 4-D. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">People who are so good at worrying, I tell them, “Do you realize that you’re actually praying? You’re just not relaxing about it. Instead of worrying, just send the love. Release the concern and just send the love.” But when your focused on somebody else, not because you need to be but because you want to be, this is a loving, prayerful connection, and it is indeed in a higher realm and it does seek to serve. And it’s not an intrusion because of the fact that in spirit the love goes where it’s needed and where it’s accepted and if it’s not accepted then it doesn’t. It wouldn’t intrude. So there’s nothing intrusive about it. You’re just holding someone in thought. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> And you can always tell if it’s working because your own vibration gets lifted when you do it.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> That’s true. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> And if it’s not working, in other words, it may not work because you’re doing it for the wrong person or it may not work if you don’t have the right relationship with that person. But find people in your life that you can do this with. And again, how it feels is you make an image of that person in your mind and--a precursor--you’re not going to violate their freewill, their high self has to let this through and you create the image of that person and send them love. Send them unconditional love, not emotional love, but the radiation of love. And if it’s working, it comes back to you and you can feel the energy when it comes back and you feel a lifting of your own spirit. If you can do that, you’re operating in 4-D. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Those of us who have read about 4-D and you think that 4-D is something faraway and you have to wait for a new planet or a new something or to graduate. You don’t have to wait; you can do it right now. And you can learn and practice, find people. And if you can’t find anyone else that’s in your life, try it with me or Carla or Terry or any one of us in the group that you can identify with, that you feel a connection with and let that energy go. And practice 4-D. When we do this call we combine our spirits in our meditation. We are in 4-D. That is 4-D. You are experiencing it. So the more you experience it, the more you can apply it to your own life. And that’s why you’re choosing to be here. You do not have to be here. We’re all busy. We have lots of things to do. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">So the things you choose are not your karma, they are outside of your karma. They can become your karma if you choose the wrong things. But we all have our karma obligations and our contractual self that we came in to do. And you need to find things to choose that are above that that pull you in to the higher dimensions. Because usually, not always, but usually all the karmic things don’t do that. They keep you in 3-D. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">And I should let Terry say something. Terry is awesome. When people talk on these lines, I’ll tell you, you guys don’t realize it but when there’s opportunities to say something or when we constantly read the prayer request, Terry takes it in and she does spend time, if we had enough money I think she’d just be praying for people all day because she knows intrinsically the power of this. Terry, do you want to share?</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Terry:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Ok. I realized when you’re concerned about somebody and you’re thinking about somebody it very often transmits to them. And you can have coincidences happen, like suddenly they’ll call you. You’d be thinking of them and it’s almost as if you’ve reached the level of telepathy, so that you can talk on some level and you know if you’re on the same page or not. And maybe if you’re not on the same page, then you’ll go over and over in your mind and try to think how you can get on the same page with them and if they could only understand in some level, that translates to that other person. So when, as an individual, you may begin to try to see how they’re feeling about it, how they’re thinking about it, then something can release on a master level, on a main level. And all of a sudden that person is calling you on the phone. And all of a sudden there are breakthroughs in the relationship. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> I’m just reading emails and Gee Gee in Vancouver sent me a song that they thought was great and from Sergio Mendez but I’ll listen to it and if I remember, I might play next week. Thank you. Thanks, Gee Gee. I can’t play something right now because I have to upload it, there’s this whole process. And we have our hi-fi telephone system here.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">It’s kind of amazing that, even though we have the worse hi-fi over the phone, that when spirit is present it can still reach you. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Let’s see I’m checking here my emails. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Carla:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> What Terry said was really good that even if you’re having some communication problems there’s comes a point at which there’s a breakthrough and bam, that person and you are on the same page and you’re going to communicate one way or the other. That’s happening a lot, again and again.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Right. And often times when you do this with somebody, when you can hold this loving energy with somebody silently, don’t dare tell them you’re doing it. At least I won’t say don’t dare but maybe don’t jump up and down and tell them, it might scare them and it might have been working. But over time there is a change in the relationship.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">If we talk about changing the world and a lot of people are talking about changing the world. The one thing that will change the world is having a lot of humans sending loving energy, being broadcasters of love from their own being into the planet. That changes the world. That is becoming a co-creator with all that is. That is doing God’s work. And that we are needed to do that. Everyone, everyone listening to my voice right now, has the ability to do that and we are teaching by example on these calls how to do it because we’re doing it. We do it every Sunday call. Let’s just say I love you silently. Let’s do it right now. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We are creating love out of nothing and you can do that in your sphere of influence. Don’t try to create love by engaging with people. It doesn’t mean you can’t engage with people, it doesn’t mean there can’t be loving interactions. But the highest love is in 4-D, it doesn’t need engagement, it’s psychic, it’s a psychic transmission back and forth. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">(Meditation and healing)</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Let’s just do a quick calling in of the Light and turn it over to our Sources through Terry for their message of the day.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Father/Mother God we ask for the presence of the Light to surround and protect us all, any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the outer energy fields of the planet Earth, through our bodies and to the center of the Earth. And right now we evoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. And we invite those Sources that are positive, service to others, honoring the Law of One, to join with us. And we create a protected space that only the positive has access to. And anything not of that nature must leave now. Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Ra’An:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> We greet you in the Love Light of the One Infinite Creator. We take a moment and we have ability to focus. We can do like a broad focus, like a camera lens that takes in broad scan or we can focus down to a narrow focus. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We realize that in the focusing we are focusing life within the all that is, the one being of all that is, the intelligence that is there with you and that you are with and that is an overlay. You are connected, you are a part of an integral part of, so that when a thought goes down it is projected. You are not alone. And the being, the one being of all that is, gets it, and is right with you. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">If you understood the language, if you understood the signals, you would receive the information that one being has gotten it, it is immediate. There is no delay; that one being is right with you. So that when you and another person are in thought processes together and are telepathically thinking about each of your own positions in something, the all that is, the being is getting everything from both sides, is seeing it, and it is a vehicle for which thoughts can be given immediately, it is not bounded by the speed of light or your location. And that one being is there and you are a part of the one and you are cared for and you are as a child of the one being. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">There is a whole realm that is available to you when you can see beyond your own veil, your own mechanisms of focusing of your own life energy. That takes up a lot of your energy and a lot of your attention. The one being is there, is loving, is intelligent, is getting it. We are a part, the Elohim, the Ra group; we are a part of all that is. We are a part. We are focusing, we have focusing ability and the ability to set up focusing mechanisms to direct thought to help create consciousness. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We take a moment and we take a look at all the things that you have put in the healing list, each and every one of you and the ones that have not put anything but have thought it. You’re thinking of it, you’re writing it down, the intention for the best of all that is for Possum. It comes through loud and clear. And then it is up to Possum to partake of that what she wishes, what she can receive and accept. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">For each and every one of you, you have placed a prayer written on the skein of time, on the Universe. And this is not ignored. This is there as a building block, as a construction as something that can be grasped by those who are open to grasp it. And as you reach out, this construction of thought mechanism helps build your world and helps make more possible to you. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We’re with you in Love and Light and we leave but we do not leave. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Thank you. </span></p>
