<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">We’ve been channeling a source called the Elohim; then later it was joined by a section of the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>They called themselves Ra’An:<span>&nbsp; </span>Ra from the Ra group and Ahn from the Elohim group.<span>&nbsp; </span>The translation unit of the Elohim unit, they called themselves as the Council of Ahn.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">I remember one time when I was channeling, they were giving me so many mathematical equations and they were just laying out all this information for me.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just wasn’t getting that, I said, “I can’t understand this; I don’t speak that good math.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve got a minor in mathematics in college, but this was way beyond me.<span>&nbsp; </span>There were [formulas] all over; in my field, my matrix – they were showing me mathematical equations. <span>&nbsp;</span>It was beautiful, and I wish that I could have comprehended it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I told them “Can you send a translator?”</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">Since that point, we’ve been usually accessing the Elohim through the Council of Ahn; also, Daphne, when she started to channel the Elohim was accessing the Council of Ahn.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">There is one really nice thing that happens when I channel.<span>&nbsp; </span>I might be thinking of something worldly, like maybe paying a bill or something and then I sit down to do the channeling and the Elohim come in and they work with me, and they just have this loving energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>They just work with these things that I might be stuck on and we get them out of the way.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, everything feels clear.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, I go into the channeling.<span>&nbsp; </span>It lasts [during] the channeling. Sometimes [after the channeling] I’m a little bit dyslexic; like I might push the wrong button on my phone and cut me off the air.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">When I tuned into the scene, the thing I tuned into there was the scene where there was a conflict between the bird and the squirrel.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, I was trying to focus on a flower and my pineal gland muscles were so tired that I couldn’t get five feet from the flower and look at the flower.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would try, but my muscles were just over-taxed, like my muscles of my leg might get overtaxed if I was running too much.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">For example, the Ra group can disable weapons from going off; I don’t know if the Elohim can do that.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe they could but they don’t, because it’s in the hands of the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of their criterions, both groups, is they honor free will.<span>&nbsp; </span>They don’t intrude on our evolution unless we ask them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most people, if they knew such groups really existed, they’d be asking.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">What provoked me to pick this topic for tonight is this video that Daniel sent me.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the video, I sent the link out today; I suggest you look at it. There was some kind of signal that was sent into space some years ago with the idea of seeing if there’s any intelligence out that would answer that signal. <span>&nbsp;</span>It was a radio signal of some sort.<span>&nbsp; </span>Years later, there was a crop circle that seemingly answered the signal.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was a coded kind of pictograph on the signal they were sending out, and this crop circle appeared and it had the same pictograph on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was, adjoining to this pictograph, there was the face of a gray.<span>&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, there was another crop circle with another face of a gray and there was something that they were able to translate; I don’t know how they translated this.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m not an expert on crop circles. There is a lady I do know who is an expert; maybe I’ll have her on the show some time.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">For some period of time, they have been doing hybrids with humans.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you hear about abductions, it’s usually – one source of abductions – the grays are doing hybrids and creating hybrid babies with the idea of incarnating into them so their race doesn’t die.</span></p>
