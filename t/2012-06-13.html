<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>This cat is mean; he’s very territorial.<span>&nbsp; </span>I said “Claude, I’ve got to sit over there; that’s my chair.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He hissed at me; so this cat has a huge aura; he’s commanding the space right now, not me – the cat is.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>I just started the tape recorder.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve been having a conversation with Daphne; Daphne was getting profound when she was talking about her cat.<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn’t want you guys to miss it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In terms of the conversation, I think that – I don’t like to use the word “genius”; it’s even a hierarchical word.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everyone has their own unique gift.<span>&nbsp; </span>The big challenge is, for each of us, how do we tap into our gift and share it?<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the things I learned through doing these calls – this was a big lesson for me:<span>&nbsp; </span>I used to think being a public figure and you could say something in front of a group and everyone would change and forevermore their lives would change; you could do that.<span>&nbsp; </span>What I’ve learned is that: it’s one-on-one on one on one – each of us, one-on-one, has the ability to reach another person, one-on-one.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s through our sincerity, it’s through our passion, it’s through our care for that person that that becomes expressed and people get it.<span>&nbsp; </span>That changes people more than any kind of big gifts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gifts can be great; great musicians can lift the vibration of an audience, and great artists can lift the vibration of people looking.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, you can’t be in an audience and listen into a great band all day.<span>&nbsp; </span>Every day, we’re going to come across people, one-by-one, by one by one: it might be gardener, it might be the operator, it might be someone that answers the phone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Terry knows; she watches me.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve learned to never miss an opportunity to say something that lifts somebody’s spirits.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do it a lot through being funny, and I’ve learned not to censor myself; or worry about what people think.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know that humor – if you can make somebody laugh – you’ve changed the course of their day.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, every one has their own way of doing it.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not about teaching somebody something, it’s not about telling them about the shift, it’s not about talking about God – it’s about expressing your gift in your unique way.<span>&nbsp; </span>Figuring out what that is how to do it, and to have the courage to do it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have the courage, so that if you do it and for some reason it’s not accepted, then you don’t take it personally.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s better to do it and shift the energy of some people, and have one person be upset than to not do it.<span>&nbsp; </span>So many of us are just focused on that person who won’t accept us, so we miss the ten people that we could have shifted the energy on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The thing about it is: when you learn to do that it’s not like because you’re being goody-two-shoes; it’s not like you’re saying, “Oh good, I’m being of service.”<span>&nbsp; </span>You can’t do it without lifting yourself.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a huge reward; your day goes better, you feel better Somebody doesn’t like what you said, and it doesn’t matter because the people you reach, you reach.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ll give you a really good example:<span>&nbsp; </span>somebody could be working at the supermarket and they have a menial job.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re putting things in bags.<span>&nbsp; </span>All day long they’re thinking, “What am I doing here putting things in bags?<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m too good for this.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don’t they know I have a college degree?”<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re kind of going through their day and they’re not very uplifted.<span>&nbsp; </span>The people who they are putting stuff in the bags for – they all sense it.<span>&nbsp; </span>They all sense that person has an attitude and they put up with it because they gotta get their food in the bags to leave.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On the other hand, that person could be using their positioning in that supermarket to have warm smiles for everybody, to just say things that cheer everybody up.<span>&nbsp; </span>Oftentimes, when somebody does that – somebody will be going through the line – maybe it will take a couple of months and they’ll say, “Hey, I might have a better job for you.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Because, they look like they’re a pleasant person to be around.<span>&nbsp; </span>They end up leaving their supermarket job, and they do something that is – I don’t know if it’s better, but say it makes more money; it gives them more responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In today’s world, if you’re looking for a job, because people are so stressed out, because people are so concerned you need to have the abilities to do the job.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even more than that, your attitude is equally important – I won’t say more than – but, equally because a lot of people have abilities, but not that many people walk around cheering everybody up.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those people will always have jobs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When you look at your circumstance and you feel worried and you feel oppressed, you’ve got to turn that around.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’ve got to find a way to make yourself happy no matter what’s going on.<span>&nbsp; </span>You got reason to worry: you don’t have the money.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your money is running out; this is going on, that’s happening.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, if you keep running that, it’s like you’re running the mantra:<span>&nbsp; </span>“I don’t have any money; I’m broke.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m going to be on the street, I’m going to be on the street.”<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well, guess what?<span>&nbsp; </span>You’re creating it; it’s going to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.<span>&nbsp; </span>You have to transcend your circumstance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">What are we talking about here?<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re going to go to the higher realms of consciousness, the higher realms of awareness, it means doing it while you’re in a body.<span>&nbsp; </span>That doesn’t mean you can’t have a job; it doesn’t mean that you’re so spaced out that you can’t work and you’re in some kind of outer space zone; the job grounds you, the house grounds you.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m going to ask some questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you guys hear about alien attackers, you might be laughing, but that is a very serious issue; very serious for many people.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The Elohim, from your perspective, are what you would call celestial architects using laws of wisdom and laws of creating physical structures through the time/space continuum, originating with ideas outside of time and space.<span>&nbsp; </span>So questions which deal with wanting to understand one’s situation, one’s circumstance – the hows and whys of why things have befallen a person – these are best directed towards the Elohim.<span>&nbsp; </span>If one is looking for advice about how to handle, how to move through, what steps to take in a certain situation – of course, your will is always considered – these are better suited to the nature of the Ra group.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra has to do with actional ability; the ability to move energetic, kinetic forces of intent through the vibrational matrix in order to transmute; and, to rectify, to ameliorate, to bring into balance those frequencies and those harmonics needing adjustment.<span>&nbsp; </span>To sum up, roughly speaking the Elohim is the more feminine, the more receiving vibration; it is more the stronghold of vast, intergalactic libraries of held wisdom.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Ra group is more yang; it is more of the spiritual warrior, spiritual protector, spiritual guardian alliance.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would show a soul how to move through situations and how to best take advantage of those tools within one’s personal inventory in order to best deal with challenge<b>.</b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Connecting with Ra energy is extremely dynamic, kinetic, fiery, powerful, intentful, catalytic, cathartic, something of the warrior stance.<span>&nbsp; </span>If one thinks of your film “Braveheart” – think of watching an erupting volcano; lava flows, moving consciousness the way that molten lava moves – molten earth into new formations of continents.<span>&nbsp; </span>One is pure knowledge; the other is pure intent, pure action.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In metaphysical people, there’s this idea that crystals are transmuters of energy from this realm to other realms.<span>&nbsp; </span>People wear crystals, quartz crystals; there are crystal balls, there’s crystal swords, there are different crystals for different things.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Crystals</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> have a geometric structure – this is not Martin’s question; I’m not up to it yet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My question is:<span>&nbsp; </span>Is it the geometric structure of a crystal that allows it to be a portal into other dimensions?<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s for Terry.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Therefore, it can be a window for someone who has their chakras balanced with the aid of a crystal to harmonize with their own life, and to interface with others in their life and at the higher overtones to then resonate with the higher frequencies and the higher dimensions and make the individual more open to giving and receiving energy from the higher realms.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Also, the higher realms, the energies from the Elohim can activate a crystal and can use it as a window to move energy; helpful, beneficial energy to the individual.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I believe the quartz crystal is one of the most common – I don’t know all the differences of the other crystals – but, if someone was doing a meditation and they put crystals on their body while they’re lying down for example, would that help stimulate the energies through their chakras?<span>&nbsp; </span>Like, if they put a crystal on their heart chakra, a crystal on their third eye, a crystal on their stomach – would that be a balancing?<span>&nbsp; </span>Is there a specific technique you could recommend?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Is there a command that they prefer, or a prayer to ask for the highest good in relationship to programming a crystal?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Yes.<span>&nbsp; </span>A prayer can be created by the individual doing the programming and they can, in the prayer, ask for a purity within themselves as they program the crystal that they do not get any of their own interests into the programming so that it is done for the highest good.<span>&nbsp; </span>One can make this prayer a simple prayer, and they can also look within themselves and find anything that might interfere with the pure programming of the crystal and set it aside; stack it on the side shelf, so to speak, until they are finished programming the crystal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Any intent of a personal nature that wouldn’t be for the highest good can be set aside until the programming is over.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, in the prayer, they can ask for the highest sources from the highest realms of pure love and light to be with them as they and help them as they program the crystal.</span></p>

An answer to a question is</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">meant for the person asking the question and you have the</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">privilege of listening in because sometimes you can gain</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">insights from the answer. However, &nbsp;even though the</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">circumstances may be similar, do not merely assume the answer</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">applies to you.. This is not meant to replace seeing your</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">doctor, dentist or any alternative practitioner. &nbsp;Some people</span><br /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">get healings here, so you can be open to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
