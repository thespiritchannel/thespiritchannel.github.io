<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I used a different part of my brain.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’ve got a lot of great questions tonight. Let me just see if anything came in. We probably have more questions that we can handle.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">As you guys know, at least I’m starting to feel a little better. We have been terribly under the flu now for quite some time, since we got back from </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Los Angeles</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">. I might make a notice that we’re in Sedona. We booked the </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Sedona</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Creative</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Life</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Center</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;"> for three hours on Saturday, November 4<sup>th</sup> to do a presentation. If you’re in this area, you can put it on your calendar. I’m sure it’s going to be very exciting.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m looking at some of the questions. “Will our Sources be able to tell us who our next President will be?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">If they could, I wouldn’t want them to. Do you guys realize—who would want to be able—you think it would be great to know everything in the future, but it wouldn’t be great. If you could know everything in the future, if the future was totally mapped out, then why bother being alive? You might as well read a book, and it would be the book of the future. The thing that makes life an adventure that there are always these little factors that come in that are totally unpredictable.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">For example, I would say I’m kind of a wild card. Why am I a wild card? Because what we’re doing changes the future. One day I called up the producer at Coast to Coast. She happened to be in a good mood and talked to me for two hours, said “This guy is interesting.” Suddenly, I was on Coast to Coast.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I’d be willing to bet that because I was on Coast to Coast, not only are many of you here right now, but there are certain future events that will probably happen slightly differently, maybe majorly differently, I don’t know, because of the consciousness of all the people that are holding space because I was on Coast to Coast. That was like a little random fluke that could change lots of stuff. Life is filled with those kinds of flukes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">If you are going to try to predict the future based on the way everything is right now, you could never. Those kinds of flukes are outside of prediction in my opinion. There are things that happen as a result of synchronicity in the moment. You could always take it as it is right now and say, “If energy was going to be as it is right now, this is what is going to happen in the future”; except it doesn’t take into consideration the flukes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I want you guys to know that every one of you who is listening to these calls who is getting it, guess what. You’re a fluke-creator. You’re going to create flukes by holding this energy. If enough people are creating flukes, our whole planet will change. I don’t know if that’s possible; that’s probably asking too much. Maybe not too much for a hundred years, and if we had a hundred years maybe we could aim at that. Nonetheless, you can change your city, your can change your relationships; you can change your family.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Did you guys read some of the emails that I sent out today? People keep coming into our calls and having amazing things happen. Why is it some people have amazing things happen and some people don’t? Some people get bored, because we’re all different; we all have different potentials. Probably the people that have amazing things happen, that’s a good question. I don’t even know if I should answer that. I think I should ask that tonight; if not tonight, some other time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I know one thing is that there are many people who are already from other dimensions who got stuck here. Things don’t fit very well, and our calls tend to wake them up. They are really fast because they’re already from another dimensions, they got stuck here. They’re bored; nothing fits. They get it quickly and they have an epiphany quickly and something happens quickly. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Others of you are carrying karmic patterns; you need help in releasing your patterns. In fact, we’re going to have a question about that tonight. When you do, things can start happening quickly.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">This is our evening where you all submit questions and I ask them. Our Sources answer them through Terry. As most of you know, on all of our calls there are two modes of communication happening. One is through the telephone and the internet, so when I open my mouth you hear words. The other one is in the spaces, where our Sources are paying very close attention; they say they are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Of course, I can’t prove it, but I can feel the energy. They’re paying close attention to us; they’re paying close attention to you, personally. Can you believe that? You are being noticed.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">But, they won’t violate your free will. Some people say, “I hope they don’t know this about me, or “I hope they don’t know that about me.” If you think that, they won’t pay attention to you. They will know it, but they don’t judge you; they don’t care. The deal is, when they start paying attention to you, it starts feeling like energy is coming into your auric field. You suddenly feel this uplifted energy, and you start to feel balanced inside. The depressions of the day start to melt away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s when it starts for some people. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">For me, that’s what it feels like when I start to connect. It’s different for different people. But, that’s a pretty good feeling. It’s only being more of who you are; that’s who you really are. Everyone in this realm has gotten lost and lost the feeling of who they are because this realm is designed to trap you. So you have to be kind of clever to un-trap yourself.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I think we’ve made it kind of easy, because it seems as if just by showing up on these calls, over time you can start this process of un-trapping yourself.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Now I’m going to shut up, because Terry was late already. We got about thirty-five minutes. We’ve got a bunch of good questions here. You’re ready, Terry – yes?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light to surround and protect Terry, myself and everyone present. Any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth. Right now, we invoke a group energy connection amongst all those present while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One, to join with us. We create a protected space that only the positive has access to. Anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Are our Sources ready for questions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator. This is </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">the 24<sup>th</sup> of October, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">. We orient ourselves for just a minute. We make connection with each and every person non-linearly; not over the telephone line, not over the radio, but just directly in your space for those that wish to be contacted.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We are profoundly grateful for this opportunity to serve. Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. This is from Bogdan; it’s kind of a funny question. Actually, it has ramifications to it. His question is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Is there any benefit having Law of One books or Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce books in the same room where one spends a lot of time, for example:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>the bedroom?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">By the way, when you get your emails, Bogdan helps us send all our emails out; he lives in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Sweden</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;"> and he works in a candy factory. Every day he comes home and he’s helping build our websites. We’ve never met him; he’s just the greatest guy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">The question is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Is there benefit in having Law of One books or Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce books in the same room where one spends a lot of time? Maybe we could extend that question to the idea of having ritualistic objects: altars, crosses, whatever people may use in the way of symbolizing a connection to the higher realms.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. First of all, we handle the question as it is stated. The answer is yes. It brings into the room those frequencies which are connected with the sources of the writing. We are reminded of the comment of one woman who put The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce book by the bed and noticed the aura around it, and noticed the change of vibration in her room.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Similarly, if you have writings that are of a lower resonance; of a difficult negative source, they will bring the vibration of that negative source into the area. If you have negative writings, we suggest you isolate them out and do not keep them in your bedroom.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">When you then expand the question into objects such as crosses, then it is depending upon the connection of that cross with the meaning that is attached to it from the church or the source that has backed the cross or the object.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">So, the answer is: vibrations are brought in by objects or by writings. You may further expand your knowledge of this by the Japanese researcher who wrote, “Love” on a bottle of water and then froze the water. The crystals were beautiful. He wrote, “Hate” on the bottle of water and froze the water; the crystals were chaotic. This is an example, a broader example, of how words, how objects, how books and writings, carry and produce frequencies in their environment that change the environment.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Cynthia Izzo asks:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>How does one know if they have bad karma attached to them from a previous life and how can one get rid of it?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Being that everything is in the now, everything is riding with you in the now. Bringing bad karma and the patterns of it that it produces the results of it are there. When you have results that you do not like, then take a look at what happened just before that and see if there was a trigger; there was something that dumped you into a pattern. We think of many, you might call them circuits, that the mind can carry.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">For instance, one such pattern might be—we are not connecting this pattern with you, so do not take this to be your pattern—one such pattern might be: my legs are not long and beautiful enough. Then, when the individual comes across a trigger, a picture of a girl with long, beautiful legs, then it would dump her into her pattern: my legs are not long enough, they’re not beautiful enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then, it would trigger a whole thought process which would be like circuitry, like a tune playing over and over, words playing back over and over. I’ll never look good enough” might be one thing in part of the pattern.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">If you find yourself thinking with circuitry, with words that really don’t even fit the situation at hand but side-track you into another mode of thought, then take a look just before and see what the trigger is. Start to make a record of the triggers and these tunes that play over and over and the same words come up. There never seems to be progress concerning that issue. That would be one example of a pattern that kept coming up.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">An individual can have a lock-down pattern where in a certain situation they always react a certain way. Then they can meet another person who has a complimentary pattern, and they can feel at home and they can lock in person-to-person, pattern-to-pattern and can begin to act out the patterns together. They may take this as a sign the person is the right person; however, this may eventually, by patterns running mindlessly back and forth without any resolution, may stay within the framework of the problem and not move into resolution.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We hope this sheds a little bit of light on it. Is there anything further in that question that you wish to talk about, Wynn?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There’s an interesting thing that I’ve noted, that time is an illusion. When you talk about a previous lifetime, you’re actually mocking up an illusion. It would be as if you’ve been driving your car for a very long time and all your water hoses have gotten a little ratty, you can say, “Uh oh, my water hoses are ratty.’ They’re reincarnated water hoses and you have to go back in the past lifetime when they first got put on but in fact, you don’t. You just have to change in the present; everything is in the present. All your tracks from your past life are in your present. Its good identify what’s there; it’s good to identify that you need new water hoses. But, you don’t have to go back to when the car was manufactured, or to any other time, to try to change the hoses.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It’s like if you can take actions in the present time that are in a higher time track than your past lifetime, you’ll automatically shift the pattern. Somebody asked this question in Team Shift which I am going to bring up. The question has to do with, “How do you do things to shift patterns like that? What is an action that lifts the patterns from past lifetimes?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I was talking to my friend Jillian today. Jillian was one of my partners when I was younger. She and I would travel around the country together playing music and we had all these miracles and synchronicities. Then I did that myself, but it didn’t stick. I went back to having a lot of rough times and difficult times. I was suggesting to her that the reason that all that stuff was happening was because we were living very close to chaos. In other words, we would ramble around – we would be driving around in our VW bus and we didn’t know where we were going to end up next. It was all very spontaneous. Because of that, we had moved into another time track and things happened magically.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Could we have stayed in that track? Oftentimes, I tried to. I tried being on the road, but I couldn’t ground things from that track. I had to learn how to ground things into this realm as well as hold the track of chaos, because chaos, believe it or not, in my experience, is about as high as you can get. Chaos is before anything got started. So everything can be re-created from chaos. It goes through all the time tracks and then it comes down as a miracle down here.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. When somebody has a pattern, it is because they have a certain belief. The belief is a firm, fixed idea that they have that does not change. Whenever they run into something that triggers that belief, then whammo there is that belief acting in their life. The way to change the pattern is to change the belief.</span></p>

Next question is from Don Hanson in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Superior</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wisconsin</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">. He’s on the line tonight; hi, Don.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">This kind of connects with the first one, actually; it’s interesting. They’re different angles of the same question:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Many teachings I have read will reference the benefit of living in the now; that is to say, removing the clutter of past memories and the dream world of future imaginings where most of us spend most of our time. Can you speak about the power of living now and also provide some direction on how to achieve and maintain that awareness? Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. The now is made up of instances. When we look from our timeline to your timeline, we can create much more in a short period of time than you can in your realm. Thought and its fulfillment are more rapid in our timeline. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">In your timeline, it has to get all of the factors in alignment before the fulfillment of the idea happens. The closer you can get to the timeline of us, the Elohim, the faster your ideas can transform into reality. So, ‘now’ in our timeline is a faster happening than in your timeline because everything needs to come into alignment.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It is true; when you look into the future you may spend many hours worrying about finances and many hours worrying about individual happenings or possibilities. If you can move into the now and eliminate extraneous thoughts, you will have much more power towards creating a result by being in the now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">When you dream of the past, the girl that you may have loved and lost—we only give that as an example; we are not pointing to anything personal—then there is much time spent trying to work out something based upon the things that are not in the now. One can no longer work with those factors, although they try and try, or dream about it. So, bringing everything into the focus of now can help speed up one’s life and can enable one to move faster toward goals and be more efficient in getting there.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Can you still hear me?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I hear you, yes. I just want to be sure we’re finished.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It’s interesting that we’re having a lot of questions tonight about time. I think one of the reasons is that because time is speeding up. Some of you are noticing it; some of you are noticing it a little bit and are looking at how to catch that wave of time speeding up.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">There was an interesting comment made by our Sources on the grid healing on Sunday, I think two weeks ago. Ron and a bunch of our people on Team Shift formulated a question about that. I’ll read it:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">During our Sunday grid healing session, we were told that it is possible for us to get more done within our timeline here in third density by moving into your source timeline and borrowing energy, because in your timeline things move faster. Our Team Shift forum group asks if you can give us specific guidelines on how we can do this. How can we borrow energy from your timeline to get more done here and now? </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Then there’s a little reference to the exact quote from that call:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">“For those that can sense us and tune into us, we provide a model that one can use in the future. The speeding up of time can be useful, even in your daily activities when you have to get more done than seems possible within a short period of time. You can move into our timeline. Then, because in our timelines thing move faster, it is possible within your timeline’, borrowing energy from our timeline, to get more done within your timeline.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I’ll turn it over; is that clear? Is the question clear?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Thank you, Ron and thanks for putting things together to come up with such a good question.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. When you move into our timeline, there is a different phenomenon occurring. It is the phenomena of there being more time. You, in your timeline, when you move into our timeline, can feel that there is actually more time available. If you view both timelines together, your timeline can seem very, very slow in connection to our timeline.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We see it is as a sensing of time when you feel connection with us, with our realm. Then you, in the connection, also can feel the speeding up of events, of possibility of events. So when you are in your timeline and you wish to experience what this is like when you’re truly connected with our frequency, you can begin to sense there is more time between seconds. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry experiences it in the beginning of the call when she is thinking minute-by-minute that the call is starting and she needs to move into the trance state that she’s connecting with our timeline. Suddenly, there is an awful lot of time available before the invocation is finished. It is a sense, an ability, one can gather by the experience of being in our timeline and being in your timeline and experiencing the difference.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Does that help?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It helps; I understand it. I don’t know if other people do; I find that moving into other timelines is something that I’ve learned bit by bit. It’s a very subtle thing; it’s not like a technique. There are different things that I can do where suddenly things start moving faster. I can start a project, a creative project. At the beginning of it, I can feel all this resistance; I even put if off. As soon as I get in the middle of it, it’s like I can be with it for hours and hours. At the end I’ve actually completed something and it looks like it took forever to complete it and it didn’t. It happened pretty quickly. I got in the middle of the project and it started to flow.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">You may find that there are projects that you can get into that pull you into other timelines. It’s always an act of motion for me that makes things move; it’s not static. It’s not like I’m thinking, “I want to be in another timeline right now. I want time to move faster.” Its like: it doesn’t happen. There’s always an action that’s connected with the time moving faster.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Even coming into these calls it’s like I can come into them and think, “It’s going to be a two-hour grid healing. What am I going to do for two hours? People are going to get bored.” Then, I get in the middle of it; and suddenly we’re flying! Time is moving. You have to find out how that works for you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. There is also something that you may have noticed in your life, like when you are talking with another individual and it’s very exciting it seems like time just flies by. So, there are instances within your own life where it seems like a whole lot of things happened in a short time, but yet it was a longer time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. Tom Swan asks a question. Tom, I’m not going to answer your question, but I’ll mention it. “Please ask the Source how accurate is the Bible?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>How accurate are the Gnostic Gospels?” Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I make it a particular policy not to validate or invalidate other spiritual teachers, other spiritual works through our Sources. There’s no value in doing it. The bottom line about the Bible is: if you read it and there are certain things that jump out and make you take notice and make you feel better and make you feel connected to spirit, you’re on the right track.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">If there are things you don’t understand, that create fear, like we had a talk on the Book of Revelations, then maybe those are not the same things. The Bible has got many pieces of many sources in it and it’s been edited. There’s lots of truth in it and lots of stuff that’s been edited; you have to figure that out. There are a lot of people that have written loads and loads of material on the internet if you go look it up.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">This was a good one. I didn’t write the person’s name who asked it, but she said,</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">What should our focus be in the next few months?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Of course, right now we are in the middle of a dimensional shift; we’re in the middle of a lot of changes. We’re in the middle of a lot of energy. If someone wakes up everyday, what should their focus be? What’s their best focus?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. We say that day by day, your best focus is what brings you personal excitement, what you have passion about, what you wish to enjoy your time with. If you can work that into your job, if you can work that into what brings you energy back or money back, then that will be ideal.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">That is our answer: to focus on what you are excited about focusing about, because this has something to do with your purpose in being here.</span></p>

I think that it’s interesting. I saw a video of another channel who said that exact same thing. He said, “Follow your excitement. Every moment look at what the most exciting decision you could make is and follow that. That will bring you into your highest timeline; joy moves you into it.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Sometimes, following your excitement can be simple. It can be taking a walk in the woods. It can be making love with your partner. It could be …</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We have a great question from Roger Mack in </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Toronto</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">; we’re not going to ask it. He asks about intention manifesting reality. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We have Jenny asking about her mother again. Jenny, please ask next week; I’m going to ask that one time, it’s just that you’re one of those lucky people that have had the opportunity to ask thirty questions because you were here before we were so busy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I’d really like to give all the new people chances to ask their questions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I think we’ve asked a good part of the questions today.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The one question on intention:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When one focuses and has very high intention they can attract the synchronicities they need to propel them forward because their intention carries the vibration of what they wish to bring in. Therefore, they notice in their environment those things; their environment puts in front of them similar vibrations so they can then expand and move further into their goal and into their own growth.</span></p>

It’s </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">6:56</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">; we’ve got about a minute and half before we have to leave BBS.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Gijs, I wanted to do a quick silent healing for people.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I want to ask for that; then, if we all can for a little bit focus on Terry and her wellbeing; send her a lot of love.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’ll include that in our silent request. We have a healing list: <i>healing.intelligent-infinity.com</i>. I suggest that everyone go there once a day for a few minutes, put their hands in front of the screen, send loving energy to all those people who are going through hard times. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Put yourself on that list if you’re one of them. You can just go to your place on the list. We’ve been sending out how to get on that listen in our emails. I’ll send it again if you can’t figure it out. All you have to do is fill out a form and automatically you’re posted on that list.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Right now, take a moment. We have a beautiful group energy amongst us. Let’s let that energy come in though the top of our heads. Make pretend that our sources can read your thoughts, that there’s telepathic and that you can send something up to them and they’ll hear you as long as you’re willing to open up that way. It’s free will. Ask for what you need help in for the highest good of all concerned and honoring free will; ask. Let’s ask that Terry gets better.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It’s </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">6:58</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">. On that note, I’m going to thank everybody who is listening on BBS; thanks to everyone who is listening on our conference calls, thanks to all our volunteers; unmute everybody.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We’ll see a lot of you on Sunday and I really thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We thank you, for ourselves, for our Sources, for being part of this Grand Experiment in this realm on uplifting and connecting with these higher vibrations.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">So many of you that are sending me emails that it’s working for you are convincing me that it’s worthwhile that we spend our times doing this.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Thank you so much.</span></p>
