<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wynn:</strong> &nbsp;This is August 8th, 2011 and this is our Monday night</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">conference call. &nbsp;We were listening to your introduction, Terry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">– and you sound great!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The strange thing about these calls (is) that the people who are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">coming on the calls regularly start to take ‘it’* for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">granted. &nbsp;Not ‘take it for granted’ in a casual way, but they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">experience it. &nbsp;It is so unusual that when somebody is listening</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">for the first time, they can feel like an outsider – you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">not an outsider. &nbsp;The reason is (that) if we have it correct –</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">maybe we’re making a mistake. &nbsp;Maybe we’re just a bunch of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">mass-hypnotized numbskulls, and this is not the explanation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although if you listen long enough to the calls you’ll start</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">seeing that it would be hard to dismiss it by calling us</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">hypnotized. &nbsp;(There is) too much phenomena (and) too many amazing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">things happen on this call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If we are doing what it seems like we’re doing, we have a bunch</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of people in physical bodies and we have a whole bunch of beings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that are not in bodies that are on this call with us. &nbsp;There are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">these bridges between communications – Terry is channeling so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">she is a voice for them in the non-physical bodies. &nbsp;Many times</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">there are many things that come through Terry that are unusual,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that are phenomena that she can’t know, that is smarter than</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">her and smarter than me. &nbsp;(Also) awarenesses of how things work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that are incredibly insightful, and yet no one that I’ve been</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">exposed to has ever said it before.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The really unusual thing is that this intelligence, these beings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">in non-physical realms, have the ability to blend with us or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">maybe we have the ability to blend with them. &nbsp;It doesn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">matter which way it looks like, because in the course of these</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">calls there are energies that come in that many people feel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It’s kind of like we’re doing this call and we have this</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">whole team in other dimensions on the call with us and they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">really like to connect with people down here. &nbsp;They say it’s a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">rare opportunity/event/phenomena to make that connection with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">them, and not only does it feel good and feel healing, it is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">healing. &nbsp;When you make the connection they can then move through</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the energy of your body and things can shift in your body –</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">like, a depression can lift or a healing can occur. &nbsp;We do have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">many times (where) people call us or email me and tell me that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">occurred for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">We have this energy on the call and we have access to incredible</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">information about how things work, how they work. &nbsp;To a certain</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">degree what the future holds in store. &nbsp;I have at least one email</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">today from somebody that said they weren’t going to listen to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the call because they thought it was going to be fear-based</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">because the subject line was How to Handle the Economy that seems</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">to be falling apart. &nbsp;I suppose that’s only fear-based if</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you’re afraid of that. &nbsp;Of course, it is easy to be afraid of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that, because part of us is surviving in this realm, and having</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">no economy or having no money means struggle. &nbsp;It could mean</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">worse; it could mean starving to death I guess in a very</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">worst-case scenario which is not very pleasant. &nbsp;Does it help to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">make pretend that’s not going to happen?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don’t think so; I think there’s a saying that goes “Hope</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">for the best and prepare for the worst.” &nbsp;This thing about an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">economic breakdown has been in the works in my material even</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">going back to the David Wilcock/Edgar Cayce book, where in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">year 2000-2001 they were saying that things were going to break</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">down in this realm to the point where people had to barter with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">each other. &nbsp;What does that mean? &nbsp;That means there is no money;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that before bartering services or goods that they have accessible</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">for other services and goods that people have and they’re not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">relying on a system of money. &nbsp;That was back in 2000 and that’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">been quite some time. &nbsp;I think that to a certain extent some of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the good energy on the planet has been delaying things and they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">still delay things; it may delay things for quite some time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">But, according to the information of my sources, we’re on the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">verge of something. &nbsp;Then I read today, let’s just say for the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">past month, they’re saying “Look at the middle of August,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">look at the middle of August” from both Daphne and Terry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today, the stock market dropped 600 or so points. &nbsp;I think they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">said (it was) the biggest drop in 112 years. &nbsp;Wall Street was</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">going into a frenzy. &nbsp;The fact that this is falling apart is not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">just random; in particular in our country, we have a policy of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">printing money when we need it, and not worrying if there is any</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">gold or silver or anything to back it up. &nbsp;I don’t know exactly</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">how well this works, but I know it happens – when you keep</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">printing money and you’re trading with foreign countries and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">they are not printing money, that on some level their money has</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">some kind of backbone to it. &nbsp;Eventually, they’re not going to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">want to take your money because your money is just pieces of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">paper coming off a printing press. &nbsp;When they stop taking your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">money, (that) means that your economy starts to go into bad</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">shape, because you’re depending on the trade (with the) foreign</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">country. &nbsp;Maybe they take your money but they deal with it in an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">inflationary way: &nbsp;$2.00 is $4.00 etc., or it takes twice as much</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">money to pay the same bill. &nbsp;I am not an economic expert, nor do</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to be but I do know that there is one set of probabilities</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that’s very high that we’re going to go through a crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Our country has gone through crises before and probably no one is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">old enough, but many of you have read about the big crash of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">1929. &nbsp;If you go study that you would find that when there was no</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">money the government put people to work. &nbsp;They had people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">cleaning cities; they had people building things. &nbsp;They found</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">things that needed to be done - maybe it was busy work on one</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">hand, but it kept people with a paycheck. &nbsp;Our government can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">print money, trillions of dollars, so that we can go to war in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the Middle East. &nbsp;They can print money to bail banks out –</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">billions of dollars all over the place, and they’ve done that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Would they print money to put people to work?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is one thought that there are factions in our government</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that would like things to break down, that would like people to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">die or suffer. &nbsp;If you recall New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">hit, if you had read the newspaper at that time, our government</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">was acting in a way that was fairly illogical to me, because</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">there were people who were trapped there and there were people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">going in and out. &nbsp;There were people who wanted to go in boats or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">go collect somebody, and they were blocked. &nbsp;There was this</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">period of time, for so many days, that people were trapped and no</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">one was rescuing them; no one seemed to be delivering food and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that – do you remember that? It was very unusual because it was</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">in the paper and I asked myself “Why is that occurring like</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that? &nbsp;Why is our government not taking care of people?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then you start reading in alternative news and you find things</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">like chemtrails with funny things in them that when people….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">some people may not know what chemtrails are. &nbsp;In almost every</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">city and across the country, there are clouds – looks like</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">clouds, looks like jet-trails, but they’re not. &nbsp;They stay far</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">longer. &nbsp;In fact, sometimes there are a couple of airplanes in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the sky just criss-crossing laying down these tracks of all these</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">clouds. &nbsp;They’re called chemtrails. &nbsp;No one knows why they’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">doing it, it’s never been announced by our government. &nbsp;You can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">go look it up and you’ll find many websites talking about it;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">some of them where people are collecting particles and finding</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">very toxic substances in these things. &nbsp;Several times people are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">saying when there were (a lot) of chemtrails there was also an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">outbreak of certain diseases.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why is our government doing that all over and country and even</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">all over the world? &nbsp;Maybe there’s a reason that’s good about</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">it, but they’re not telling us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Terry:</strong> &nbsp;It’s probably a very costly program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wynn:</strong> &nbsp;Costly program – of course it is. &nbsp;If you start paying</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">attention to it, you find out that oftentimes when a certain</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">dignitary comes into town, the chemtrails stop. &nbsp;We’ve watched</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that pattern quite consistently. &nbsp;It seems as if there is a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">protection for those dignitaries and that they don’t want them</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">to be exposed to these chemtrails.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are many things, when you start looking at it, that in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">past we all thought – even me – that somewhere, someone cared</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">and if things are going bad someone would fix it. &nbsp;There would be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">a daddy; the government would be a daddy. &nbsp;If they were truly</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">benevolent, they would do that. &nbsp;They would do whatever they can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;The question is “Are they benevolent and do they really care,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">and what is the agenda for that?” &nbsp;That’s a whole topic which</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you can go listen to Alex Jones, you can read David Pike, you can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">do searches on the internet. &nbsp;Anyone who has ever studied 911;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">there’s something fishy about it. &nbsp;Go look up 911 conspiracy,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">read it yourself. &nbsp;There are too many things going on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If we have an economic crisis, what are the potentials for that?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">In Utah, the Mormons have been told for a long time to have a few</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">years of food supply in their basement. &nbsp;Somebody told me</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">they’re also minting their own gold bouillon so there’s an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">alternative currency. &nbsp;Other places are doing this. &nbsp;If you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">thinking everything is going to be okay, I hope you are right.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If things are not going to be okay, it’s far better to start</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">making plans right now on how you’re going to cope. &nbsp;Of course,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">one way of coping which readily comes to mind, is to buy a bunch</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of gold and silver and put it in your basement. &nbsp;Chances are, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">don’t have enough money to do that. &nbsp;Very few people do. &nbsp;If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you did, and you did that now you can’t tell anybody about it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">because you can’t trust anybody. &nbsp;They’ll come in, if</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">they’re having a hard time, and steal what you have. &nbsp;You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">damned if you do and damned if you don’t.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Somebody asked a question in a channeling one time “Is this a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">good time to buy gold and silver?” &nbsp;The answer was “On one</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">hand it is. &nbsp;But on the other hand, it could easily set you up as</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">a target. &nbsp;You have what other people won’t have.” &nbsp;They</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">said, in that channeling, the best security is community –</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">really good friends. &nbsp;People that care about each other, that can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">turn to each other if shit happens and can group-think their way</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">out of problems even if it’s required to leave an area. &nbsp;Do you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">want to be all alone and not know anybody? &nbsp;It’s far harder to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">find people at that point than it is prior to that point.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">People say “Well, this can’t happen.” &nbsp;If we look at the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">history of our planet, if we look at the history of our solar</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">system which we know a little bit of, there have been terrible</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">travesties that have happened, inhumanities of man to man. &nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">don’t believe when they were happening that one knew (or)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">believed it would happen. &nbsp;I don’t believe the Jews in Germany</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">believed that they were going to be massacred. &nbsp;I’ve read that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">there were even people saying this was so, and they didn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">believe. &nbsp;They had to opportunity to leave and they didn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was a planet called Maldek which exploded and became</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">asteroids. &nbsp;When Maldek exploded, according to Carla Rueckert’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ra material, not a single soul escaped. &nbsp;When I say ‘soul</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">escaped’, obviously everyone died. &nbsp;(Let’s just say it might</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">be true that) every soul on that planet, or almost every one,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">became a tangled mess, tangled up with each other. &nbsp;According to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the Carla Rueckert channelings, they were moved to our planet and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">came in as Neanderthal man which was engineered by the Ra Group,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">and that was finally individuating themselves, slowly but surely,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">over maybe hundreds of thousands of years. &nbsp;Hundreds of thousands</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of years sounds like a long time, but not by our sources</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">standards, because they’re not in time. &nbsp;They can create</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">long-term agendas and pull them off because they’re not in this</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">We had an interesting question come up last Wednesday or last</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sunday about karma and how one, little, wrong turn can lead to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">thousands of years of lifetimes working that out. &nbsp;You can be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pollyanna; and then you can look and say “If these things</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">happened this could be a treacherous realm.” &nbsp;Does it help you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">not to say that? &nbsp;Is that a pessimistic attitude? &nbsp;Maybe it’s a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">realistic attitude. &nbsp;What can you do?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">One of the things we know is that consciousness changes reality,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">and that if enough people have a positive consciousness and can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">hold the space, things take different turns because we’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">creating what happens. &nbsp;If you look at our little group and this</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">is a group that is tapping into that. &nbsp;Then, you look at the size</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of it and look at how hard it is to tell anybody about it and how</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">little support it gets and if this is one of those groups that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">provoke change, then you have to ask yourself “Why is it this</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">way? &nbsp;Is everyone going to run to this group when they are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">starving and surviving when survival is at stake?” &nbsp;It is far</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">harder to welcome people when they’re desperate, it’s far</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">harder. &nbsp;It’s like, this is the time to create associations,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">this is the time to make spiritual friends, this is the time to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">connect with people in our city. &nbsp;It’s not easy; you’re going</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">to have to be creative and clever to figure out how to do it and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">how to connect with the right people – not just anybody –</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">but, the right people. &nbsp;People with high intentions, people that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">are loving, and people that want the spiritual community with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">other people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">One of the things that’s not a bad idea is to buy food. &nbsp;Almost</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">every town has a 99 cent store. &nbsp;For $100, you can get 100 cans</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of spaghetti and it could probably keep you going for a hundred</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">days. &nbsp;I would guess that if things really and truly break down,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">then people are going to be trying to figure out how to get</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">themselves out of it. &nbsp;People are going to have a natural</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">tendency to try and take care of each other, and so having some</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">canned food gives you some breathing room. &nbsp;Also, water – water</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">doesn’t cost any money, even though tap water isn’t that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">great, just getting fifty gallons and store it somewhere and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">little iodine to purify it means you’ll have water on tap. &nbsp;If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you’re going to do this, if I was going to do this, I would</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">tell my neighbors “Let’s do this together. &nbsp;Let’s all get</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">some cans of food.” &nbsp;It’s just a good idea. &nbsp;That way,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you’ll have a bunch of neighbors that have cans of food and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you’ll feel a lot better. &nbsp;You’ll have friends that you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">not afraid to talk to if it gets to the point where people are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">eating that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if it never gets to that point, the fact that you did it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">starts to create community, starts to create care, it starts to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">create connection. &nbsp;It doesn’t matter whether you need it or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">not, you’re not doing it out of fear. &nbsp;Do you carry automobile</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">insurance? &nbsp;Well, you have to do that, but do you carry medical</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">insurance? &nbsp;You don’t do it because you expect to use it; you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">do it just I case. &nbsp;The things I’m saying can be looked upon as</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">insurance, insurance so that if something happens, you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">prepared. &nbsp;If you live in a really congested city you know</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">somebody outside of the city that lives in a small town or in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">country? &nbsp;Cultivate the friendship; ask them if anything goes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">really screwy if you can come over there. &nbsp;Maybe you’ll have to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">sleep in your car.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Preparing those things doesn’t mean you’re afraid; it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">actually can make you less afraid because you know you have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">options. &nbsp;It's good set your options up now, not later. &nbsp;We have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Team Shift, where people get to do calls every day and get to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">talk to each other and call in the light. &nbsp;Are you in Team Shift?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;You get in Team Shift and you’ll get to know four or five</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">people all over the country that have a high intent so if there</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">is an emergency and somebody has to leave the city, you have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">friends that you’ve been making in other cities. &nbsp;Again, it’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">far better to set these foundations up now when you’re not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">afraid, when you’re not up against the wall, than when you are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;People will trust it far better if you do it now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">We have our sources with us through Terry, and I thought I’d</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">get their take on some of this. &nbsp;We did do a conversation through</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Daphne a couple of days ago, and they said based on their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">probability vortices, this could be imminent. &nbsp;They said it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">didn’t mean it would have to be; it didn’t mean it couldn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">be delayed. &nbsp;The thing is, even if it’s delayed, it’s still</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">going to happen. &nbsp;I don’t see a way for it not to happen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">whether it’s sooner or later. &nbsp;Maybe it can be put off for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">years and I hope so. &nbsp;Maybe it can’t, and the stock market took</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">its biggest plunge today in 112 years. &nbsp;That’s pretty big.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Father Mother God we ask for the presence of the light to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">surround and protect each person on this call and any negativity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">be taken to the highest realms of light and transmuted for the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">highest good of all concerned. &nbsp;We see ourselves in the flow of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the planetary systems,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">through the energy fields of the earth, through us, through our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">bodies, through all our chakras, through our feet, and into the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">center of the earth. &nbsp;Right now we invoke a group energy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">connection, a blending of our energies while inviting those</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">sources that are positive, service to others, honoring the Law of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">One to join with us. &nbsp;We created a protected space that only the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Ra’an:</strong> &nbsp;We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Creator. &nbsp;This is Ra’an August 8th, 2011 Planet Earth. &nbsp;Earth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">is poised, many countries are poised, on that fulcrum point that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">could go either way. &nbsp;Right now what is needed are individuals in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the planet who are secure. &nbsp;Security does not mean money;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">individuals who are secure in their own beingness; it means being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">grounded, it means being centered. &nbsp;One of the ways one can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">center is to see themselves in the flow of energy from the center</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of the universe to the center of the earth – that they are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">within that space and are centered and that economic situations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">are not senior to things like being centered. &nbsp;Knowing one is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">worthwhile; one is valued which we value you. &nbsp;In spite of not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">having any hold; in spite of not having much of anything within</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the physical realm, &nbsp;one is still valued, one can still be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">grounded. &nbsp;Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wynn:</strong> &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;I want to ask some questions on behalf of all those</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">people that feel that sense of anxiety; that feel that concern</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">for their families, for their children, for their relatives, for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">their friends. &nbsp;How can we visualize the highest possible outcome</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">and be on the verge these potential breakdowns at the same time?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">What can a person do, in concrete action, to help them move</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">along?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Ra’an:</strong> &nbsp;The first thing is to be centered and have a sense of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">self-worth that is not connected to the economic system, for you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">came in without money and you leave without money.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">During the time of your travels in the third density you need</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">shelter and food and community which helps foster growth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, you are not a child of the third dimension, you are a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">child of the Universe and your role on Earth is one of attaining</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">growth, one of obtaining community as community leads to the most</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">growth, where one is communicating with a group of people that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">they can give and take and have affinity and community with.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">When one loses that which very often people can lose that in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">pursuit of money and material wealth, then their goal is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">lessened; they lose sight of who they really are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">To start with, to gain sight of the centering of who you really</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">are and that you worth while and that you are valued, then to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">reach out to the people around you that you trust and would care</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">for to set up groups, as within Team Shift. &nbsp;Groups of beings set</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">up of support where one person can support another. &nbsp;In the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">calling in of the light we come in and also can support</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">individuals within the group and help them be centered within</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">their own life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">To set up community, to set up individuals that one can give and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">take with, meetings - community meetings, get to know your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">neighbors. &nbsp;This can be very helpful and ultimately put the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">framework for rebuilding, as individuals as they get to know one</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">another, get to know what each needs, what their material needs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">are, and how they can help, what jobs they might do to be of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">service to another. &nbsp;This can all help.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wynn:</strong> &nbsp;You see in some cities, even in New York City, the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">neighbors are getting together and doing community gardens on</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">public land that wasn’t used for anything. &nbsp;Maybe it was going</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">to be built on but no one ever built on it. &nbsp;It’s a small</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">gesture, but it’s a big gesture because it gets people in a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">neighborhood working together.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I would say that there is going to be a lot of room for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">leadership in the days to come. and leadership being able to …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">e.g., obviously you’re anxious about the economy. &nbsp;We are all</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">anxious about the economy. &nbsp;It cannot be solved individually.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Let’s just suppose you tried to solve it individually and you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">took loads of money and you bought an island, I guess you could</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">do it that way. &nbsp;You could go to the island and no one could get</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">there and you’ll grow food for the rest of your life and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that’s going to be your life from that point.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of us don’t have that option; not even close. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you start being a voice of people’s needs; like in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">course of your day, keep it in the back of your mind. &nbsp;Think of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the people that you really do have affinity with and call a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">meeting and go to a local restaurant. &nbsp;Don’t do it at your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">home, because maybe you ought to decide who you would let into</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">your home and who you wouldn’t. &nbsp;Go into a local restaurant, go</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">in, ask for a meeting room; you might want to have dinner. &nbsp;Just</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">have people talk about their concerns, just be the facilitator</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">and let each person say, let them know that if things get into</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">trouble you want to have a group of people that connect with each</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">other that can help resolve it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you can hold the space, the spiritual space, even though</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you’re dealing with something that’s physical - you don’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">have to go into all spiritual stuff. &nbsp;They don’t have to know</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">about dimensional shifts and Ra and the Elohim, at that point.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just extend your loving to them. &nbsp;Knowing about all this stuff</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">– I’m going to pose this question:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are many people who become students of the shift; they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">listen to every spiritual person, they are knowledgeable</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">metaphysically – what’s the connection between having all</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that knowledge and actually qualifying for graduating this realm?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Ra’an:</strong> &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;One can have knowledge but knowledge is not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">useful unless it is able to be held, sensed, experienced - and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">put into effect. &nbsp;One might try, when one gets some knowledge, of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">thinking how one can put that into an experiential thing in their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">life, because without the experience the knowledge is dead.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wynn:</strong> &nbsp;Another really good idea right now is to start going and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">supporting the Farmers Markets in the area, and get to know the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">people that sell there. &nbsp;Those people have farms; they grow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">things and usually at Farmer’s Markets there are great</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">opportunities to meet other people. &nbsp;People that tend to go to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Farmer’s Markets tend to be more open than other people; I can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">say that because I’ve gone to Farmer’s Markets. &nbsp;It’s a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">great environment to meet people in your local area and to meet</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">farmers and to start supporting farmers by buying from them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">And, to get to know where their farms are, because at some point</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">personal connection with those people may not be possible. &nbsp;If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you’re their customer right now, then it’s a great</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">opportunity to make those connections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">One thing that I’ve done when I’ve wanted to open my energies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">up; this can work anywhere. &nbsp;That is: go to a restaurant, but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">don’t go to a busy restaurant – go to a restaurant where the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">owner is really going to appreciate your patronage, where no</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">one’s there. &nbsp;You have to pick your restaurant carefully</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">because you want gratitude; you don’t want his desperateness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">rolling all over to you, trying to convince you need their most</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">expensive dessert. &nbsp;That won’t work. &nbsp;Oftentimes, a restaurant</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">owner who is not having enough business will usually have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">gratitude for someone that eats there. &nbsp;If you eat there a couple</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of three times you get to know the waitress, you’re suddenly</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">flowing energy. &nbsp;This is all about flowing energy. &nbsp;This is all</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">about expanding your matrix, and you need to do something, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">need to take action and you need to be of service. &nbsp;Just going to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">a restaurant is a great way of getting your energy moving &nbsp;when</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">your energy is moving you’ll note that there are periods of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">time where you’re really depressed and you’re really</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">withdrawn and there’s other times where you’re really open.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Start paying attention to the open times, because when you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">open is the opportunity to connect and meet new people – not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">when you’re depressed and ‘woe is me.’</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are all these flows that each of us is doing. &nbsp;We’ve got</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">all these little spinning flows – one of them is depressed, one</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of them is withdrawn, one of them is lonely, one of them is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">broke, and another one is joyous and another one is open.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">They’re all moving in different providences of your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">consciousness. &nbsp;Learn to recognize them so that you can pay</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">attention to your own flows and take action when the flow is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">right.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">In other words, when you’re having a terribly depressed day is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">not the day to go looking for a job probably. &nbsp;It could be, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">could switch your day around, so there are no rules about this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">On a day that you’re feeling a little bit uplifted, that is a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">good time to look for a job, because you’re probably thinking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">“Oh my god I’m going to go look for a job; I’m feeling good</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">today and now I’m going to get rejected all day and at the end</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of the day I’m going to be depressed.: &nbsp;But, don’t think</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was interesting, Terry and I had the TV on the other night and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">we were watching Suzie Orman. &nbsp;She took this guy out of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">audience and he was having troubles because he had $100,000 in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">student loans and there was no way he could dismiss them, he</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">didn’t know how to pay them. &nbsp;He got a job but he was only</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">earning $25,000 a year or something. &nbsp;He felt like he was lucky</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">to have a job. &nbsp;She called him up and she said “Can you feel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that they were lucky to have you? &nbsp;What would it take for you to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">feel that they were lucky to give you that job? &nbsp;Can you feel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that? &nbsp;Can you offer enough to someone else that you can say that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">they’re lucky to have me in their life?” &nbsp;Not that they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">don’t deserve you, because they deserve you; but, you’re not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">lucky because of it, you’re making such a big contribution to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">them and you know it. &nbsp;And your self-worth goes up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">When you have a job there are little things you can do to invoke</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Grace. &nbsp;A job is something which is something which is an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">exchange; it’s an area of obligation. &nbsp;I work eight hours I get</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">$8 and hour at the end of the day I get $64. &nbsp;You do your eight</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">hours and you got your $64. &nbsp;You could be lawyer making $200 an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">hour but it doesn’t matter; it’s an exchange. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Find the genuine ways to do something extra. &nbsp;Not to give</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">somebody this, but just to do it. &nbsp;Sooner or later somebody is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">going to notice you. &nbsp;#1) When you get noticed you’re going to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">have job security. &nbsp;#2) You might get promoted. &nbsp;#3) You might</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">get a better job. &nbsp;If somebody is working as a super market</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">cashier and they just think they’re too good for that job -</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">they should be doing this, they should be doing that. &nbsp;Chances</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">are, they’re going to be stuck there for a long time. &nbsp;How</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">about if they’re a cashier and they are so cheery and they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">smile at every customer that walks by and makes them feel good.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">They’re a Wanderer; their job is to cheer people up and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">they’re in the perfect position. &nbsp;People come to them all day,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">and that’s what makes their day go faster because they’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">going to cheer everyone up that comes through that line. &nbsp;Before</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you know it, somebody comes through the line that has a company</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">and says “I love this person around my company. &nbsp;See how cheery</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">they are!” &nbsp;Before you know it, they got promoted. &nbsp;They got a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">good job.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are certain jobs that are totally skill-based; if you learn</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the skill, you can then get a job. &nbsp;But there are a whole bunch</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of other jobs that are trust-based, and if you can give off</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">enough good energy so people trust you… &nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I remember when I was in High School in downtown Philadelphia. &nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">was fairly young; I think I was fifteen or sixteen years old.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For whatever reason these guys had this electronic store called</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Soundtronics and I had the key to the store. &nbsp;I was there alone;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I would take money and they never even had a thought that I was</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">going to steal from them. &nbsp;If you can develop that kind of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">impeccableness, those kinds of people are harder to find,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">oftentimes, than people with skills. &nbsp;How many people have you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">heard about someone that went into business and their partner</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">emptied all their bank accounts out and left the country? &nbsp;Trust</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">is such a great quality to build, to be impeccable in your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">relationships with people. &nbsp;There is something that happens from</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">that. &nbsp;You become worthy when you’re impeccable; you put out</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">worthiness and people get it. &nbsp;Your words are slanted; you know</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you’re going to live up to what you say. &nbsp;You know you’re not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">going to cut corners. &nbsp;These are qualities that would bring you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">into spheres of people that you want to know.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Start now – it could be life and death in the next months or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">years - the quality of worthiness, integrity, trust. &nbsp;It’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">hardest to be in that space when things are tough and when</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">you’re desperate. &nbsp;It’s a lot easier to make concessions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I’m not saying to judge yourself if you do, because it’s not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">easy. &nbsp;What if you’re in the place where you don’t have any</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">money and you steal a loaf of bread so your children can eat?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Believe me, I would be the first to forgive you and I would</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">suggest you can be the first to forgive yourself if it ever came</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">to that. &nbsp;Do your very best to develop a track record of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">integrity; of keeping your word, being impeccable about your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">word. &nbsp;Prove to yourself that you can do it and it will change</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the energies you put out to other people. &nbsp;You will be able to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">assume responsibilities, and that will create long-term security.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For each person it’s going to be different. &nbsp;Let me ask our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">sources – what is the connection between integrity and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">connection to the higher realms? - trustworthiness and connection</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">to the higher realms. &nbsp;It seems to me it would be hard for a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">person who was devious to energetically connect. &nbsp;Could you share</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">why that is so?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Ra’an:</strong> &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;When an individual is in the higher realms,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">particularly, things move very very fast. &nbsp;The reach that a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">person takes is determined by the person’s own trust in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">himself, his own belief that the reach is going to be received.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If the person has been devious, then automatically that comes in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">- whether he is worthy of a good receipt from the other person, a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">good flow back from the other person. &nbsp;He may project upon the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">other person thoughts, as he has been devious that they are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">probably devious. &nbsp;As you are in the higher realms and are moving</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">at a very high speed, there is clarity of intent and purpose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is more viewing of how things really are with the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">person. &nbsp;If a person has been devious, that means that they have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">likely hidden their deviousness and as they get into the higher</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">realms and they attempt to communicate, they are unable to hide</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">their deviousness, and the flow between the two people is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">automatically corrupted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It makes it very hard if one is devious or is unethical, to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">interact, to give and take, at the speeds that are required at</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">the higher realms and at the crystal clear clarity that there is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">of thought between individuals at the higher realms. &nbsp;Therefore,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">individuals who are devious and criminal rarely make it to the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">higher realms.</span></p>
<p></p>
