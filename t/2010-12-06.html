<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Wynn:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Welcome everybody this is Monday, December 6<sup>th</sup>, 2010.<span>&nbsp; </span>My name is Wynn Free and I have my co-host <span class="il">Terry</span> <span class="il">Brown</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is our Monday night conference call where we explore topics and we have different kinds of things that we do on Monday.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s kind of a potpourri of different things and we’ve been doing this for a while.<span>&nbsp; </span>I guess what’s interesting about it is that we do live, on the call, conversations with an interdimensional source that <span class="il">Terry</span> is able to bring forth.<span>&nbsp; </span>Usually they ask for me to ask questions.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Of course, this has been going on for eight years.<span>&nbsp; </span>It started out with me in a room with someone else who said, “Those guys want to talk to you.”<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve brought it to the place where we actually do it live three times a week and have these conversations so that you can listen in and decide if it’s real, you can decide if the information is important, and probably most important of all these calls is that the sources that we talk to explain themselves in a certain way.<span>&nbsp; </span>They say they’re group souls that exist at the beginning of creation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now what does that mean, to exist at the beginning of creation?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Something that humans don’t usually think about is time – what is time?<span>&nbsp; </span>We take for granted time as being as being an absolute thing that we all are trapped in, if trapped is the right word, or that we exist in.<span>&nbsp; </span>Time moves at a certain speed, clocks are very aligned so it’s always the same time everywhere except for time zones – when it’s quarter after eight here it’s quarter after eight somewhere else and quarter after eight somewhere else.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we take it for granted that time is somewhat absolute.<span>&nbsp; </span>Except, that science - starting with Einstein - proved that time was not absolute, that it was arbitrary.<span>&nbsp; </span>I say proved, I think he proved it.<span>&nbsp; </span>What Einstein did in his equations was he indicated that if you moved fast enough, time would move at a different speed.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, if there was a vehicle, a space ship, that took off from Earth and could travel very fast, approaching the speed of light, then the people on that spaceship when they returned to Earth, would have not aged in the same way that people on earth had aged.<span>&nbsp; </span>For them, they may have been gone for a few hours, and time would have been going on on earth for maybe eighty years or sixty years or who knows what.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">If that’s true, that opens a whole new way of thinking about time.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 3-D science, in third dimensional science, which is the science of this planet, it’s generally accepted that nothing moves faster than the speed of light, which is 186,000 miles per second.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s pretty fast.<span>&nbsp; </span>What if, in other dimensions, time moves faster than the speed of light?<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t know if you can prove that scientifically, so we can postulate it since we don’t know all the answers.<span>&nbsp; </span>I believe our sources would say that there are dimensions existing that move faster than the speed of light.<span>&nbsp; </span>Where we exist right now in our physical bodies we may be experiencing time in 3-D, but around us, right in our space right now, there are dimensions that might be moving at different timelines.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now we’re not talking about a physical object moving, we’re talking about a dimension that moves so fast.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re in that dimension, if you have a consciousness in that dimension, you don’t experience yourself moving fast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">For example, if you were in an airplane that’s moving very fast, when you’re on the plane you don’t experience yourself as moving fast until you look at a reference point, which would be the ground, and suddenly you can see, “Oh my God there is the physical earth and look how fast I’m moving.”<span>&nbsp; </span>When you exist in another timeline I don’t imagine, no matter how fast it moves, your experience of that timeline doesn’t seem fast unless you look at something that’s moving slow.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have a whole universe, and we see the universe in terms of third dimension and physical objects, but there are many things in the universe that we can’t see and so we have to speculate because we are talking to a source through <span class="il">Terry</span> that early on said they existed outside of time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their exact words were that they could jump in and out of time like we would jump into a swimming pool.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can somehow slow themselves down to move into our dimension, and when they do we speed ourselves up and we experience something.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those people who have been on the calls regularly many of them have had this experience of this unusual energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, one of the things you might notice on these calls, some of you, is how quickly time passes when we’re on a call.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even when it’s two hours on our Sunday grid healing, an hour and a half, there’s an experience of time moving fast.<span>&nbsp; </span>My thinking is that when someone is in this realm and time moves fast, part of their consciousness actually moved into a dimension where time was moving at a different rate than this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>The way we experience that is by time moving fast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">On the other hand, there are times in your life, everyone has had these times, when we experience time moving slow.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, if you’re very lonely, time moves slow.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re in pain, time moves slowly.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we have this subjective reference point of time moving at different speeds, and I’m making the hypothesis that part of that is due to our own consciousness accessing other dimensions and making our perception of time different.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">In these conversations that we have with our sources, we have the ability and we ask questions about how it is to be them and how they look at our universe.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the past, many times I’ve asked questions and part of it was because I was curious and part of it was because I was testing the whole communication – and seeing how they would answer something, particularly when it was something that was so far removed from <span class="il">Terry</span>’s ability to answer that I would get the answer and say, “That couldn’t possibly have come from <span class="il">Terry</span>.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Now did I know it was the correct answer?<span>&nbsp; </span>No, didn’t know.<span>&nbsp; </span>I knew it was an answer and I knew it made sense.<span>&nbsp; </span>There were aspects of the answer that made sense.<span>&nbsp; </span>But you have to leave the question begging and everyone has to decide “Is that a correct answer?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">One of the pluses in hearing these kinds of understandings that seems to work is that many of us, many of the people who are attracted to this material, have had previous experiences in other timelines; they’ve existed in other timelines.<span>&nbsp; </span>They made a choice to come into this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of them probably out of curiosity to see what it felt like to be here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Others to be of service, which is what the Ra group calls ‘wanderers’ and the Elohim group calls ‘starseeds’.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’ve chosen to take incarnations in this timeline, knowing that once they were in this timeline they wouldn’t remember that they made that choice and they would have to figure it out or something would have to wake them up.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes this information is particularly compelling to a person who had done that, because if a person had come into this realm from another timeline and chosen to be here to volunteer then they might have the potential - if they could wake up to the timeline - to bridge the energies of those timelines into this realm which would then enliven the vibration of this realm which is what our sources do when they say they project love light energy into this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, those are just words except many of you have had that experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, for many of you it’s becoming more and more ordinary to say, “Oh I can feel that energy, I can feel that frequency.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Today I had picked a topic and I picked a topic because actually the topic had come up in conversation.<span>&nbsp; </span>I never tell <span class="il">Terry</span> what I’m going to be asking, so it will be interesting to see if the structure of her own personality system, her own mental structure, can bring through information on this topic.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know there were times when I’ve asked questions to <span class="il">Terry</span> and they said, “Oh God we wish Daphne was here because Daphne has a better vocabulary.”<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="il">Terry</span>’s been getting pretty good and somehow these things manage to come through.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t know if we should say the topic now or should I do it after I call in the light?<span>&nbsp; </span>What do you think, <span class="il">Terry</span>?<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif=""><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Wynn</strong>:<span>&nbsp; </span>Over time, we got a bit of information about Betoule that maybe was indicative of why they did that.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because Betoule is an artist and she’s also a student of something called ‘reconnection’ which is a technique by Eric Pearle.<span>&nbsp; </span>A couple of years ago I was at a fair and there was this woman next to me who was doing reconnection on people.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was kind of like, I guess you could put it in the same category as Reiki or energy transference from one person to another, but it’s a very high kind of energy transformance and balancing.<span>&nbsp; </span>As this woman was doing this on people that would walk by her booth I could feel her energy and she could feel my energy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">In a channeling in a question that we did a couple of weeks ago, they had said the guy that started this reconnection was – I think they indicated he was like an Egyptian initiate connected to these energies, connected to the Law of One and that it was just a different expression of the same energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Betoule was a practitioner of reconnection so that she had a pretty high vibration which they probably picked up like a clear signal and it’s why…<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">That’s what we’re doing on these calls, we’re creating the space for everyone on the call to – if they want to be found, if you want to be noticed – it’s probably easier to be noticed because we expand the energy on these calls and people feel it.<span>&nbsp; </span>On that note, I’m going to call in the light and when I call in the light that’s just my little invocation for creating a oneness energy, for creating a multi-dimensional consciousness of everyone on the call.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, it’s free will so you can just listen with your mind and oftentimes when people first come into these calls that’s their emphasis – they want to try to understand in their mind.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s an important part of the process because we’re opening ourselves up to energies, and your mind should make the decision that you are comfortable with opening up to those energies, that it feels safe and that it feels positive.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some people intuitively get that right away and other people take some time to say, “Okay I’m open,” because the energies are not going to connect with you until you’re open.<span>&nbsp; </span>You have to come to that place out of your own choice, because of the free will clause, the way they operate is they’re not going to impose on you energetically and maybe they even can’t do that, there has to be a reaching back on your part to connect with the energy.</span></p>
