To those of you who are listening on the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">replays or on the downloads, one of the things that goes on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">before we start these calls is everyone who is actually on the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">call live, signs in. As they sign in there is this phenomena that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">happens where people who are on the call regularly get to know</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">each other. Its not like they know each other in a personality</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sense, some may but most of them don't, but they start</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">recognizing each others’ energy signatures and each of us has</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">an energy signature whenever we are talking or being anywhere,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">our unique frequency is somewhere in the mix.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">So on these calls, what I believe we are doing is creating a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">group energy matrix. As people say hello, that matrix starts to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">form and the energy starts rolling in and it happens before we do</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">anything formal.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">In fact, it’s very interesting, we were on the call on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Wednesday and if you weren't on the call, I suggest you listen to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the replay because it was an unusual call. I had announced</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">because of so many things happening in the world, that instead of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">doing a question/answer call as we usually do on a Wednesday</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">night call (we did a grid healing kind of call).&nbsp; Well, I didn't</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">know what was going to happen. We did a different format of a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">grid healing call and Daphne was on the call and Terry was on the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">call. I took a shot and asked Daphne to bring through a message.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">At first I thought something was wrong because all these strange</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sounds were coming through her. They were very guttural and (it)</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">was not very linear, but as she was making these sounds there was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">an extraordinary amount of energy which I think some of you felt.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Then Terry came on and through Terry they said that Daphne was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">actually grounding energy beyond words through the sounds she was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">making. There was no doubt that the energy on that call was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">really, really high. At the end of the call, I usually say</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">goodbye to everybody, but nobody was talking. It was one of those</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">speechless moments. So listen to that call because that is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">probably one of the highest vibrational calls we've ever had.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Terry, are you on the line? Do you want to make any comment about</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that call on Wednesday?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> What was coming through was Daphne was so exterior to her</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">body, she was grounding so much energy, that she had become so</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">large that she had trouble bringing words in because she was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">bringing in so much energy and grounding so much energy from the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">higher realms and that's why the energy went really high on that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">call. It was a beautiful energy.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I was just looking at the energy in the space. That is a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">really good reference point, to look at the energy in the space,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">look at what is happening in the space. When I spoke to Daphne</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">afterwards she said that the words were creating duality, just</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the fact of speaking, just the fact of translating things into</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">words.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Gijs was just telling me, he observed that when you call in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">light- (Gijs sometimes calls in the light for us) and you leave</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">spaces, there is a lot more that happens. Even notice when I'm</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">talking, I leave spaces. And the energy is in the spaces. So when</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we go through and put things into the light, maybe as you speak</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you might pay attention to the spaces that you are putting out.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">You might feel a little self-conscious at first. See if you can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">feel the space in between the words, because everything is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">happening in the moment. I'm going to be making everyone feel</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">self-conscious and it may feel a little weird to you, but let’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">all pay attention to how it feels to put the voice on top of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">space. See how it feels to have the voice emanate from the space.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">You see, I could talk like this---(Wynn speaks very fast---but</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there are no spaces) or we could put things in the light--(Wynn</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">speaks very slowly and puts spaces between his words)-- I would</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">like to send the light to each and every one of you on this call,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that this energy radiates through you, understanding that the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">light is you, you are a piece of the light in this realm.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">So, in any case when we do this, as we will momentarily, practice</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">leaving space because what's in space? The space has the energy.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The space has the sources. The space has the expanded hologram.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Then start applying that during the week. Start watching spaces.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Years ago I think I was tapping into this phenomenon of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">spaces and I wrote this kind of funny song called “Dig the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Spaces.”&nbsp; (Wynn recites the song). I had no idea at the time</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what I was tapping into. Intuitively I was starting to see things</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in spaces but I wasn't doing any inter-dimensional contact; it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">was just in my own consciousness when I would travel around the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">country and observe people and play music everywhere.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Now I am going to unmute everybody and try to be fast today</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">because, particularly with doing these workshops at the end</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we’re going through a long period. For all of you who are on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the replays, why don’t you listen and see how well everyone</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">works with spaces.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Gijs:</strong>&nbsp; Wynn, could you clarify what you were saying earlier about</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">seeing the energy in the space?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> You know, it's hard to put it exactly into words, because</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we are talking about something that is beyond duality and trying</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to understand it intellectually. We come on the line and feel</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">these energies. If I tried to explain it, my mind doesn't</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">understand it. All I can say is, “Hey, when we do this, this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">works,” and try to explain it the best way I can, and we create</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">a group energy matrix. We blend our energies and that matrix</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">exists in the space, not in the words. So the words are just</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">something that drags our dualistic minds along and the energy</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that's in the space is what's really happening.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Gijs:&nbsp;</strong> You mean time space?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Yes, time space. I say all that and it sounds like I know</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what I'm talking about but I don't.&nbsp; That’s the duality of it.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; A musician will say that it’s not the notes, but the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">spaces between the notes. We live in a dichotomy, we live in a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">dualistic universe, so one of those dichotomies--besides</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">day/night and male/female--is on and off and one has to exist</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">without the other. So you are creating a motion of energy and in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the spaces, is where it can be found. (A dog barking can be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">heard)</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; And that dog in the background agrees. (Laughter) The real</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">bottom line to all this is you can't understand it. Whatever we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">say, it may sound like we are really smart and understand it, but</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you can't. Terry asks me after we do these calls, “Did that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">really happen?” There are no experts here. The only thing that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">is possible is to get your mind out of the way. So when we talk</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it creates enough rhythm in the matrix that we say the right</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">thing so that your mind moves back and the energies come in. And</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you all can learn to do that. You are learning that on these</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">calls and of course we have so much expertise from other realms</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">going in the spaces.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">What brought that up was when Daphne started doing what she was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">doing, first I got a little concerned and thought, “Oh, oh</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">what's coming through here,” and then I felt the energy and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">then Terry explained it and I thought, “Yes, that sounds</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">right.”</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">So, with all of us, it’s learning to experience the spaces.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Don't try to understand them. Your mind comes in. Learn how to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">navigate around the spaces, because I'm sure it's in the spaces</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that the miracles exist, that we access the other dimensions,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">where we heal ourselves when we open up to the frequencies of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">higher realms. We come on these calls and it is becoming</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">commonplace.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">When you put out something into the light remember speak slowly,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">watch the space in between the words, and let’s see if we can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">feel a difference.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Gijs from Magalia, California</strong>:&nbsp; I have 2 requests.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">One is I saw that at your old school at Berkeley the students</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">were occupying one building and there were confrontation with the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">police and (the students) were protesting against the way</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">education is progressing over there. I want to ask the light to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">be sent in that direction and for a peaceful solution of this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">conflict.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">And secondly I want to ask for the love/light to be sent to the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">lost souls, the entangled souls, which happened a long time ago.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I remember you saying that in Sodom and Gomorrah that souls got</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">lost and if there are more soul entanglements that they will be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sent love/light and that they can be untangled. Thank you.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you and next</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Carolyn from Davis:</strong>&nbsp; I would like to ask for love/light for all</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">those who are in service for others whether they are working on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the environment or they are warriors in Libya or they are working</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">for organic foods, or are doctors and nurses, Michelle and Barack</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Obama, and all those who are helping him (Obama), and all those</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">who are in service to others, I would ask for love/light for.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Jean:</strong>&nbsp; I would like to put Wynn and Terry and Daphne and David</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Wilcock in the light for all the work they are doing, and I would</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">like to put all of you on the line in the light for your work of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">holding the energy and space. Thank you</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Michael from San Diego:&nbsp;</strong> I would like to put the energy of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">creative expression in the light and also the energy of freedom</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of protest, freedom of speech, and freedom of the internet, and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to protect our ability to express ourselves freely.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you. Speaking of freedom of protest, you may not</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">know this as it hasn't been in the media, but you can search for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it on the internet, but right now and for the past week or so</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there has been a bunch of people camping out on Wall street</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">protesting the big banks and how money flows from this country</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">taking it away from the middle and lower classes, how they are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">being exploited. Look it up on the internet because they have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">actually been allowed to be there up until now but the media is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">scared to put it on, or perhaps they have instructions not to put</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it on because they are afraid a million people might show up.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; Wait until 30 million people march on Washington. See</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">how they could avoid that.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Zoe in Sacramento:</strong>&nbsp; Along those lines, I would like to put into</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the light the world economy, and the new economic arrangements</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that need to happen so that all people have a fair share of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">things that uphold their lives and will come into play in a way</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that is just for everybody.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I'd like to put into the light any negative repercussions,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">from this information you might not have yet; and this is another</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">thing you can look up on the internet, but late in August,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">reports came in from Russia that there were two explosions; they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">called them nuclear explosions, in underground caverns that were</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">created by our government and around the country there are many,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">many underground caverns that are more like underground cities</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">where people can live and the theory is that if there was a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">nuclear holocaust, the elite could go underground. There is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">electricity, they can grow plants and food, and they can stay</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there for a few years. Having this as a backup could give certain</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">people the incentive to/or the possibility of creating a nuclear</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">holocaust. The two explosions, according to reports were reported</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">as earthquakes. When people analyzed the seismic profile, they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">were not the profile of nuclear explosions, they were the profile</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of some other kind of explosion. Nonetheless, in the alternative</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">news area, there was the possibility there was going to be some</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">kind of retaliation, as a sign to whoever did these explosions</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that the elite could not control, and they would do something</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">horrible. So, I would like to put total obstacles to anything of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that nature and total disabling of any plan for retaliation on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">any level that any weapons not work, that people change their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">minds and that synchronicities occur to block that. I'd like to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ask right now for total protection from anything of that nature</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">so we can continue to evolve as a planetary group on earth.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Jan from Ontario:</strong>&nbsp; I would like to put self-love and non-judgment</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of self and others in the love/light.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Jere:</strong>&nbsp; I would love to put that everybody’s chakras would be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">open as much as possible within their free will and for the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">highest good of all so everyone can be more one with their true</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">selves and in harmony with all of existence, and shine more light</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and be the love they are. Thank you</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Edna:</strong>&nbsp; I would like to put into the light all our team shifts.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Thank you.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; If anyone on the line doesn't know what team shift is,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">those are little groups of 4-5 people that meet daily, as much as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">each person can, for a short period, say 10 minutes, calling in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the light just as we do here. It gives people an opportunity to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">meet each other and have more individual focus of putting their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">own issues in the light. Many people have had great, great</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">results as a result of their participation in team shift, so if</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you want to participate go to ...www.teamshift.messageaday.net.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Next.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Lisa in San Francisco:&nbsp;</strong> I would like to put into the light the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">idea of anyone who has pets, or animals living with them that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they raise their consciousness towards understanding what the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">pets need and not project their humanness onto the pets and also</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I would like to put my kitty, “Déjà Vu” in the light as he</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">just crossed over day before yesterday and he was 16 years old</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and I want to put him in the light. Thank you very much.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Zoe in Sacramento:</strong>&nbsp; I'd like to put into the light all artists of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">every kind around the world that they may be given everything</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they need to bring forth the various levels of love through their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">work to the general public.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Gijs:&nbsp;</strong> I know that Arielle had a request. Arielle, can you unmute</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">yourself? She is travelling the country and she is currently</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">somewhere that she wants to send love/light to some kind of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Stonehenge I believe. She is from Sedona, but I don't know where</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">she is currently.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn</strong>:&nbsp; I'm not sure we can do this request as we don't know where</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">she is. It’s a replica of Stonehenge in England, but she is not</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in England. She is somewhere in the country where these replicas</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">are. I'm not sure that Stonehenge is positive in its original</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">formation. So let’s just send the light to Arielle where ever</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">she is, to bring love/light in a non-dualistic unconditional way</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to her environment. Okay? And we will leave it at that.&nbsp; Next.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; I would also like to put in the light all those who are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">developing new technology that would mean the new and clean and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earth friendly forms of energy and that this information be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">allowed to be freely disseminated.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Carolyn:</strong>&nbsp; I would like the whales and dolphins put in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">love/light and also the coral and the plankton which is basic</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">food, and icebergs and glaciers and the polar bears.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Trish in Florida:&nbsp;</strong> Well, just about everything that I wanted to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">be put in the light has been put there so I want to double that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and ask for light for my grand daughter who is 18 and has been</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">really rebellious and horrible and the family is just sick of her</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and to heal the whole family and the other family that is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">involved and please heal my grand daughter. She won't go to a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">therapist, she just turned 18 and you can't tell her anything and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it has been really hard on everybody.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> We've got to keep it for the highest good.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Trish:&nbsp;</strong> I do, for the highest good of all. I was just getting</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">emotional so I had to stop. I pray for them too. She had a plan</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that she totally did a complete 180 on; and to just heal her,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">whatever it takes, for the good of everyone. (Very emotional)</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Gijs:</strong>&nbsp; My love goes out to you and your whole family.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Tina from Decal:&nbsp;</strong> I am placing in the love/light for the highest</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">good of all, for any situations that affect human beings and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">mother earth that may be unknown presently. And when I say this,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">there are many upheavals taking place around the world</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">economically, politically, socially, places like Guatemala that a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">lot of times we just don't know about. They go unreported or the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">information may be distorted. Also, I'd like to place in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">light the fires in Texas, and other places experiencing drought,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">fault lines around the globe including the New Madrid fault in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the Mid-west where liquefaction and sinkholes are a concern. I'd</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">also like support for grounding and holding of the space and I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">would like to place in the light, gratitude and appreciation for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">each breath we take that we see the many blessings and joys that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we do have.

Thank</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Zoe:</strong>&nbsp; Protect those animals that are being tested.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; And I would like to put the seed of what we do on this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">line to grow into a tree, to be an anchor that grows energy into</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the collective and creates an opportunity for transformation for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the entire planet that we are holding a model here for the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">future. Not meaning just us as there are other people doing it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">too, but just us because we are the ones HERE doing it and that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we can be used to the greatest extent possible for clearing the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">path, for protecting from the negative, for allowing the highest</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">energies to manifest into this realm for all those who would wish</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to access this.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Wynn then directs us through the visualization.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The universe is one energy and each of us is a subdivision of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that energy and oftentimes we don’t experience ourselves as</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">part of that energy, we feel separated and we reach for the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">connection.&nbsp; So right now, we’re going to make that connection.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;We’re going to make it just through our intention to do it. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">The earth is part of that energy of all that is and we as humans</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have lived on the earth for many lifetimes.&nbsp; The earth has hosted</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">us.&nbsp; Much like if you have a family and you have a dinner and you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">invite someone over.&nbsp; You are hosting your guests.&nbsp; They come and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">they are in the energy field of your family.&nbsp; So does the earth</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">host us and we are always in the energy field of the earth and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the earth is alive.&nbsp; It has a consciousness.&nbsp; It has awareness. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">As we relax and we put our feet flat to the floor, we’re going</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">to ask the earth to visit us.&nbsp; Of course, it’s always visiting,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we’re always there.&nbsp; We’re going to just put our awareness on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">that energy as it comes through our feet, and through our legs,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">through our calves, through our solar plexus, through our chest,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">through our neck, through our heads, up through the top of our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">head and moving our energy, our attention above our head—you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">know, these are energies that were always there but we can’t</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">pay attention to it all. We can pay attention to one thing at a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">time--so we’re just focusing our attention above our heads.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">We’re moving higher, up to the ceiling surrounding the room</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">we’re in. Just use your imagination if you’re not feeling it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">directly, through the ceiling, through the clouds, through the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sky, traveling through space, traveling through time, moving</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">through our past lifetimes, coming to the place where we all</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">blend, where we merge, never loosing our individuality,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">simultaneously being one and being separate.&nbsp; We invite our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">sources to join us in that place of oneness.&nbsp; There is a moment</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">for every being where we individuated ourselves from all that is.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">&nbsp;There was a moment when the Elohim individuated themselves. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">There was a moment where the Ra individuated themselves.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">So we’re going to the moment of individuation and we’re at</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the beginning of time, at the beginning of space&nbsp; We’re at that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">place of innocence, a new-born baby, energy baby, prior to all of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">our past lifetimes, prior to all of our karma.&nbsp; In the place of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">grace, in the place where everything recreates itself at the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">moment of intention, and when we’re in this place we create our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">intentions always for the highest good of all concerned; always</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">honoring free will; learning to shine like the sun.&nbsp; The sun</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">doesn’t decide who it’s going to shine for.&nbsp; When it shines,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">it shines for everyone.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">And we bring the space back down, down through all the timelines</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and as it comes back down it fills in the gaps and the spaces and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the distortions of our field, our hologram. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Finally it comes back through the top of our head and we are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">linked to all that is.&nbsp; We are linked to source.&nbsp; We have always</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">been linked to source but for many of us, we didn’t know it, we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">forgot it.&nbsp; We got compressed in the veil.&nbsp; We got contracted. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Move that energy down through our bodies.&nbsp; We can direct it. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">We’ll go quickly and in particularly we’ll center ourselves</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">in our heart.&nbsp; Take a look inside yourself and see if you can see</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the patterns that block you.&nbsp; Look in your heart, look for areas</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">of unforgiveness and judgment.&nbsp; Think of those times in your life</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">where you were hurt and collapsed and contracted.&nbsp; Somebody did</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">something to you.&nbsp; We all have them.&nbsp; Let’s forgive them right</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">now.&nbsp; Forgive ourselves and release these blocks in your heart. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Think of something you’ve done to someone else, something</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">despicable, something hurtful, where you may have expressed</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">revenge. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">You know the world is a reflection of us.&nbsp; The negative exists</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">because of us.&nbsp; We give it the power, so let’s take the power</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">back.&nbsp; The more we forgive, the more we release.&nbsp; We’re not</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">doing it not just for ourselves, but for everything you’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">plugged into.&nbsp; So the responsibility here is to clear yourself</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and then everything that’s plugged into you--your family, your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">friends, your husbands, your cities, all starts to shift.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">We go through our solar plexus and our genitals and clear the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">energy, all the way through, through our legs and back into the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">earth.&nbsp; Experience that feeling of being your individual body</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">connected to all that is, the celestial realms above your head</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and the earth below you.&nbsp; It’s all you, it’s all us. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Right now, while you’re in this space, right now connected to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">the things you’re connected to, bring it into this space.&nbsp; You</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">can choose what you bring in--your family, your friends, your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">wife, your husband, your neighbors.&nbsp; Think of someone that you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">have a hard time with and see if you can see them in their soul</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">and see if you can feel them beyond their meanness if they’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">mean, beyond whatever they do that pushes your buttons.&nbsp; See if</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">you can see them from the top down.&nbsp; See if you can see and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">understand the way they got distorted the way they became</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">uncomfortable and send them love light from that space without</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">responding to the negative space that pushes your buttons.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">I’m going to turn it over to Gijs who is going to call in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">light.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>Gijs</strong>:&nbsp; Calls in the light.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">Dear God/Goddess, source energies, we ask for the presence of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">love light.&nbsp; We ask the love light to surround and protect and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">connect with each person who is here with us.&nbsp; We ask for any</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">negativity to be taken to the highest realms of light to be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">transmuted for the highest good of all concerned.&nbsp; We envision</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">ourselves in the flow of this energy which radiates from the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">center of the universe, through all the galaxies, through our</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">galaxy, through the solar system, through all the planets and is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: times new roman,times;">coming into the outer energy fields of mother earth.&nbsp;
