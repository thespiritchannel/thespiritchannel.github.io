font-size: large;">Channeled and Edited by Terry Brown</span><br /><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Transcribed by Connie O'Brien</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Welcome everybody; this is Monday May 2nd, 2011.&nbsp; I was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">just giving a little introduction to say that the basic</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">foundation idea of all the work we’re doing connects to what</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">our source, two group souls that identify themselves as group</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">souls, and I think they are.&nbsp; But, I tell everyone you can hear</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">our stories and make up your own mind.&nbsp; Their operating principle</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is what they call the ‘Law of One’ which has to do with ideas</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that you’ve probably already been exposed to:&nbsp; i.e., “We’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">all one”, “when two or more are gathered”, “as you do it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to the smallest of these”.&nbsp; We have been learning as a group</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and I’ve been learning just along with everyone else, is,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“How do you make that real?”&nbsp; “How do you experience</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">oneness?”&nbsp; Not just have it as an idea but as an experience. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">All of us have experienced oneness, perhaps not with the entire</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">universe, but if we’re lucky we may have experienced it with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">our spouse, our children, our cats, our relatives.&nbsp; Even a famous</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">entertainer that you identify with and you just feel connected</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with them and you say “I understand them.”&nbsp; So, we all have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">experienced oneness, but when you start moving into the Law of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">One, you up the ante because now the oneness goes into the realm</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of unconditional love.&nbsp; Because, once you get into a larger</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">experience of oneness – now, what would be a larger experience?</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;Maybe, if you go to church, you feel one, have a sense of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">oneness and belonging with all the members of your church;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that’s larger.&nbsp; Maybe you have a pride for your city.&nbsp; Your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">city has a community; that’s moving into a kind of oneness. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Maybe you have a pride for your country – nationalism –</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that’s oneness, but that’s smaller levels of oneness.&nbsp; When</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you get into the Law of One, it means that you are one with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">everything, everyone - even things that are negative.&nbsp; You start</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to look at it all and you start to comprehend how it all works,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">how to be compassionate, how to let go of little grievances</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">towards people, how to forgive yourself. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Let’s say at the very highest level of oneness there are beings</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that are very large – energies, they’re energy beings, and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sometimes they take the role of God in this realm.&nbsp; And, we are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">all part of them but we usually don’t feel that.&nbsp; We’re lucky</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">enough, most of us, if we can love our husband and our children. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">We are going to call on everyone to make at least the image and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">vision, because things start with visualization, that you have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">greater degree of oneness possible than you’ve experienced. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Our topic tonight is “How to make things happen faster”, how</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to increase the speed of things.&nbsp; On an individual level, it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">how do you expand into a greater awareness of this concept called</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“oneness”; how do you do that?&nbsp; On a bigger level, how do we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">change the world?&nbsp; How do we, as individuals, change the planet? </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Because we need to do that right now – the planet’s really</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">screwing up, and it’s screwing up probably because of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">factions of people on the planet that do not experience what</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we’re talking about, don’t even experience that’s possible</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and they have individual agendas for smaller groups that somehow</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">come out to: “I win and you lose.”&nbsp; And, “I win, you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">lose” is not the Law of One.&nbsp; I win and you win, and of course,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">my name is Wynn – so now we have a “win, win, Wynn”</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">situation – how do we expand into that? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Of course, this is free will so you don’t have to do it, but</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that is going to be the point of our talk tonight.&nbsp; We are going</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to have the chance to communicate with these sources.&nbsp; Of course,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">if you haven’t read my story please do; (because) I’m not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">doing this because I woke up one day and said “Hmm, I want to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">tell everybody about oneness.”&nbsp; This all happened to me because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">- many of the people on the line know the story in and out so</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’m not going to tell it, but my personal experience – I had</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this unusual situation where people around me, two people,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">started to communicate with a voice, an intelligence, that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">identified itself as coming from this higher place.&nbsp; I’m very</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">skeptical; I always tell people “You should be skeptical too. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">You shouldn’t believe anything until you integrate it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">experientially.”&nbsp; When these voices started talking to me and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they identified themselves, I didn’t believe they were who they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">said they were.&nbsp; I couldn’t believe it, it was too casual.&nbsp; One</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of the voices said it was the Council of Elohim, and when I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">looked up the word ‘Elohim’ it said the Elohim were the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Creator Gods of the physical universe.&nbsp; I couldn’t believe they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were talking to me.&nbsp; I said, “Maybe (it’s) somebody is making</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it up, or maybe my girlfriend is crazy”, but all these</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">phenomena would happen, like people started getting healed.&nbsp; They</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">started to make very accurate future predictions, and I suppose</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">after about a year I started to think, “Maybe they are who they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">say they are” and after two or three years, I became certain of it. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Then, I have this idea like, “How do I do this?&nbsp; I think a lot</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of people are going to find this valuable.”&nbsp; I mean, if</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’re talking to a consciousness that created the universe and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’re given an open door to ask questions about anything you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">want, then I said to myself, “Well, I’m going to ask</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">questions; not only things I want to know, but what does everyone</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">want to know?”&nbsp; And, we have hundreds of question and answer</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sessions with them where they have explained things that I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">don’t believe have ever been explained before.&nbsp; One of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">interesting things is, I asked them “Do you guys really like to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">be worshiped?”&nbsp; Historically, the name ‘Elohim’ is the name</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">for God in the Old Testament, and of course both the Jewish</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people and the Mormons use that name for God.&nbsp; I said, ego“Are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you the same Elohim?”&nbsp; And they said they were.&nbsp; And I said</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“Why are you talking to me?”&nbsp; At the time my life was a total</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">mess, I figured they should talk to somebody that had it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">together.&nbsp; They said I was like a cosmic midwife and I didn’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have ego about it and that it was a really important connection. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Over time, I started to see my own value in this and my own</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">talents and my own abilities, and that I really don’t have ego</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">about it; I don’t actually want to be celebrated, I don’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">want to be a big deal.&nbsp; But, I do want to be of service because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it’s very rare to be having these kinds of communications and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this access - if they are who they say they are.&nbsp; It’s even</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">rarer to do it publicly like this, where anyone can listen in. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The way that I have found is to tell you not to believe me; to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">tell you kick my tires, read my story and if it resonates, come</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">back.&nbsp; If you think it might be true, come back and keep</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">listening and if it doesn’t, it’s fine.&nbsp; Go find something</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">else that works for you. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It is important right now to find something bigger than yourself;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to find something that helps you learn how to live in this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">oneness - not to believe it, but how to live it in a reality; how</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to have compassion.&nbsp; It’s important – again, because this is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what my sources are saying, this is what these guys are saying</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">– explaining there’s going to be a division of souls and some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">souls are going to graduate this realm, and some are going to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">repeat.&nbsp; How do you – if that’s true, then there is kind of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">an urgency to make sure you know the criteria to graduate if you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">like that idea.&nbsp; Or, if their explanation is correct, you’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going to end up having thousands of lifetimes in a very difficult</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">world like this one, or perhaps even worse.&nbsp; This is an important</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">thing to explore and see how it resonates. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">For those of you who have been followers of Jesus, it’s not so</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">different from what Jesus says – “one will be taken and one</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">will be left behind”, “the meek shall inherit the earth”</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">– it’s not different it’s just more detailed, it’s more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">esoteric.&nbsp; It’s not as simple as saying – at the time Jesus</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was here, the kinds of explanations we’re talking about –</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were way too sophisticated for the people.&nbsp; But now people are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sophisticated; they want to know why they should believe</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">something.&nbsp; They want to know, “How do I know this is real?” </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Otherwise, they’re not going to go for it.&nbsp; So, they put me in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the situation here, having a background as being a physics major,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">having a background being scientific – they put me in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">position of explaining this to people, going by my experience so</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you can decide if it’s real or not. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I will tell you, we’ve been doing these calls for a few years</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">now, and they’re getting better and better; I’m getting</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">better, I mean I’m getting more confident, I’m seeing how</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it’s impacting people.&nbsp; I get emails from people that tell me</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they came on the calls and they got a job, or their life changed,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">or they reconciled with their wife, or their children who they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">haven’t heard from suddenly called them, or their breast cancer</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">went away.&nbsp; There’s an energy on these calls, and if you can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">tap into that energy...&nbsp; Energy is energy we could say it’s the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy of oneness, we could say it’s the energy of the quantum</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">field; we could say it’s the energy of these group souls coming</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">into this realm – we could say all of those ways are ways of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">describing it.&nbsp; The bottom line is, there’s something on these</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">calls to be experienced and if you keep coming back to them, I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">would suggest at least come back for a couple of months and if</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">its dead energy at that point, then it’s not for you.&nbsp; Some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people get it the first time, some people get it the second time.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;I mean, there are people who come into the calls for six months</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and suddenly “wham” they email me and said “I got it!&nbsp; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">felt it!&nbsp; I know what you’re talking about.”&nbsp; Because it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">subtle; because it’s oneness it’s part of you.&nbsp; It’s not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">like something sits down next to you and says boom, “We’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">here.&nbsp; This is the Elohim.”&nbsp; You feel it; it’s part of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">yourself.&nbsp; It’s an extension of you.&nbsp; It’s hard to put into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">words until you have the experience.&nbsp; It would be like telling a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">guy who is color blind what colors are.&nbsp; Where do you start?&nbsp; All</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I can say is, in the time we’ve been doing this many people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have had the experience.&nbsp; And, once you have it you can’t take</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it away.&nbsp; It’s yours.&nbsp; You own it; it doesn’t have to do with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">me, it’s an extension that you can hold for the rest of your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">life. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The question is, “How do we do it faster?”&nbsp; I know that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people who want the experience want it faster.&nbsp; I know I want our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">group to get bigger faster.&nbsp; I know there are millions of people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">out there that wish they knew this existed, but they don’t. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The challenge is, there is quote I sent out today from Margaret</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Mead:&nbsp; it’s always been a small group of people – I’m not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reading it directly – “a small group of people with a high</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">intention that cause great changes on the planet.”&nbsp; I believe</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that’s true, and we’re a small group of people.&nbsp; Many of us</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">on this line have high intentions.&nbsp; We’re going to have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">conversations about how we do that. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">One little thing that I’ve learned, and this is something that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I learned a little bit from Daphne, I learned it a little bit</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">from all my conversations and I learned it from just doing this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and watching how it works.&nbsp; When you want to create something</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that doesn’t exist already on the planet…&nbsp; Of course, there</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are many ways to do that:&nbsp; You can build a house on a vacant lot</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">– it didn’t exist, and now it exists.&nbsp; You called the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">contractors.&nbsp; When you want to do something big, something that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">involves a change of consciousness, there’s something different</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">at work there.&nbsp; It goes back to what Jesus said “when two or</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">more are gathered I am also present.”&nbsp; Or: a small group of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people can change the world.&nbsp; What happens is, if one person has</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a vision, the vision is only with that person.&nbsp; One person can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not create a change on the planet with their vision.&nbsp; Two people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">holding the same vision become astronomically more powerful.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reason for that is: the way things work is they have to get</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">established in other dimensions, and then download back into this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">dimension.&nbsp; There’s probably a new concept for some of you, but</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">think about it, it has to get established.&nbsp; Everything in this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reality starts from outside this reality, particularly all of us.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;We all came in from other dimensions and took bodies.&nbsp; The other</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">dimensions are real; every time we have a thought, every time we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">do anything, we are changing vibrations.&nbsp; Most people don’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">make permanent impact because they’re changing vibrations and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">then they change right back again.&nbsp; In order to change something</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">so that it sticks, it sticks to the other dimensions and some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people call that the grids, there has to be enough people holding</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the energy all the time, or at least a percentage of the time, so</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the idea is always being held in the other dimensions.&nbsp; In which</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">case, at a certain point, it gets picked up and spreads like</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">wildfire. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I sometimes say “When everybody thought the world was flat, the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">first guy that said it was round got in big trouble.”&nbsp; Socrates</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">got in big trouble.&nbsp; But then, Plato wrote books and every one</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">read the books and as people starting reading the books, it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">started to spread.&nbsp; Jesus got in big trouble; but then, he had</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">these disciples that were so impassioned that they kept holding</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the vision, and before you know it, we have billions of people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">aware of this one individual who made a huge impact on our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">planet.&nbsp; That doesn’t mean that impact now is all perfectly</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">positive; it doesn’t mean it hasn’t gotten distorted and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">screwed up, because it has.&nbsp; But, the original teachings are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">still there; I’m quoting them:&nbsp; “When two or more are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">gathered” – that’s as true now as it was then – and many</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">other things that Jesus said.&nbsp; I’m not a Bible person and I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">don’t believe everything the Bible says, but I do believe the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">things that I say, “That makes sense” and that I resonate</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">We are a group of people here, and those of you who keep</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">listening to these calls are helping to hold a vision.&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going to stop talking; I’m going to call in the Light… </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Alright.&nbsp; Father Mother God we ask for the presence of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">light to surround and protect Terry, myself, everyone on this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">call and everyone who listens to this call.&nbsp; Right now, we see</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the energy starting from the center of the universe, through the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">galaxies, through the planets, through the outer energy fields of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">We invoke, for those that would free-willingly choose to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">participate, a group energy amongst all of us present going back</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to the oneness that we exist in at the same time that we exist as</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">separate, individuated bodies on planet earth.&nbsp; We invite those</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sources to join with us and we create a huge group energy of all</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of us and all of them.&nbsp; We create a protected space that only the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">positive has access to, and anything not of that nature must</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">leave now. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">You can take a moment, shut your eyes, and you may feel an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy, you may feel a sense of peacefulness, you may feel a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">connection.&nbsp; Those are all indications that you are tapping into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the oneness.&nbsp; So, we invite our sources to greet us through Terry</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and we’ll ask some questions.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Creator.&nbsp; This is May 2nd, 2011 and we are delighted to be with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">each and every one of you.&nbsp; We are not only on the BBS Radio or</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">on the conference line.&nbsp; We are through the ethers and we are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">non-linear and we are connected with each and everyone to the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">degree that the individual wishes to become connected.&nbsp; We can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">hear your questions; we can hear what you request of us.&nbsp; We are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">here to give assistance and to bring love light into your realm</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">so that you have a connection with home.&nbsp; Do you have questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; I would say everyone that’s listening to this call</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">has something that they would like to transform, both personally</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and planetarially, something that they wish would change.&nbsp; And,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we want to discuss the operatives of how change occurs.&nbsp; I have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this idea that it starts out with a group of people, maybe one</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">person, but it turns into a group who share a common vision that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">penetrates into other dimensions, and then it starts working on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the collective.&nbsp; And, before you know it - it maybe hundreds of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">years - but over a certain period of time (there’s not that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">much time now), we want to understand how this process works</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">better so that we can all participate in creating the changes</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that we would like to see.&nbsp; Could you share anything about this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">process?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; You had mentioned earlier on the call that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">getting something started is harder than to take something that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">already has momentum and doing something with it, as something</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that is not in the realm is created by individuals.&nbsp; Oftentimes</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it is not in the consensus reality; it is not in the computer</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">program so to speak.&nbsp; To get it into the programming of the cells</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of the people, of the consciousness of the surroundings can be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">incredibly hard, as individuals are in a so-called ‘program’</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">already.&nbsp; For them to move into a new program can come up against</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the old program and create much resistance.&nbsp; So, the hardest part</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of getting a change to happen is at the beginning of the change. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There is a thing that one can do, and we send it out to you as a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">framework to help change occur faster.&nbsp; That is: time can go at</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">different speeds depending upon your frequency.&nbsp; If you can raise</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">your frequency then time can appear to speed by; but in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">actual realm, the third dimension, time is slower. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">So, if you take an hour within your realm and you operate at the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">speed and frequency of your realm, it is one hour.&nbsp; But if you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">move your frequency higher, you can set us as an example of a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">higher frequency, you can increase the amount of time within that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">hour.&nbsp; So, although your clock will go around one hour, you will</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">be able to get much more done.&nbsp; Things move faster at the higher</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">frequency, and therefore you can accomplish more in a shorter</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">amount of time.&nbsp; Also, in the higher frequency, you have momentum</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going; it’s easier to get momentum going because things are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">moving faster and so when you bring that package into your realm,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the sphere around you that you mold with your creative mind, you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can make it into a time where you can get more done and you can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">be more creative.&nbsp; That is one way to increase what you can get</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">done.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">When you bring that increased rate of time into your sphere, you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can not only do it for yourself but you can do it for your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">activity, for your surroundings; and therefore you can accomplish</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a great deal in a shorter amount of time.&nbsp; Go ahead and ask your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">question.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> First question is:&nbsp; because we have this shift that’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">happening and this cycle-end, to my understanding, there is more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy flooding the planet.&nbsp; Does that mean it would be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">theoretically easier to do it now than it would have been a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">hundred years ago or five hundred years ago?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; That is correct; it is easier to do it now as there is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">more energy, more momentum of particles - and therefore easier to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">get momentum changed and to get momentum and change going in a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">different direction.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Let me ask some ways that I’ve heard that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people can change their frequency.&nbsp; Because, probably, when we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">talk about changing our frequency, we also have to go above our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">own patterns.&nbsp; In other words, if we’re going to like move to a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">higher frequency, we all have our own patterns that keep us in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the lower frequency and so the questions are:&nbsp; how do we raise</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">our frequency?&nbsp; I could ask this as an open-ended question first,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and then I’ll bring up some ways that I have read, heard or</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">even applied to myself that I’ve seen work and get your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">viewpoints on those ways.&nbsp; So, how do we raise our frequency as</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">an open-ended question?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> You can raise your frequency – it is a feeling you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can get if you read the book Questions and Answers with the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Elohim you can get a sense of the higher frequency.&nbsp; If you come</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">into the calls you can get a sense of the higher frequency.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is like being a radio dial and a radio moving with a different</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">frequency as you change the dial; the whole matrix of the soul</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can move, and that is one thing that the tunnel of light that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people can choose to go through after they die – does.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">changes the frequency of the individual to the higher frequency</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of heaven so they can actually experience and manifest a change,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in frequency in the tunnel of light to bring them in a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">harmonizing frequency with heaven and even higher realms.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I know on our Sunday grid healing, that’s probably our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">longest call, and yet I’ve noticed how the time seems to go</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">faster and faster; I would say it seems to me that more and more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people on the call are holding a higher frequency, which then</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">tends to pull someone that’s new into that higher frequency. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Whereas, if you only have new people, everyone is sluggish and it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can take a long time, if at all, to get the energies moving.&nbsp; Is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that an accurate way of looking at that?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes – this is our experience also.&nbsp; When we first</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">started doing the calling, we would come in we would notice this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">huge discrepancy between our speed and the speed of the realm,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the individuals in the realm, and Terry’s speed.&nbsp; When we have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">been on the call now for a while, there has become an ability</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">within Terry, and also many of the people on the line, to move</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with the frequencies and also with your preamble to bring people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to the higher frequencies, and so we do not experience such a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">discrepancy now between yourselves and Terry and our group.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; I think everyone has noticed, everyone on the planet</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">notices, there are certain events they participate in where time</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">moves fast and other events where time moves slow.&nbsp; For example,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">if you go to a wonderful music concert and it has the right</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">uplifted energy, you could spend two or three hours and it seems</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“Where did that go?”&nbsp; whereas, if you’re sick or arguing,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">or extremely unhappy, or lonely, time moves much more slowly.&nbsp; In</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">those circumstances, are people actually moving into other</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">dimensions and other timelines?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes they are.&nbsp; Whereas the music, the music strums the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">vibrations of the body and brings them to the frequencies, a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">different frequency, than they have been at.&nbsp; It gets the DNA</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">moving, and the DNA can then connect more easily with the higher</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">realms and take someone into a faster experience of time.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> So let me ask some specific questions about raising</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">frequency.&nbsp; Some people would say changing your diet can help</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">raise your frequency.&nbsp; Can you comment on this?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; That is very true, because matter can lodge in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the body, and this matter then has a certain immobility and a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">lack of clarity wherein resonances within the body cannot be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">carried out easily and it weigh(t)s the body down; which then the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">soul, the matrix experience, has a slowing down and a weighting</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">down. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">A person who has not chosen a good diet may be tired and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sluggish.&nbsp; A person who has chosen a good diet may have lots of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy and radiate out that other people can see and resonate</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I would say if you were going to say “What’s a good</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">diet?”&nbsp; I don’t think you could say “One diet fits all.” </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">You could say some people are vegetarians, some people seem to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">think they need to eat meat to ground them – are there some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">general guidelines for diet, across the board, that everyone</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">could benefit from?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Vegetables are very good that individuals, were they to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have a lot of vegetables in their diet, would then have a cleaner</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">burning system, and they’d have the ability to build cells that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">were more viable than say a more impure diet, wherein one may be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">eating tainted food or meat that was not properly grown; soda pop</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that then was laced with fake sugars that were poisonous in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reality; vitamins made from petroleum products, they do not make</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the cell resonance that live vitamins have.&nbsp; There are many good</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">books on diet and the use of vegetables in diet.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I notice when I eat a lot of vegetables that I’m less</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">constipated, things move through my system better.&nbsp; It seems to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">me that being constipated really makes one sluggish and slows</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">your frequency down.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes, it makes one groggy and tired and not as connected</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with their surroundings.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Am I correct in saying you can’t give people ‘one size</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">fits all’ on diet?&nbsp; Like in terms of saying “be a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">vegetarian” or “eat meat” or “eat fish” or “eat</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">chicken.”&nbsp; I mean, in general is that something people have to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">come to terms with in their own chemistry, body chemistry?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; Yes, they do.&nbsp; There are some general guidelines,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">like soda pop is not a good thing to drink in general.&nbsp; These</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">fake sugars are not a good thing that can gradually act like a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">toxic substance to the body.&nbsp; To keep a clean body, to perhaps</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">even stand one day of every so often drinking water or having</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">vegetable juice, fresh vegetable juice, is very good to help the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">body stay clean.&nbsp; To keep good hygiene, to take very good care of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the teeth so that the teeth do not collect plaque and many</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">diseases come about when the teeth are not taken care of, or</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">toxic materials are used to fill cavities in the teeth.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; So moving on from diet, let’s look at the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">idea:</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Jesus said “when two or more are gathered, I am also</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">present”.&nbsp; Now obviously, he didn’t mean him/his body; his</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">body doesn’t become present, his physical body, when two or</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">more are gathered.&nbsp; I have a feeling that when two or more are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">gathered for a higher purpose, a spiritual purpose, there’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">automatically an increase in frequency.&nbsp; Could you explain a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">little how that works?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> When two or more are together and are radiating to each</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">other, it makes a bigger resonance between the two that can then</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">intake higher frequencies more easily, as one radiates energy to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the other, then it vibrates the cells of the other’s body and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">matrix, and like strumming of an instrument then it raises the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">whole energy to a higher frequency, assuming that the people are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not in a big argument, which you could then say they really are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not gathered together, they’re in opposition and defiance and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there is a disconnection really, between them.&nbsp; But, when people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are connected and in harmony, it creates a radiance, and, every</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">soul needs this connection, and they can only get it from</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">another.&nbsp; When they are in greater harmony, the greater harmony</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that they are in, the more they can bring in the higher</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">frequencies and the higher beings.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Now how about personal intimacy, how does that connect</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with “when two or more are gathered”?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> The same principles apply – if one is intimate with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">another, when one is with another it depends upon their level of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">feeling connected.&nbsp; If they are together but are possessive; if</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they are together but are not honoring the relationship with the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">other and are merely owning it or taking advantage, then it will</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">be as a disconnection and the frequencies will not totally</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">resonate with each other.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; I think one of the biggest things that many</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people experience is loneliness, feeling kind of empty and every</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">day they get up and they go through their lives and they know</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there is something in them that can be fulfilled and it’s not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">being fulfilled.&nbsp; It seems like loneliness is one of those things</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that can keep a person from lifting into higher frequencies.&nbsp; How</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can a person deal with loneliness?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; When one is lonely then they have that program going</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">right then and so it propagates more loneliness.&nbsp; So, if they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">would raise their creative level and have them walk their body</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">out of the door, go to visit someone, go to an old folks home, go</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">talk to people, go to Starbucks, go and hang out where other</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people are, go to a dance.&nbsp; Even if they are in a city and they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">know no one, they can still go to a function and then they can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">begin to talk to others and start to create relationships.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I know that there’s this propensity, when you’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">feeling that way, that you think that no one is going to like you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and you’re going to be an imposition.&nbsp; When I’ve had those</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">experiences in my life I’ve always found that when I walked out</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the door and did something, the feeling would go away.&nbsp; But,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there was a lot of resistance to just walking out the door,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because now people might judge me, or see my loneliness and judge</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that.&nbsp; So I know the power of walking out the door.&nbsp; That gets</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the energies moving. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">What happens is, once you get the energy moving you go home and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you don’t feel so lonely; you feel connected, even though you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are still in the same alone circumstance.&nbsp; I also know for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">myself, as soon as I get involved with&nbsp;&nbsp; = technical difficulties</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">(51:26) =</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gijs:&nbsp;</strong> This has been an interesting call tonight, with raising</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the frequencies and it’s a very interesting call and getting</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">things done quicker, and time moving faster. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> That’s the thing, at the beginning of the calls the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Elohim felt like our realm was so slow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I feel like the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">calls are almost shorter; they’re faster and they’re shorter</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">(and the Elohim haven’t commented in a while about the calls</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">being slow.).</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gijs:&nbsp;</strong> Yes. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; So, why don’t we end the call for today? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gijs:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you Terry and everybody.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>All:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you very much!&nbsp; Thank you, Terry.&nbsp; Thanks, Gjis. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Good night.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Okay, thank you everybody.&nbsp; Love to everybody.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Bye (from all)</strong></span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gijs:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you Ra’An, thank you Wynn.</span><br /><br /></p>
