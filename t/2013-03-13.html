<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; This is March 13, 2013; Wynn Free in Sedona, Terry Brown in Sedona, and Daphne in Half Moon Bay, California. This is our call where we get questions from you and we submit them to our Sources.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We are really honored to have Daphne on the line tonight; she’s going to help us answer the questions. I’m sure most of you know who Daphne is, but if anyone is listening for the first time, Daphne is the inadvertent founder of our group. There was this question that I asked, “Does anybody want to talk to me?” and she answered. That’s what started everything on this fateful trip from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">One of the things that many of you are aware of in the history, if you’ve read our materials, is this idea of negative attacks. I didn’t understand negative attacks; I didn’t understand any of this. I had a chance to observe Daphne for quite a bit of time, trying to figure out why she was having this experience and how it worked and asking questions about it. It’s something, particularly when Daphne is on the line, that we have to be careful about.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I have absolute certainty there is such a thing as the negative in other dimensions. They have their agendas and this kind of work in particular that we’re doing is not in their plans; it’s disruptive. When we’re asking questions to our Sources and we ask about the negative, it has the potential—even by me talking about them right now; I’m just going to say this and then we’re going to clear the space—it has the potential to get their attention. They’re kind of psychic. It’s walking a fine line to ask about them especially in public on these calls. Some of you who have been a regular attendee and listening know, that there’s at least one time where we really put our foot in the mud. The energy of the call got really tacky and there was a whole explanation given by the Sources.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I know that there’s a lot of curiosity about that level. It’s understandable to have curiosity about it. I know a lot of the answers myself. Terry doesn’t seem to fall into quite the quagmire that Daphne has the potential to do. I’ve asked a question in a session with Terry, I don’t think it was a public session, about this particular topic. They said there was a certain amount that was important for people to understand so that they’d have more discernment.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The problem with what we’re calling the negative is that it’s tricky; it can misrepresent itself. It can tell you they’re Jesus; it can tell you they’re the Elohim; they can channel. When you’re trying to look for things doing Google searches, you very easily end up in a location that you may not want to end up in and you might have been tricked. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I certainly have been tricked in other lifetimes; I’m sure of it. I know particular instances where I thought something was Positive and it wasn’t and I became supportive of it. It goes with the territory. There is probably enough information in our archives. I know you’re reading them; you’ll find some of this out; there’s also information in the Ra Material about it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Of course you know when Carla Rueckert did the Ra Material, how much she was negatively attacked; almost died. She got to understand that it was that important to get this stuff out into the world that she was willing to risk that and go through a lot of suffering to do it. Of course, she and I are working together. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I think part of the reason that we have such good affinity is that we’ve both come to a place where we’ve had not the same experiences, but complementary experiences, in terms of what the negative is about and how they work and how they attempt to screw things up down here.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Being that I said all that, I’ll say a couple of things here, just as general overview comments:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The Positive does not create fear. So, for example, if you historically go into the Bible and there’s a God that’s the God of fear, the God that’s supposed to make you tremble, the God that tells you to sacrifice your children, then you can rest assured that it’s not a positive Source, even when everyone uses that name and thinks it’s God; it’s not the highest of highs.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The Positive does not take your decision-making power away; it supports it. It supports your discernment; it never encourages you to give up your power. It never tells you to follow it. It never says, “I am the only way”.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Another thing that I’ve observed: I’ve never asked this question, but I think this is a fairly good observation. Anything that tells you that deliverance is in the future has got something mixed in its polarity. For example, ‘things are screwed up now but when spaceships land things are going to be okay; they’re going to save us’, is very likely of the negative. If somebody says a certain person is going to return here and when he returns everything is going to be fine, chances are, that’s not positive or it’s mixed.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If you notice, on our calls, many of you notice this, there’s an energy present which is totally positive, totally uplifting and comes into your system. You can feel depressions leave, you can feel things change and it’s present, right now. You see, there is no future; there is only the now. In the now we carry our memories and our past life track. It’s all part of the giant illusion which we call life. We’re in the illusion. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The goal is: How do we raise our position in the illusion so we’re above things rather than buried by them? The Sources we’re dealing with have the ability to come down from way high in the illusion and connect with us so we feel it. From my experience and everything I’ve heard from people, the feeling is never taking you over; it’s never displacing you. It’s like part of you. In the Law of One there’s no separation; what’s above is part of what’s below.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It’s like in that song, “Look out for Mr. In-Between” because that’s where the negative exists. Do you know this song? “Look out for Mr. In-Between…” I always wondered why I liked that song; it was an old George Gershwin song. When you’re coming from a low place, which could be called a human place, then you’re accessing the energy of a high place, some of the intermediary places are kind of not energetically complete. There’s not a complete flow from the low to the high. If there was, there wouldn’t be a problem because there would be no negative getting through. It’s in the intermediary places that there are chinks in the armor where negative energies, negative entities in other dimensions, can have access. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">That’s why this kind of work is not to be messed with casually; because if you want to access the highest realms, you have to be prepared to clear or cope with the middle realms where negative attacks can occur.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Some people, some of you, even, get stuck in that area and it gets hard to get out of, because you’ve let something through. You have to be careful; see if you can understand why I am so cautious on these calls and why I say to be so careful about channeling. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Channeling is exactly the way the negative gains its influence in this realm. When a voice is talking to you through someone else, how do you know it’s not negative? How do you know you’re not being misled? How do you know they’re not trying to turn you into their patsy? That’s why you’ve got to be really careful; that’s why it’s really good not to start making a living doing this. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If you start making a living being a perpetrator of channeled information you now get very attached, you can’t help it. We’re all attached to making money and making a living. By making a living on channeled information, there’s a huge potential for the negative to come in and take it over, because now you’re dependent on your living. If you start being a voice for something negative, you can’t stop. You can’t stop because you won’t pay your rent.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It’s one reason that I can stop this at anytime. It’s one of the reasons our little pendant business helps to support this. It’s not depending on what we do as an output to make money. That means that I don’t have to worry about paying the bills and if a negative source comes through I better let them talk. That doesn’t mean a negative source won’t ever come through on these calls; it’s possible. One has to always keep your guard up, keep your discernment up; always learn to feel the energies of the positive. As you feel those energies, it’s kind of a second validation that you’ve got the right Sources.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Carla Rueckert or, it might have been Don Elkins, her channeling partner, made the comment when she started on the Ra Material, that the way to protect yourself from the negative is to never ask a question that’s not an eternal truth. In other words, the same answer would hold 10,000 years from now as now, which means it’s a truth of life. When you ask questions that are of the moment of time, you very much open yourself up to the possibility of a negative source.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Daphne and Terry are both in the middle of this; I’ll maybe let them make a comment on this; it’s an area that if I didn’t live through it I could never understand it. It’s not anything I could understand by reading about it or thinking about it. In other lifetimes, I know I was fooled and tricked. When you’re going around and looking on the Internet and doing searches: ‘2012’, ‘DNA evolution’, you will most definitely find, in my opinion, people putting out messages that are negative.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If a source says they’re Jesus, you’d better read it really carefully before you think it’s really Jesus. In many cases, using the name of somebody that’s famous and respected, like Jesus, is a temptation to ask people to give up their power and look for anything like that in terms of giving up your power. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If you happen to be a Christian, see if you feel the same resonance as a resonance to Jesus’ words in the New Testament; see if you feel a resonance with that or not, okay?; because it is tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky. If you’ve ever been duped by a good salesperson, you know how easy it is for someone to look good, get into your space and then lead you down the wrong direction.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">In fact, one of the problems I’ve had with Daphne is that I am a good salesperson and she kept worrying, “Is Wynn selling me something, or is this real?” Daphne, do you want to say anything about all this?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Am I putting you on the spot?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No, no; I think it’s actually kind of funny. Yes, you are a salesperson and you definitely are someone who can come off as, “What is this man selling?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What is he hawking? Do I dare trust him?” It took me a very long time to think, “What is this person’s angle?” You were so different than other individuals I had been accustomed to dealing with. You completely caught me off-guard; it’s been a very, very intensive education or re-education in assessing the value of lots of things.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It’s been very interesting.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Like Shakespeare said, “We’re all players on the stage, and we’ve all just donned these…” whatever in our life we’ve donned. We’ve had experiences and certain things that we think are us and certain things that we think aren’t us. But actually, it’s all us.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Even the negative is us; it’s interesting, this whole aspect of duality integration. Ultimately, it’s all one; light and dark ultimately are one, if that makes any sense. It doesn’t to this dualistic mind, but if you can get beyond duality, there’s just the beingness of All That Is; there’s creation. In the creation is the field of the Love Light; the consciousness field. Then, I guess you’d say the negative would be the lack of that.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It seems that it’s possible to create within the Love Light field and make creations wherein there are spaces or gaps, where there are holes; where there are holes in the hologram, where there are holes in the design. It’s those holes that can be corrupted. The holes form hooks; the holes form snags; the holes form snares; the holes form places that your frequency can be compromised.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">There are, actually, conceivably possible perfect creations where the Love Light field is contiguous, where there are no holes; where there is a completeness of the spectrum from the very lowest point to the very highest point. That’s not a value judgment; it’s just a frequency, a broadband frequency spectrum.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It’s interesting to think about it in terms of architecture. And then, of course, we’re all living it out. From what I understand, this is a grand experiment. No one quite knows how it’s going to turn out. People have their theories, but it’s really unknown to a huge swath of the population while in their physical, biological bodies, their sea-shells. I call them sea-shells; like a Hermit Crab has a sea-shell. He loses it; then it gets too big; then he takes his sea-shell off and goes and gets another sea-shell.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Anyway… </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Terry, do you have any comment on all this?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes; I think it’s all a matter of frequency. So, when you look into a negative thing, there are certain frequencies involved with it. When you move into that frequency you connect with everybody else that’s on that frequency. If it’s negative, then you’re connecting with a lot of negativity and that connection can draw negativity into you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Sometimes it can be sub-conscious; like, if someone has been negative in a past life and it’s kind of hanging there unresolved, but they don’t even remember it. Then it can attract frequencies that are the same frequency as that. If it’s negative, it can have negative consequences.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I think one of the things if somebody is into something negative, they can look at changing their frequency to take them out of the negative frequency. When they’re in the negative frequency, they can be impulsed by it and other influences in that frequency.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think that when a person first starts a spiritual path they decide, “Hey, there’s somewhere to go; I don’t want to be where I am.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They oftentimes have to go into seclusion or a monastery or a very intense discipline for quite a period of time, maybe even lifetimes, to insulate themselves completely from negative things. Otherwise, they have a harder time moving through it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Maybe once the person masters their discipline, they can now interface with the negative and not get pulled into it. I think that’s when a person becomes a better teacher or a better influencer in this realm.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

I think that’s why she can walk with equal ease in light and dark. I think that’s true.</span></p>

I can see it there and it’s just like a fact of life. But I don’t have to duplicate that frequency; I can see it; I can even experience it. But it doesn’t have anything in me to attract it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’d like to just make a little side-note here. Terry does not consider herself a saint. In fact, when I asked her a question about the life of Saint Catherine, she didn’t know she was going to become a saint. She was just showing up at the church and they were writing down what she said. If I can look at that and I know a few of Terry’s lifetimes, I can see that this quality of inter-dimensional connection is with her as an unexpressed talent. Until the exact right circumstance presents itself, that talent cannot express in the world.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If you look at the Elohim group and the Ra group, they’re not dummies. They don’t just need to talk through somebody; they need to talk in a situation where something can actually happen. They have to evaluate; is this a situation, if we communicate through this person, will it make an impact on the world? Or is it just going to be like a little curiosity factor? They’re not going to bother if it’s going to be a curiosity factor. They want to make an impact.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Even though I knew Terry for many years, I never knew she could do this. If I knew it, I wouldn’t have known what to do with it. It took me meeting Daphne. Then, suddenly that woke up Terry’s frequency of this connection and everything happened from there.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I would suspect that if we went back to the life of Saint Catherine, then Catherine would show up in that church and for some reason there was one person or more than one person in the church who could hold the grounding energy so that they could speak through her. What did they try to do through Saint Catherine? If you read it, a good portion of the dialogues with Saint Catherine were attempting to reform the Church. It sounds very much like the Ra group.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If you’re looking at our work, there’s a pretty good track; footprints through history that no one else has ever uncovered that I know of. I don’t think anyone has.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">First of all, there was this entrée of the Ra group in this early life of David Wilcock in Egypt in 10,000 B.C. Then there was the taking over of that work by the negative. Then there was this attempt to use Akhenaton to fix Egypt that didn’t succeed. But one of the things that did succeed was the creation of the Essenes, because, if I am putting the pieces together right, the Ra group was already, in 1300 B.C., preparing for Jesus. They needed Jesus to have a group to affiliate with, so he could figure out what he was supposed to do.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">That group was the Essenes, which was a group of Hebrews who lived in the caves and kept separate from other people. They were very advanced; there was a mystery historically, about where they came from. I found a number of references thinking that it was Akhenaton who sent people out to the desert to be the Essenes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Then you have Jesus coming in and the church later gets corrupt; people are not operating in the Christed frequency. It’s like 1400 A.D. now and Catherine, who happens to have this talent of bringing through messages from these high Sources, ends up walking into a local church. For some reason, the energy was correct to hold the space so she could bring through messages.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Somebody realized this was real; this was coming from somewhere. Then there was the trying to fix the church that started around Jesus; all this stuff about the corruption of the church, which became <i>Saint Catherine’s Dialogues with God</i>. You can see that even though somebody channels, they still have to kind of stumble into the right situation so that something can happen. Otherwise, it just never goes anywhere.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">This whole circumstance that we’re doing is just so unusual because we have two people who have such extraordinary abilities to bring messages in from other dimensions from what seems to be positive Sources and to cross-reference the information so that we can double-check. And we have Carla Rueckert working with us more closely; she’s going to be on our grid healing this Sunday.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We have you guys, who have been smart enough to keep coming back, to realize that this is a really epic thing that we’re doing. You are participating in it. The fact that you’re here is part of what’s making it work. It’s that thing if a tree falls in a forest and no one is there, is there really any sound? Not really; you guys are creating the sound, the grounding of this, so that it has the potential to move into the world.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Some of you actually understood all of what I just said and said, “Wow! I can see that!” So thank you for the group effort. You guys, by showing up, are holding the space so that it can manifest. And those people that are doing transcripts and volunteering; so many people that are making all this work.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Let’s go to the questions; I’m talking too long; it’s 6:42. We didn’t get a lot of questions tonight so it’s okay to talk about that. If I have some questions tonight that I think are kind of arbitrary, hanging between negative and positive, I may do a very quick answer to them. I’m not going to ask a channeling on them and I may not ask them at all; particularly because of Daphne and the protection of her space.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Father-Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light, to surround and protect everyone here and any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and be transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the Solar System, through the energy fields of Planet Earth, through our bodies and into the center of the Earth. Right now, we invoke a group energy connection of all of you present who would free-willingly choose to participate in that connection and we maintain the sovereign integrity of our souls. That means: we’re becoming a group energy and we’re also maintaining our individual energies. We invite those Sources that are Positive, service-to-others, honoring The Law of One, to join with us. We create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave <i>now</i>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We have some questions for this evening. For our first question we are going to ask this to our Sources through Daphne. This is from Gary in Redondo Beach:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">“If life is a series of successive moments of now, doesn’t that imply time? If there is no time, so that everything is happening at once, how does a free will choice ever have a chance of being made? I hope they’ll answer. Thanks, Gary”.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Gary, I’m not sure I understood that question completely.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">“If life is a series of successive moments of now, doesn’t that imply time?” Yes, well of course. Is there time? Yes. Is there time? No. This is the duality of everything. It depends where you position yourself on the matrix. If you’re up at the high level of the matrix, there’s no time. If you’re down here on Earth, there’s time; there is time as we experience time.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It’s like: even if the truth is that time is an illusion, when you’re in the experience of it, it doesn’t matter, because you’re in the illusion, so it’s real; within the framework of your experience it’s real. The challenge is: how do you move your own focus so that you can move above that place where you’re trapped in time? It’s like the Joni Mitchell song: <i>The Circles of Time</i>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If there is no time, so that everything is happening at once, everything is happening at once. That means at the higher levels, past lives-present lives are altogether. The future is not; the future is being created in the propulsion of the moment. It’s not fated; it’s changing, because the present moment is always changing. The fact that you came to this call, the fact that you are listening to me, changes something. What you do tomorrow is changing something. If enough people are holding a high enough space the entire Universe changes.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">If you’re making a free will choice, you have to operate within the place where you can do free will and not abridge someone else’s free will. If they were making a different choice and you’re making a choice, your choices collide and it may not be possible for both of them to exist.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">In any case, I don’t know if I clarified anything; let’s just give it to our Sources and see what they do with it. Thank you.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You are asking a question about positioning within the matrix; you are asking a question about the dimensional construct. You, from our vantage point above duality, you see time as a construct of the fourth dimension.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Think: in the third dimension, the third dimensionality has the construct, from our perspective, of choice. The fourth dimensional aspect is the dimensional aspect which you would term the astral aspect or the emotional aspect. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The emotional aspect, when brought into a confluence, when brought in to the now moment of non-judgment, when brought into the now moment of the compassion of the heart, ceases to have cause-and-effect. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">When cause-and-effect cease operating, the propulsion of time in the old-style of the architected time-space causality function, this ceases to exist; this ceases to become a construct of your reality system.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">You are then creating from the eternal now, from a grace-infused moment. When one can stop the judgment, one stops cause-and-effect. One no longer binds oneself to karma. Karma is a causation; karma is cause and effect, action and reaction, push and pull, Yin and Yang, male and female.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We would even say that once you move beyond duality, the mating-dance, the relationship architectures, marriage, all of this ceases to exist in the way you have experienced it in 3D. The completion of self is no longer required outside of self or self finds completion within the octave of self. Each is male, each is female, each has the abilities and capabilities of the Divine infused within the Divine matrix.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">This is not say that there will not be loving relationships, that there will not be marriages. It is to say that the need changes to fulfillment. This is to say that the karmic patterning of having to work things out is fulfilled; there is no more having to complete. There is no more having to bring it into balance; there is no more a vacuous feeling of a circuit not being run completely with energy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">When one reaches the still center point of integration, the karmic consequences come to a balance-point; time ceases to flow and the function of self becomes suffused with grace.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">We hope this has answered your question, Auuuuuuuuuum.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m going to answer this question quickly and then I’m going to do a question for Terry. Thanks for letting us talk so much earlier; it helps to balance the energy, particularly Daphne, who as you know, sometimes comes on and then she’s not here and she can’t handle it. So we’ll try to create an integrative energy, so she wants to show up more often. The question here is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">“What can you tell me about alien ships that are outside of our atmosphere pressuring our government to tell the world population the truth?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">I’m going to answer that:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Those alien ships that are talking to the government are negative. All those people that are saying, “Aliens are coming to save us” are wrong. It’s misleading. If alien ships land, run the other direction. I don’t want to explain that in any more detail than that, but if you have respect for our work that is what we have come up with. All this stuff about the aliens landing and disclosure, I would be very wary about it. If you want to look on the Internet you’ll find that for a long time our government has been in collusion with negative aliens.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">And that’s it. Don’t ask more questions about that; just do Internet research. That was probably more than I should say.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Terry, are you there?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

I’m going to ask an easy question here, and the question is:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">“What is the inside, the center of the Earth, really like?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Let me just look at our time here; we have about two and a half minutes, so let’s see if we can get some answer in two and a half minutes and we’ll adjourn.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. We look at various portions of the inside of the Earth and we see that it is dissimilar place to place, particularly in the layers moving from the top of the Earth down. When you get to a certain level, you see oil as it is a lubrication. And, it is created from the various conditions that are available in the rocks. It is the lubrication for the Earth and helps the Earth in its movements.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">As we move further down into the center of the Earth, we see a constriction; and, we see an immense pressure as it is brought to bear upon the center by the various forces moving down upon that center. The very center is a dense matter, which it also has heat there based upon the action of the pressure upon the matter at the center.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">It is also a very thick viscous, we would not say liquid, but a viscous material. Terry does not understand the meaning of the word viscous. So it is a very thick material that is under pressure. It is not a thin liquid; it is a very thick matter that has some properties of, we don’t wish to say liquid, because it is not a liquid; we wish to say viscous.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Thank you.</span></p>

We have to get off.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">There’s one quick question I was going to ask about the crop circles; we do have a whole report on that. According to our work the Ra group has created the crop circles.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
