<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Wynn: This is Monday March 21st,(2011) Wynn Free, we are now recording. Hello to everybody who is listening to the recording, everyone that is listening to the replays. It’s our Monday night live broadcast on BBS Radio. Tonight we are having a conversation with Carla Rueckert - for those of you who don’t know who Carla is or what she’s done – she is - the word that describes her is a channel. She’s a human being; one of the things she does is channels, she brings through messages and voices from other dimensions. She is probably one of the most conscientious, highly intended, highly service oriented people that do that. Her work has influenced people around the planet; she’s brought through – one of her most famous, most well-known work is the four books of the Ra channelings. </span></span> </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Ra is a group soul comprised of graduates of this realm who act as a helper and guide for lower levels of evolution - like ours. They said in Carla’s channelings that there were two ways that they connected with our realm. One of the ways was through the verbal messages through people like Carla, or maybe just through Carla. At the time they said that was a very unique opportunity for their communication. The other way is through the beaming of love light energy – can’t remember if they called it love light – the beaming of energy (I’m not sure that’s the word they used) but the sending of energy from their dimension into this dimension for people who requested it. They said they worked with people who requested their assistance.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Of course, in order to request assistance you have to get the idea that there’s something to request to. I think one of the most valuable aspects of channeling is that it gives the idea that there’s something out there that you can make a request of. I want to be sure Carla concurs with our topic for tonight; I didn’t ask her and I just announced it – she probably will. Carla – the topic tonight is “Prayer and how that works”. </span></span> </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Wynn Okay good. As you see I’ve kind of set it up in that initial entry discussion because the Ra group answers prayers. That’s one of the groups that does that.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">I don’t usually call them prayers; I’m afraid to use the word prayer because – prayer automatically puts many people into the thought of religion and into the thought of church or places of worship I like to use the word ‘intention for the highest good of all concerned’, ‘intention honoring free will’. I think that’s very close to the idea of prayer. Carla is a very interesting person in this respect because she’s a member of her local church; she has used religion as a way of staying connected, and yet she also channels the Ra group. Now, she channels the Q’uo – I always call it the Kwo group.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">While we’re introducing people, we have Terry Brown on the line. Terry has been my close friend and associate and partner for a long time now. Terry also channels, and channels a group that identifies itself as the Elohim; and they say sometimes the Ra group is mixed in with their channelings and they made collaboration.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">When I hear voices I have no idea that anyone is who they say they are. I’m telling you what they say and I can tell you the results of the interaction with them. I remember the first time I had something extraordinary happen with the Elohim – most people have heard this story, but in case somebody is listening for the first time – the first time that happened was extraordinary. I got a notice that my sister was going to the hospital with a critical case of cancer and she wasn’t expected to survive this operation. I asked them “Can you help my sister?” and they said they could. The next thing that happened was my sister survived the operation. I was thinking of course it was coincidence; this was early on in this experience of talking to these guys. A few weeks later I got a call from my brother-in-law and he said something really weird happened because Joanne had to go in for tests to see if the cancer came back and the nurse said there was no cancer, but her lupus had disappeared and lupus never goes away. </span></span> </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">At this point I was convinced that I had some kind of intercession from this voice I was talking to. I asked them “How did you do that?” and they said it was like putting a filter in her blood and taking the lupus out. In subsequent conversations they said that in their realm they don’t ever call it miracles because things just readjust themselves according to intention all the time. In our realm things are very sluggish and slow, so when you make a connection between their realm and our realm some of that sluggish and slowness can shift. I would suppose when I was just having this channeling experience and I said, “Can you Help my sister?” That was like a prayer wasn’t it? Except, I was talking to them.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Terry and Carla who are both channeling these voices – and, in some ways, I think these are the sources that are able to re-adjust reality and that answer the call, and I believe that it’s the same sources that answer the call in the more traditional uses of the word ‘prayer’. We’re going to have a really interesting discussion and hopefully the outcome will be at the end of this show, that we will all know a little better how to ask for things we want to shift. And be sure – were going to make sure – that we all do a prayer at some point here for Carla’s impending operation which is coming up. When is it coming up Carla – is it scheduled yet? </span></span> </span></p>

I haven’t been able to do that lately because of difficulties, but I hope to get back to that after this procedure.

I have always lived my life really straight; I’ve lived as transparently as possible. It wasn’t that I proactively come out with it but those that were close to me of course, knew what I was doing besides singing in the choir at church. Fortunately, I never had any problems with people feeling that it was not something that I should be doing, to do the channeling. I would point out by the time that it doesn’t really matter what your service is as opposed to what your belief system is. Remember that Jesus was an Essene or a Jew depending upon with whom you speak and He began a whole new church. I’m not trying to begin a whole new church but the people that I care about are not the people that are in church. The people that are in church are set with lots of help. They have people to talk to in the clergy, in the laity; there are tremendous networks of help for those who are believing Christians. It’s the people can’t do Christianity, can’t do Judaism, cannot do Allah and Mohammed and Islam and cannot do Shindo, cannot do Hinduism that are pretty much twisting in the wind. Those are the people to whom my heart really goes out. Those are my people and if I can produce materials that are helpful to them that is totally of the blessing of my life. I really care about the people that are waking up and go, “What do I do next?” It doesn’t really matter what your belief system is but what the creator has for you to do may have nothing to do whatsoever except tangentially with your belief system. You kind have to go with it. </span></span> </span></p>

You know Terry sometimes blows me away because she’ll sometimes be listening to the radio and the news and I don’t usually listen to the news; I do when there is something really provocative. There’s one point of view that why listen to this stuff when you cannot impact it, it’s going to happen anyway. I used to get irritated with Terry for listening to the news and then we had a conversation about it and she said ,“Well this is how I find things that I should be praying for.” Why don’t you share a little bit about how prayer works for you, Terry. </span></span> </span></p>

They got one in Arizona one time near Show Low or the fires that were in San Diego. I would listen to the news and see where the hotspots were and then pray for them and one night, the fire was heading to Show Low and they announced in the evening that there was no chance at all that they could save Show Low but they were really trying. They had a whole crew of men out there trying to save Show Low and keep the fire line safe. </span></span> </span></p>

But, I was up most of the night praying for it. I get visio. I can see what’s going on sometimes just in my mind’s eye. I listened to the news and I get an idea of where things are needed and then I can pray. Sometimes it doesn’t change something because there’s something like for instance like with the Japanese nuclear situation, the news has been so widespread that’s there’s so many people holding the idea of what’s going on that its really harder to change. If something can be caught early it’s easier before everybody is thinking a certain way about it. So those are some of my ideas about prayer.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Wynn: Thank you. Maybe I’ll ask both of you the question and that is, since prayer is aimed towards something in your mind do you think of a group soul when you’re praying or do you think of the traditional idea of God. In a certain way I see that it’s all the same. Since everything is one, then when you think of a group soul it sounds like it’s a multiple, but it’s a multiple of one. Of course we’re one with one. I don’t think it makes any difference, as long as your intent is pure. Carla what do you think?</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: large;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Carla: When I’m praying I’m simply conversing but I’m conversing very intently. Sometimes I’m just praying, “Lord this is your day, and I give my will to you. What would you have me do?” Then there’s silence. I don’t get a direct answer. But, as the day unfolds, I discover what it is. If I’m interceding for someone else I say, “Lord, I’ve got this situation and I’m concerned about it and here is how it feels to me. I just ask for your light.” A lot of times if I’m praying – I’ve been singing in choir since I was four so I know the Episcopal hymnal really well – I will sing a hymn that is pointed towards that particular situation or problem. Basically I know when I’m praying I know what I’m doing is basically moving light – people say well send me some light. </span></span> </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 100%;"><br /><br /></p>

I think the angels are very much involved in the activity of prayer in this conversation. They are an agent of the creator directly, linked with the creator never having been incarnate and we are all guarded by angels. Not the archangels, not the ones that are at the top of the hierarchy, but there are lots and lots of people, there are lots and lots of angels. When you’re in prayerful or penitential or meditative situation the forces around you help you to grow brighter with the infinite, loving light of the creator. It’s always flowing through us, but we focus it when we pray, when we set an intention and when we have a concern. </span></span> </span></p>

I was in the midst of writing a blurb for his new book and I ran across this anecdote. He said that he had been working to get out of the body with the Monroe Institute and that he was practicing I guess you would say in a car and the car was going down the highway. He wasn’t driving, this is a good thing. He saw an accident across the divide on the other side of the interstate and it was a bad one. There were ambulances there and it was obvious that people were hurt. He saw light from the passing cars going to the wreck. After he woke up and he was thinking about it he realized that those were the prayers of the people that were passing and sent just a passing prayer to that stranger, and said, “Lord please help that person.” There is no prayer that is not answered.</span></span></span></p>

When we set our intentions and we focus our desires things happen. Sometimes the answer to a prayer is ‘no’, and so people will say, “Well my prayer wasn’t answered.” Well, it was answered, it’s that you didn’t like the answer, but it was answered.</span></span></span></p>

There are a lot of emotions and moods to prayer; the important thing about it is that we realize that in a large portion of the things that occur around us we have no control. That is not our area of control. What happens to us happens to us – it’s incoming and here it comes. Where our arena of control is in how we respond. Terry’s perfect example of this: listening to the news so that she can move right into the middle of the hotspots, not avoiding them, turning the station off; learning all she can about them so that she knows for whom to pray. That is a beautiful example of how you can set your intention and live your life according to principals that actually make it so that you live in a heaven on earth, so that you live in your own little universe, your own little creation that you’ve created; and, the way you live, the way you react to things, the way your respond – it makes your creation unique. It makes them a little bit different from everybody else’s because you have the choice over how you react.</span></span></span></p>

People are going, “Well this nuclear accident in Japan, this terrible tsunami that hit everybody and this awful earthquake – what can we do? How can we help? You can help. I think you can help in a couple of ways - I’m talking about prayer I’m not talking about obvious things like sending money to the Red Cross or whatever, or of course, the Bishop Sons for Episcopal Relief which is where we put the money because there are bishops on the ground there that know where the money should go. So Jim and I always donate through that.</span></span></span></p>

Second of all, in addition to praying if you set in your intention that you wish your prayers to join the prayers of all the people who are concerned for this matter you get a doubling effect. By leaning into to that doubling effect you can increase the light even more so that there's light just is pouring into the place that we’re concerned about right now which would be Japan. You can also do this for absolutely everybody that is suffering on planet earth. The great thing about prayer is you don’t have to say,“Okay I want you to send you send help to that knee, that tricky knee that is giving my poor friend such a horrible time. You just say, “Lord my friend needs help. Please send it.” The spirit knows where to go; you don’t have to direct prayer.</span></span></span></p>

I was praying and I got an impression of massive light. The next day my friend called me tears, the mom, and she said “There’s nothing wrong with my son.” She said, “First of all he was in the MRI taking one test, one last test, so the surgeons would know precisely where to cut to get these tumors out of the brain and she said the thing showed complete white light. There was nothing on the film but white light. So they took it again and there were no tumors. That’s how powerful the light of prayer is. </span></span> </span></p>

Of course they would not say they’re miracles at all, it’s just the way natural law works. So we just have to cooperate with that natural law. The natural law is that we are powerful beings and when we set our intention, it works. Energy is moved, and positive love is directed towards our concern. I think it may help for me to say a little about getting ready to pray, because you can’t always get ready to pray, sometimes you have to pray on the fly. Like, when you see an accident on the expressway, and I do – I always send energy to a wreck because I want them to be okay and I want everybody else on the road to be okay too. It’s very helpful to realize that you’re working with an energy body rather than a physical body when you are praying. You’re not simply praying from a physical mind to an unknown; you’re praying from an energy body whose mind is consciousness. The consciousness is one with all other consciousness, so you’re moving into a very united, connected stance and you’re asking some of the distortions of that stance to be altered for the better for that one person. What you need to do is work with your energy body to open it up, to relax it, clear the chakras up, clear up any concerns you may have over sexuality, survival, relationships, work, marriage, children, whatever – let it all fall away. Realize that you are an instrument and you are asking this instrument to vibrate with some love and connect. You’re basically moving your consciousness from the very beginnings of sexuality and survival up through the chakras, up through relationships, up through birth family, marriage family, work – all that stuff – moving up through communication right into the brow chakra. Once you get your heart open you can use these higher chakras, you see. If you have an open heart and an open energy body and then you reach up through the gateway to intelligent infinity and you say, “Help please, I need some help here!” You express your concern, then you let it go. What is going to pour through you is the response to that prayer. It’s going to pour through you, it’s going to pour through the person for whom you are praying. It’s not infringement on free will at all because the energy would never go where it is not asked for, it is not accepted. It only goes where it is needed. You don’t have to worry that you’re infringing on somebody’s free will; you don’t have to ask for permission to pray for somebody. You can just go ahead and pray. </span></span> </span></p>

There’s a big differential – like, in Libya. It’s hard to imagine them bombing and the problems going on there. There’s a huge differential between the intentions of the people over there. I can feel the prayers of different people which then can weigh the accumulative intention in a certain direction. When that direction is for the highest good, then the higher forces – the Elohim – can come in. It’s easier to make the connections between all the people’s intentions for peace and any other things going on that’s against peace.</span></span></span></p>

Then, their light can combine and can make a greater statement towards peace which can affect the situation.</span></span></span></p>

It’s a little bit of a more cosmic view, or looking that an individual might not see all of the other parties that are praying for peace, but they can just put forth their fervent hope, their fervent desire and it all counts together and it’s all heard. </span></span> </span></p>

They’re just holding the space of source down through the realms and their body is anchoring it and radiating it and other people feel it.” That’s my way of talking… of course, if you think something while you’re in that space, every thought you think is part of that flow and you’re helping to re-enforce that flow in it’s impact on everything around you.
