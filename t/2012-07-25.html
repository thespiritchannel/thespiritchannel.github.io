Thank you all who submitted questions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We start out with our little invocation to bring in protection. The reason this invocation works is not because the words are magic, but because they create intentions. The intentions—I say this quite often, but I’ll say it again—the intentions are the energies that a human has that allow a human to project through the veil. In other words, there is this veil that separates us from higher dimensions. An example would be: I’m sure you’ve all seen pictures of some lady whose son was caught under a car or something, and she walks up and she lifts the car up and pulls it off of her son. That’s the power of intention.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Each of us is learning how to have an intention. An intention is different than just asking; prayer could be considered another way of saying intention. An intention—the highest realms for the highest good of all concerned—might be what a prayer is.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">So we do our invocation to create an intention, to create a group energy, and to bring the energies in from other realms into our space, which some of you are learning to feel. Many of you will feel that if you stick with us after a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You’ll understand how that feels when the energies come in. I’d like to note that of course it’s different for everybody. And, for many people it can be subtle, even though it’s coming in from higher realms, it doesn’t mean it’s huge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is my experience—it’s almost like, since we’re dealing with an energy of oneness. We’re dealing with an energy of them and us being part of the same energy. There’s one energy in the universe. And so when we connect with these higher realms, the positive realms—it’s like connecting with a part of yourself that you’ve become disconnected with, and it’s like an enhancement; an expansion—a tingling. It may be akin to certain human experiences where you connect with an energy of another person except there’s no other person to connect with; it’s coming in from exterior.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I know many people who are on this call have told me, emailed me, how it feels to them, and it’s a little bit different for everybody. Some people, it hits them over the head and they’re on the ceiling. Other people feel it and they start to cry. They just suddenly know they’re not really alone, even though they thought they were. But it takes patience.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I sent that little extraordinary thing that I did with Daphne yesterday, which, I never know when something extraordinary is going to happen. Between Daphne and Terry, we do these calls and so many of them are really great. I listen to it and I say “Wow!” And, occasionally something goes through the roof, like “Wow Wow Wow!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Who are we talking to?” If you were on the workshop or listened to the replay, there was that time when I was having a conversation with Terry—with our sources through Terry—about how the universe was created.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And then they went into this awesome explanation; finally, they brought it home and there was all this loving energy. I can’t even put it into words, but when people listen to it, they get it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Yesterday was one of those times when Daphne just said “Hey, can we get them in; it would help me feel grounded” and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I turned the tape recorder on, and I just said “Let me see; I’m talking to them. Let me ask them questions on behalf of new people who are learning to pay attention to us.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">People are<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> </b>asking: “When do I feel the energies?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Terry said they’re here all the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m saying ‘Okay – I’m ready.’ And, I don’t feel anything.” They answered that really beautifully. That was on today’s email. If you haven’t gotten it, you can either spend $3, you can spend $100, you can spend $0 – its like you fill in your own amount. It doesn’t matter if you spend $0; we have to ask sometimes. So many of you are supportive, but no one is being denied that kind of stuff for money.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Even if you’re checking us out, and saying “Are these guys for real?” and you don’t feel inclined to spend any money, just get it for $0, keep checking this out. One day, when you get it, you’ll give something back. Why do you give something back? If you appreciate what we’re doing, giving back is a way of expressing gratitude, and gratitude is a way of bringing in higher energies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s a way of reciprocating, but not out of obligation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I don’t know if you guys can understand this, but in general, this world works on obligations. It’s one of the fundamental rules of the world. I do this for you, and now you do this for me and I do this for you; you owe me and I owe you and you owe me. Obligation isn’t bad; it’s like you rent a place and you pay so much per month and that’s obligation. You have a job, and your boss agrees to pay you so much per week, and you do this and he does that and that’s obligation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Where Grace comes in is where you do a little extra; something you didn’t get paid for. You don’t do it manipulatively, do it just to do it. It’s like that famous bumper sticker about “Random acts of Kindness.” It’s like, it’s the little extra things we do that we didn’t have to do that starts raising us above the law of obligation in this realm. Another way of saying obligation is the law of karma; or, “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then, everything is reciprocal. Everything is reciprocal and balanced in this realm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Only as you start to do things that you’re not obligated to do, but guess what—you open the door, and things come to you that you weren’t expecting, because the universe essentially responds. But, you can’t do it for the universe to respond; you can’t do that. You can’t sit and wait for it. You’ve got to do it out of the purity of your intention. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">That starts to invoke higher laws in the universe. Like there’s this law of grace. I don’t know if that’s a law, but the principle of Grace. The principle of grace—you notice grace and gratitude have the same root:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><i>gra: gra</i>titude, <i>gra</i>ce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As you create gratitude, as you do that, gratitude is another human quality that pushes your energy through the veil and starts to set up energy patterns for your own life, penetrate the veil and allow things to come in that wouldn’t have come in otherwise. It starts to attract synchronicities as you start to move into that, and many of you have sent me emails that they’ve watched synchronicities happen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Synchronicities are crazy; they don’t make sense, they’re non-linear. It means that you’re starting to create your own life energy patterns which are non-linear which means moving beyond the linear timeline we’re in, in this realm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some of you understand what I mean, and some of you will learn that. It doesn’t make sense; it’s not logical and you can’t control it. But gratitude is one of the things, intention is one of the things—there are all these things that you can do, that start to build the energy so that can happen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">On that note, I’ll call in the light.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I wasn’t going to give a lecture, and there I ended up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the light to surround and protect each person on this line, and any negativity be taken to the highest realms of light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth. Right now, we invoke; we intend, to create a group consciousness, a group energy field of all those present on this line who are free-willingly open to share that. We maintain the sovereign integrity of our souls while we do that. We invite those sources that are positive, service to others, honoring the Law of One to join with us and we create a protected space that only the positive has access to, and anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">And on that note, I have a question. Let me just make sure—Daphne, you’re online, yes?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I’ll remind you that who speaks to us explains themselves to be a conglomerate of group soul energies. They’re actually two group souls. Now, this is what they say, we can’t prove it, but they say one of the group souls is the energy that created the physical universe, and the other one is made up graduates of this realm. I’m sure it’s not the entire, whole group soul because there are billions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I guess there’s a certain—some day we’ll ask this question—there’s a certain amount that they place on to our call.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One of the reasons we feel them is because it’s group soul energy, not just one intelligence. So while we’re on these calls, there are two things happening. There is the answer to our question, which sounds like it’s one person but it’s not. And then, there is this energy that’s coming in that many of you can feel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No matter where you are on the planet, it comes in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">And so the question for them through Daphne is:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We welcome you this evening; we address you in this manner concerning the question you have asked. This is the Council of Ahn; it is our honor and privilege to share with you that information which we believe will help assist you in your evolving consciousness to move into those realms of self-awareness and self-assessment which enable you to make more clear, more growthful and more loving choices and decisions regarding life-circumstance and habituated patterns regarding your emotions, your preferences, your likes, your dislikes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We would address you thusly concerning what you perceive to be negativity emanating from another being.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">There are those in your field of experience who, for whatever reason, are working through patterns and reacting to situations from a place of fear. We say reacting, because they are not consciously responding with a loving or open heart; they are reactive from a place of primal, animalistic or reptilian complexes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Each human being has, at the base of their brain stem, something called the reptilian cortex. This reptilian cortex is that aspect of the lower nature of human self, traditionally in Christian teaching known as the fallen self, which has not moved in line with the Christ-consciousness. It is based on an exteriorization of survival, and survival of the fittest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Your job, so to speak, at this time of the ascension, is to fully recognize in every life situation the emanation point of those who respond to you, or those who react to you. The difference between response and reaction is the difference between light and dark. Response is a loving vibration; it is a vibration which invokes not only the heart and compassion, but also the other faculties. The intuition and the intellect can come into play. But, it is moved by love, and it is moved by a willingness to connect.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Reaction, on the other hand, is oftentimes divisive. It’s based on fear, it’s based on hierarchical patterns, and it’s based on old power structures:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>might is right, based on “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,” and old statutes of dominion over others, entitlement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We are moving into a time on your planet where it shall increasingly be essential that people recognize the Christed nature, the Christ-self, and apply a Law of One to each and every individual and interaction that comes their way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We would advise a person, when faced with a situation where someone is closed, reactive, shut down, that you, yourself, call interiorly for help from your angelic realms, from your guardian angels and learn through interior consistency of practice—and this is what is truly meant by spiritual discipline—it is a practicing and a learning to <i>keep your center balanced</i>; keep your center balance-point in whatever situation you may find yourself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It is easy to be centered around those who are loving, because they are re-affirming the Law of One, the Christed self; and they are flowing energy continuously towards you, and you towards them, thus creating an infinite light-loop. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>It is much more difficult to remain in a loving, centered, Christed space with one who is either antagonistic, or one who is shut down, because the physical effect, the physiological effect on your light-body, on your auric body is one of depletion. It is one of being drained. It is one of having your energies not received, not reciprocated, not acknowledged.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">This is a challenge for many, and until you master it completely, you will find yourself knocked off center and be triggered into an irritation, or an upset pattern yourself. This is a sign. This is a test, if you will, for you to practice loving kindness, both towards yourself and towards that one who can, for whatever reason, not accept love and not trust. Hold a state of intention interiorly for that person; surround that person with the love light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Traditionally, as Christ has said, turn the other cheek. Pray for your quote “enemies.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They are not your enemies; they are the unloved aspects of your own self.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">When you find the challenge of those in your matrix, those in your space, who are not perfectly reflecting the love-light consciousness back to you, it is simply an opportunity for you to become ever more perfect in your own walking, working light of bearing the Christed light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">The next question is from Jean. She didn’t say where she was, but it’s kind of a general question. I think I’m going to answer this one, because it’s a question that we’ve asked a couple of times and I think I can do a good job of answering it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">The question<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> </b>is:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I was wondering why it is so important to repeat the items that are put into the light every week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve learned that by repeating yourself, there’s a lack of confidence that your request will be answered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What do they think about that?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m going to answer the way this has been answered pre<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">v</b>iously:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">On this planet there is a multitude of beings with different intentions. There are many powerful beings working in organized groups, who are constantly using their intentions to re-orient the energy fields of our planet towards the negative. And they have free will to do that; essentially a tug-of-war going on between the beings who are orienting towards the positive and the beings who are oriented towards the negative.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">When you’re putting something in the light where you are asking for some kind of shift towards the positive and there are a number of beings who are putting something in the light towards the negative, then if you don’t keep re-iterating your request – and they keep re-iterating their request – they win.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So, when something is really important, then the re-iteration of the request is important.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Say for example, if someone is ill and you were praying for their healing, they perhaps have things inside them that are creating their disease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When you are praying, you are trying to help them to re-arrange that negative thing which could be a very old habit-pattern that keeps creating their disease. Do you pray one day and if they don’t get better, stop praying?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Probably not, because they will snap back and re-create the old pattern. It takes a lot of re-iteration, usually, to change that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It’s not a lack of confidence; it’s an understanding of the way energies work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s my answer to that question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Now, I want to ask another question.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m going to ask this to Terry. This is a good question from Joseph, Joseph Rodriguez. Thank you for your question.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Can a paralyzed person—Terry, you’re there, yes?—with a spinal cord injury elevate to a higher plane by energy flowing through the fourth chakra?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In other words, they’re concerned that because they have a spinal cord injury the energy can’t flow and they’re going to be blocked.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">There are other bodies within the individual than the material body and the physical body; there is the ethereal body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And, energy can flow through that body. The chakra systems can operate even though there is a spinal cord injury, there can be movement within the chakra system, as the chakra systems are a vortex of energy that is spinning normally in a clockwise direction in each of the chakras.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Once these are activated, then you can get the energy building. You can use breath to bring in prana from outside of the body also, to help energize and elevate the pranic energy which then helps you to connect to the higher realms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So, even though there is a spinal injury and a disconnect in the spinal area, you can still access the higher realms, and you can still get your etheric energy moving and your prana to a high level<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">.</b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I would ask another question on behalf of Claire who has asked the question previously, who has a very overwhelming, negative something lodged in her body that she’s having an extremely hard time with. It’s not just lodged in her body, it makes her see things in her eyes, and she’s semi-immobilized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Is there anything that you can share with Claire this evening that could help her?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

We also are working on the problem, and we have seen that there is a very high energy body that is accessing your body and taking off prana, taking off life-force, and we are working with that entity that it may stabilize and cease the need to connect to you in this negative manner.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We also see that there is a physical disconnect within the area from your power chakra up, and in through your digestive system; that there is a blockage and there are toxins running around in your body that are creating a dysfunction, and creating the, you might say, hallucinatory visions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">We see that working with your body, making sure you get adequate water, adequate nutrition, and when you get that nutrition, to put aside the negative during that period of time and sending the food and the water and the drink, sending it love-light so that it may have the best capability within your body for providing nourishment to your body. We see those main issues. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">And, to move to, for instance, drinks that you may drink that are very fresh and are partly fresh-squeezed juice, if you can get it, to increase the energy in your body to some degree in that manner, as your body is lacking in energy and electrical potential. Your bringing things to yourself that can increase electrical potential will help; making sure that your body has alkalinity can help increase the electrical potential.</span></p>

This is a question from George Houber. Now, if somebody sends a question of a very personal nature, I won’t use your last name if you ask me not to, but it is good to put your city in, because they do attempt to locate you. It’s good to be on the line so that they can feel your energy easier on the line. In fact, normally if I’m going to ask that if you ask that kind of question be sure to be on the line.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">What is the nature of orbs?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What is my relationship to them?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Obviously, George sees orbs or is sensitive to orbs. If you don’t know what an orb is, they are round, colored globes that most people don’t see but often turn up in photographs. Some of you may have seen that photograph of me giving a talk with the blue orb, a really bright blue orb, on my elbow. I did ask about that, I said “Could you explain that blue orb?” and they said “That was a member of the Ra group who was working with me while I was giving that talk.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">At another time when Terry and I were first at the beginning stages of communicating with the Elohim, I was there saying “Could you guys manifest an orb so that I can see it?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They said they already had an orb; that the orb was as high as the sky and it went into the earth, and that the Elohim orbs are so big—and that’s what they said—that it was beyond my ability to see them in a localized way. And so when I’ve asked questions about orbs in the past, they said that was a way that interdimensional beings interface with this realm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I would ask the following question, and that is “Could we expect that orbs are always service-to-others, or can service-to-self also project orbs into this realm?”</span></p>

We have heard the question. The entity known as George is experiencing light emanation patterns. Light emanation patterns can be projected through various densities, depending on the assimilation ability, the track record, the practice that that individual’s consciousness has had in moving between dimensions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It is relatively easy for positive, love-light vibrational energy to coalesce itself into a simple geometry and appear to your physical eyes as an orb of light.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When answering whether or not orbs are always service-to-others, in general the answer is yes. However, discernment must always be applied.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Orbs often appear in a similar kind of way, as in earlier times your angelics, your angels, would appear. They come to offer help, assistance, guidance and a reassurance that you are not alone in this realm; and that, indeed, your frequencies are making connections through the ethers, through the various vibrational tracks and connecting with the oversoul self. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">You are part of a larger group matrix; you are part and parcel of the Elohim and Ra star seed families.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As you develop your over soul consciousness, your love light vibration strengthens, and thus you begin to see emanations of yourself in the other realms, in the higher frequency realms, which are not physicalized as in a physical body, but in a sacred geometrical formation, usually of a circular nature. But, it can take other natures as well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Your crop circle formations are actually part and parcel of this same advancement of light through the various sectors of consciousness. Your crop circles, as they are appearing in your fields of grain in places such as the </span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;"> and </span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Australia</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">, are emanations of the love-light consciousness at a very high level of projected frequency vibration, and are indeed mathematical fractal patterns embedding through a multiplicity of dimensions to awaken those latent recognitive calibrations, within your own blood stream patterns.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">It is as if you have, within yourself, codes; codes, which when aligned properly, can allow the most beautiful harmonies, music, abundance, health, joy, resplendent love-light frequency, to flow. When the blocks are arranged in a disharmonious pattern, there is blockage in the life, and the health, the love light force, the flow of emotions, of intellect, of talent becomes with much more difficulty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We pray for his soul, but it feels that he is still earth-bound.”</span></p>

He is with you, and we see another part to your person. He is with his children and wife; he is confused, and he has not totally adjusted to his new circumstance. He has not fully realized where he is, and the change that has come to him, and he is trying to straddle the world that he left behind, and to still operate, to a certain degree, within that world. </span></p>

This leaves him with incompletions, that he needs time to be able to fully realize what his options are at this time.</span></p>

We send him love-light and caring, and we have placed information, both for you and him, about his circumstance. It is very hard for him right now. He is sorry for what he did, and he wishes to come back and to pursue the raising of his children and the completion of the things that he so loved and his wife, and the relationship, and his family, his outer family.</span></p>

He asks a very good question that probably many of you might have asked in yourself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">“The Elohim seem to treat agency, or free will choice, as hallowed territory not to be tampered with by them. Yet, my third density thinking has a problem with their position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Our world is controlled by 2% negative elitists who seem to take great satisfaction in denying the rest of the 98% of us our free will choices, e.g. the right to own firearms, the free will to travel unencumbered by any government authority, the right to drink whole milk, the right to eat non-GMO foods, etc. etc.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">In other words, it seems that the rich are the only ones with true free will, and the peons get the dregs of free will, as the elite may feel disposed to dispense to us. Why would the Elohim stand by and allow these elitists to steal our free will, with no apparent concern or intervention, if free will is such a valued, holy thing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">The subject of free will is, indeed, paramount.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>From the galactic perspective, from the universal perspective, from the Christed perspective, there is only one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>By this we mean there is only one totality of energy, there is only one totality of consciousness, there is only unity. Unity disseminates into matter and into energy throughout the various strata of densification of the various layers and multitudes of energetic dimensional templates, which you experience, finally, in your third density as a kind of duality, as a kind of dualism, as a kind of positivity and negativity, love and hatred.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">At a very fundamental level, everything is part of everything else. Third density expression and experience—in order to graduate from this realm and into the less-encumbered fourth, fifth and sixth densities—one must come to a place of absolute neutrality within one’s self; a place of non-judgment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Meaning that even though there are those who would oppress, the 2%, the elitists, the historical figures of Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, etc, yes, objectively, from a third density perspective, these are evils. Yet, to fight an evil with the equal amount of hatred or vehemence does not eradicate it from your reality systems. It perpetuates the struggle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">How to, then, overcome evil?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Evil, objectively, must be overcome by a change in frequency in consciousness in each individual human being. In other words, when you, yourself, can stop judging another—that is not to say you agree with the actions of, for example, the young man who lost his sanity and killed all these people in Aurora, Colorado in the last few days—one does not have condone the actions of a person, nor agree with the actions, to cease judgment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Non-judgment means you cannot condemn the individual. You understand that the person, from whatever perspective, no matter how skewed or twisted or broken or deranged or pained or depressed they were, carried out an action which has consequences which they, themselves, will have to atone for.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Yes, they have set in motion a situation, circumstances, which have ramifications and perhaps deep, deep hurt for many, many others. This is not to say that one should not work against injustices. Obviously, it is a very good thing to work against injustices.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">But, what we are saying is different than social action; it is different than working as an environmental lawyer, for example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What we are saying is that at a very fundamental level, one must cease to judge, to condemn. One must cease to see the other as other, for the quote “nega-élites” are the flip-sides of yourselves; we all have reptilian cortexes in our brains. Any one of us, given the opportunity, could become just as oppressive as those who we judge to oppress.</span></p>

We would, however, recommend a small volume, a small book, which was written by a woman named Thea Alexander called “</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">2150 A</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">.D.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is a small science fiction book that specifically addresses this problem of non-judgmentalism in order to graduate this realm.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">There were many more questions tonight. If your question was not asked, then feel free to re-submit it next week just before the call. What’s happening is I’m getting more questions and more emails than I can possibly deal with, although I’m trying to. I used to read all the questions and we didn’t have so many and we could cover most of them. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Now, just in respect for my own time availability, I have to start looking at the questions maybe a half hour before the call. So if it comes in earlier than that, it will probably be left behind. If you keep sending questions, I will notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Particularly there are questions about health. There are questions about all kinds of things that I know are very important to you. I didn’t not ask it because it wasn’t important. I didn’t ask it because there is not enough time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">As you know, we are spending a lot of time and giving a lot of time, Daphne, myself and Terry, pro bono. I can’t let this call go on, this particular call, of channeling for hours on end. And one day, maybe, I will do a Saturday morning call, if Terry and Daphne agree, where we charge a small amount and we’ll do three hours of calls and only take enough people so we can handle all their questions during that call to justify all the time we spend. On that note, I do thank all of you who asked questions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">For the person who asked about the negative, it was a very interesting thing that came up in the Rueckert material that I thought I would share. That is, that in the Carla Rueckert Ra material, it was explained that one of the ways that free will was extended in the universe—she uses the word ‘logos’, and I believe her use of the word logos would be the same as our use of the word ‘Elohim’—it was the original first cause, maybe the one infinite Creator.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">Then, there was the logos, then there were sub-logos; sub-logos, sub-logos, sub-logo/logii. Humans are referred to as sub-sub-logii, or something like that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Each piece of the universe that developed had a consciousness, where it created the particular laws of its realm. For example, as I understood it, the sun would create certain laws of evolution within the solar system, and the earth would create certain laws of evolution within its surface.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">There were times when the sub-logii created environments that were very positive and that were very comfortable. What was said in the Ra material is that the evolution of the beings in that environment where everything was comfortable was extremely, extremely slow. The fastest way for beings to evolve into higher dimensions, into God-head, to graduate a realm, was when there was a mix of polarity between positive and negative. That created the thrust that caused people to grow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">So, from their point of view—this is my memory from what I understood about all of this—from their point of view, the goal is to create beings that graduate this realm and move up the ladder. That can take one lifetime, a thousand lifetimes; it could take beings moved from one planet to another, from one galaxy to another so that occurs. Making everyone comfortable doesn’t necessarily speed up that process. In fact, it might slow it down. So the interplay of negative and positive is the fastest way for that process to occur.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">The negative has the advantage in that it can cheat, control, whatever, and lie, and the positive has the advantage that we have the ability to have these group souls on our side by asking. So, there is this interplay in this realm, energetically, as I said earlier: Why do we keep asking for certain things?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s because we have the asset of having these huge, positive group soul sources to help us with our intentions. Their requirement is that we ask. Why is it that they ask? It’s because just in the nature of asking, we start to expand into the oneness of their realm; it begins that process.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">This is Wynn talking now; this is my take on this. They’re fulfilling their agenda of helping humans graduate and grow and move into this process of moving back to God-head. Just to do things, without creating that energy, they said, “We’ll just wait until they show up on another planet in another system” and then we’ll have more opportunities. Since they are outside of time, where time moves at a different space, they have a lot of patience. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">So that’s part of my take on this process. We might look at it, for example—maybe you know people like this—where somebody comes from the ranks and ends up being phenomenal and soulful and influencing loads of people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Whereas someone that comes from a wealthy family, that had all the finer things of life, ends up being a nobody. They’re rich, but they’re a nobody. They have no soul energy. They’re just floating along.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">If you’re into astrology, if you ever studied astrology, which I did at one time, there are influences which are easy which are called trines. There are influences which are difficult, which create conflict, which are called squares.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When we studied astrology, it was always said that if somebody had a lot of trines then they could not grow very much because their life was easy; things would come to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">If somebody had a lot of squares, a lot of conflicts in their chart, it would propel them, if they used the energy. The squares could be a propulsion into much greater growth. There’s a complexity to it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">That was a very good question, and I thank you for the question. Let’s just take a moment of silence and bring in the energies for personal healing, planetary healing. We all were connected; put your requests into your mind, and let’s see if they get picked up. We’ll just take a moment of silence…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-hyphenate: auto;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m letting you know we’re going to be doing a live event in Sedona, if you happen to be in the Sedona/Phoenix area. I did send out another email; I’m going to send another email out this evening. I hope if you’re in that area you’ll avail yourself to come hear us. Daphne will be on the phone most likely; Terry will be present. You will be able to ask questions during the day. In a live event—it’s going to go all day for like eleven hours, with a lunch and dinner break—there is usually a phenomenal energy in the room that helps speed processes up.</span></p>

Sometimes information may bleed through from the conscious mind of the channel. It is possible that a negative Source may interfere. Apply your own discernment, take only what resonates and discard the rest. An answer to a question is meant for the person asking the question and you have the privilege of listening in because sometimes you can gain insights from the answer. However, even though the circumstances may be similar, do not merely assume the answer applies to you.</span></p>
