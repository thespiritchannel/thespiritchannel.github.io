This is Wynn Free at 10:25 AM Pacific time on Sunday May 6, 2012. Welcome to our grid healing. This is where we stretch to make an energetic connection with our sources who say that they can flow energy into this realm in what they call love/light. On these calls we emphasize coming together and creating a group energy which includes all of us on this line, everyone listening to the replays, and however many of our sources join and participate with us. When we create a group energy we create group intentions for both personal and planetary healing and the group intentions are formulated by us and everything we ask for or put into the light is always for the highest good and honoring free will. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Understanding on our planet there's a balance going on between dark and light and our sources have to look at that balance and look at where the scales are because that's what allows them to do more or less interventions and we know they can do interventions. We know they can do things and shift things through working in the field that shift things in the physical. So we are focusing our intentions to shift things on the planet in a more positive way. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">On that note, I'm going to open it up to the people on the call to put in their light requests</span></span></p>

And this is just a heartbreaking story: There was a rare white buffalo calf that was born on a Texas ranch. His name was 'Lightning Medicine Cloud.' He was going to have his one year birthday and he was found dead and mutilated on the Texas ranch and his mother was found the next day. He was sacred to the Lakota Indian tribe as well as many other Indian tribes and many others. I like to send love and light to dear little 'Lightning Medicine Cloud and his mother and father who father a week earlier struck by lightning that hit him and the peaceful passing on to a happy place and they get their sacred message to the people that they needed to.

I wanted to say that seeing these things sometimes inspires fear where we feel either helpless or afraid and it's been very helpful to me any time I start to be crimped in upon with fear that I am reminded that I have the light to turn to and I actually find myself mumbling to these entities and I find it very comforting. So I just wanted to put into the light, the light source within every person that we know we can turn to when we feel fear.</span></span></p>

It is like an old home week where we greet individuals who we dearly love and it creates the opportunity for connection. We are mindful of the questions and the issues that you put into the light today. This is sacred moment in time that we come together and can nourish your connections, nourish yourself in the area of the dense third density where it is hard sometimes to feel nourished and loved and to know that you are not alone. We are there with you. We are there with each situation that each of you has put into the light. </span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We then look at the larger area of light workers everywhere and their desire to help and to bring light into the darkness that is in the third density and to shed light and to make it possible for individuals everywhere to have discernment. For the educational system to have people with discernment that are able to tell and how best to educate the children not only in the USA but in other countries as well. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We see in Uganda Carolyn’s fight to bring equity into the education system and to bring non-violence and to bring into the educational system the fostering of the children seeking education and the ability to discern. </span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We take a look at the Whales and the Dolphins and we see their energy is concerned with situations such as pollution, and such as magnetic changes in the direction of the North and South pole and magnetic north pole and that they may stabilize themselves as they are very resilient and very bright and they are sending us the information that in general they are dealing with these changes and that they are centering. Their love and their light transcend third density and keep them centered. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">And we then take a look at our friend Diana in Boca Raton that is now in New York.

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">For areas of tornado warnings we send moderation. We send love to angry forces that create the tornado. We send love for moderation. The heart of the love merges with tornadoes forming and knows their anger and that they are able to dissipate their anger without as much physical destruction. But yet we grant we have to honor free will.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We send love and light to Carolyn Sabin for the trip and for the healing process for her. </span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We thank Foster Gamble for his movie, that individuals see it and get some growth from hearing and seeing it. </span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We send love and light to Mother Earth.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">And the Constitutional re-establishing freedom. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We send love/light to Joanne and Carla Rueckert, and the animals and children everywhere. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">To Gijs's daughter we send rapid healing and we see that she is young and vital and has good healing ability. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">To bees everywhere send health and that the GMOs and pesticides that are hurting the bees and other beneficial creatures such as the bats that eat tons of harmful pests each year that these age old creatures need to be protected and these pesticides move into a place in the past where more common sense and discernment comes to individuals putting such things out. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">To battle fields we see there’s stuckness of individuals who have been caught in battle that not known how proceed as is true with individuals who have suddenly changed their path. It’s possible to resume the path and not remain idle or resentful. We send them shakti that they move and get back on their way. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span size="4">We thank each and every person on this line for your precious presence. You each are a treasure and we love you and are there for you. We leave but we do not leave. Adonai.</span></span></p>
