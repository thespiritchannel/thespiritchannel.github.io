I had picked a crop circle that had a picture of a gray. I assume all of you know what crop circles are, but if not, they are these strange perfectly symmetrical designs, very sophisticated designs that appear in England and other places but mostly in England and they appear over night. Many people think they are being made by ET’s. And we actually found out who is making the crop circles. This was an intense call. We actually had to cut it short because there were some ambient influences coming in on the call and I thought you might learn something by feeling how the energies feel of ambient influences.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

So, don’t believe it; just consider the possibilities. One of the things I had to learn in putting this out was: even if I came to the conclusion that it’s true it was not for me to tell you to believe it because I think it’s true. It’s something that you have to get your own resonance with, and we give you plenty of opportunity to do that.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

There are a lot of opportunities to be fearful, to be alienated, to be separated. On this call there’s an energy that comes in from a higher dimensions, I believe it does. That’s the only way I can explain it - that gives you a sense of connection and continuity and support through this shift our planet’s going through.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Some are graduating and some are repeating. People are making those choices, but they don’t know they’re making it. That’s the way it seems to work. Just connecting with the positive energy, getting rid of your fear, are two things which greatly enhance the potentials of graduating this realm during this lifetime.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Please read it, because half the book is my conversations with this source that says they’re the Elohim and I ask them questions. They answer me and they give their take on how things work – it’s very interesting. Many people have just read the book and gotten triggered by reading it. They’ve said their energy is in their words. If that’s true, reading the book – of course, half the book is their words - so, it gives you an opportunity to tap into their energy.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

I thank Daniel Davis for sending me a UTube which I actually took the time to watch, and I decided it was going to be a good topic. During the course of this call, we’re going to learn stuff that perhaps no one else knows about the origins of crop circles, because we have access to this unusual source of information. They may not want to tell us; but I didn’t do a dress rehearsal and say to them: “Are you guys willing to talk about this?” If they don’t, we’ll have to change the subject; but, I think they will.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">If you’re not aware of what crop circles are, you can certainly do a Google search on it.

The designs are geometrical; the designs are … I’m looking at some pictures here. I’ll read a little bit about crop circles so it can set the stage:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span color="#000000">“</span><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Crop circles come in many different shapes. The most basic is a single circle. Circles may also come in sets of two, three and four. The stalks inside a crop circle are typically known as swirl pattern; I should mention that crop circles are usually pretty big, sometimes hundreds of feet across, and they appear overnight. The stalks inside of a crop circle are typically bent into what is known as a swirl pattern, and the circles may spin clockwise or counter-clockwise.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">In patterns with several circles, one circle may spin clockwise and another counter-clockwise. Crop circles can range in size from a few inches to a few hundred feet across. Many early crop circles were simple circular designs, but after 1990 they became more elaborate. More complex crop patterns, called pictograms, emerged. Crops can be made to look like just about like anything – smiling faces, flowers, or even words. Sometimes they have unique designs, but they can also be based on ancient motifs. Some of the more sophisticated patterns are based on mathematical equations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

It’s very rarely in the news; nonetheless, what is causing these crop circles? Where do they come from? People have speculated about this for years. Many people think that it’s ETs in flying saucers that are communicating with us.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">While I was writing </span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4"><i>The</i></span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4"> </span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4"><i>Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce</i></span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">, if you have that book, you’ll notice on the back of the book is the picture of a crop circle. In that crop circle, it’s the design of the winged bird that represented Ra in</span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4"> </span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Egypt.

<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">I did a channeling at that time and we asked about it – I can’t remember – I think it was through Terry. I said, “Who is making the crop circles?” and they said, “By and large, the Ra group.” Of course, the Ra group is the group I was talking about earlier that’s composed of beings that graduated this realm [and] got off the wheel of reincarnation. They’re a huge group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">It’s hard to imagine how they are; I asked questions about it and they said they were like a template of energy spread through the Solar System and the universe.” In other words, they were part of the energetic flow and they have the ability to work as a team and talk to people down here. They have the ability to do other things as well. I don’t know all the limitations and the extent of what they can do or not do; I don’t know all the limitations of what the Elohim can do or not do. We know they most definitely can do things that couldn’t be done by the normal laws of the physical universe.</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">For example, the Ra group can disable weapons from going off; I don’t know if the Elohim can do that. Maybe they could but they don’t, because it’s in the hands of the Ra group. One of their criterions, both groups, is they honor free will. They don’t intrude on our evolution unless we ask them. Most people, if they knew such groups really existed, they’d be asking.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Most people don’t know they exist. It’s okay if you just ask God; that will end up going into their realm and they can answer that, I believe. Most people aren’t even sure that there is something called God. Part of the work we’re doing is convincing people they exist so that if you ask for something that there really is someone up there that can answer and help.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">They don’t like to be thought of as God. You can see how easily the idea of God came about, since you have this invisible source that honors free will; their criteria is you must ask for something to happen. That easily could turn into giving up your power into some nameless, faceless mystery that we call God. That’s okay, because the idea of God in a traditional sense may not be the most accurate visualization, but its close enough so that it works. They have described something that is called the One Infinite Creator, or maybe the first cause, the initial cause. The Elohim were break-aways from the One Infinite Creator. We’ve already had many calls talking about that. So we’re not going to go into again today; today’s topic is crop circles.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">What provoked me to pick this topic for tonight is this video that Daniel sent me. In the video, I sent the link out today; I suggest you look at it. There was some kind of signal that was sent into space some years ago with the idea of seeing if there’s any intelligence out that would answer that signal.</span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4"> </span></span></span><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">It was a radio signal of some sort. Years later, there was a crop circle that seemingly answered the signal. There was a coded kind of pictograph on the signal they were sending out, and this crop circle appeared and it had the same pictograph on it. There was, adjoining to this pictograph, there was the face of a gray. Shortly thereafter, there was another crop circle with another face of a gray and there was something that they were able to translate; I don’t know how they translated this. I’m not an expert on crop circles. There is a lady I do know who is an expert; maybe I’ll have her on the show some time.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">The picture had a gray – do you know what a gray is? – that’s like an alien that looks like one of David Spielberg’s aliens from Close Encounters or from E.T. -those guys with big eyes and rounded heads. We’ve had a lot of experience studying grays and asking some questions about grays. According to our information, Terry’s and mine and different sources I cross-referenced, the grays were a dying race. Somehow they got radioactive on their home planet and it affected their genes and their ability to reproduce. So, they have to reproduce themselves by cloning. The clones were getting weak and they were going to die out as a race if they didn’t figure out some way to fix this.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="3"><span color="#000000"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4">For some period of time, they have been doing hybrids with humans. When you hear about abductions, it’s usually – one source of abductions – the grays who are doing hybrids and creating hybrid babies with the idea of incarnating into them so their race doesn’t die.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Now there’s a picture of a gray in a crop circle with a message sent out to space. I may not have this exactly right, but there’s another picture of a gray with a message coming back. There was some way they translated this and it said “Beware of those that….” I really should read this directly, I’m paraphrasing. “Beware of those that seem to come to help you because they have an agenda.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Number one, it can be scary; and number two – they might be thinking I’m wackier than I was. I have to take the risk of people thinking that. If you explore these things, there is a lot of stuff on the internet backing it up.

This is something that if there’s any remote truth to that, you’re going to want to do your own study and see about that because one day you may have to make a decision, and you’re going to need this kind of information to make that decision.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

These alien beings have been having an extremely hard time and have been seeking to make inroads into the siphoning off of the resources of planet Earth and the furthering of their race and their children and they consider their life as dependent upon the resources. They have grief in that they are fearful that they may not be able to survive, and they have shame in that they have not been able to perpetuate their race in the manner that is so desirous, and they have grief in that they are backed up against the wall. This is the heart and root of some of the agendas that they are seeking to surreptitiously or otherwise to infiltrate and bring to pass. They seek the survival of their children, and they seek the survival of their race. They feel that they need the race of humans to bring sustenance and strength and new genes into their race. Their actions, at some level, are a plea for help.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

We see that loving your enemy like your friend, if it is done right, considering that they are backed against the wall, that you need awareness in how to deal with them and in seeing their vibrations, as you need to approach them with the knowledge that they’re backed against the wall and as one of the species of humans, alien humans, they have the fight/flight response.

Yet, they feel the grief of the loss of it upon the future of their race and feel the solution is to create new genes, and better DNA. They are very intelligent and they have had the emotions, to some degree, bred out of them. They seek to survive with technology and smarts, and they desperately need emotion and caring, as their bodies do not hold that; their bodies have been programmed to be the sharpest and smartest and to override emotion, yet they feel the emotion of loss.

We’re going to create a new moment, a brand new moment, right at this moment where we bring in the highest realms of light projecting through the realms, through all of us and into the earth and re-birth this moment into a new moment and that all of you do that and clear the space right now, and establish that connection. Take a moment and bring in the energy from the center of the universe, through the galaxies, through the planets, through the earth, through our bodies and into the earth.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"><span size="4">Over and out; this is Wynn Free and Terry Brown on our Monday Night conference call.</span></span></p>

Let’s do it silently. Let’s just bring in the light, as we do create a group energy of all of us here, bring in our sources to the group energy. Shut your eyes and feel the energy of the connection through the top of your head and just make sure that your intent is to go all the way up high and not anywhere in a half way zone. We want to separate ourselves from that call and the energies of that call. So at this moment let’s telepathically think of those situations that we would like to put in the light, ourselves, our friends the planet, our family, and we’ll just take a moment of silence for everyone to do that. And we’ll see you all next time. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
