<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Wynn:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>Hello, everybody this is Wynn Free and we are starting our Sunday grid healing. Here we go. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">On our Sunday call, we have this rather unique premise, that I don’t really like to say out loud because people might chase me around the block, but there are enough people sensing it might be true, that there is an Intelligence that explains themselves to be a group energy outside of time at the beginning of creation. This intelligence has the ability to project energy through all the matrices and arrive in this realm and you, as a </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">human</span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">, have the ability, the potential, to feel their energy when they do that. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">This call is focused on that experience and then on creating group intentions to work with that energy. There is this idea that physical reality, what we see with our senses, is far more than just physical. For example, if you’re into energy healing, people would say that if you’re going to heal the body, it starts off with working with the energies that are outside the body, and if you can change the energy </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">outside </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">the body, then that energy change </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">outside </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">of the body will shift in the body and the body will </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">heal</span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Now, that’s a nice idea, but it’s easier said than done because most of us have a hard time </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">accessing </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">the energy that’s outside our body. Well, when we start working with the idea of being outside of our body that is a concept that does not end because how far outside of your body can you be? Could you be </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">just </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">right outside in what’s called the etheric field around your body? Or could you be at the center of the universe? Could you be [in] all those places? How does it feel to be in different </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">places</span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Well, what is happening on this call is that we are learning how to be outside of our body at a far higher place than most of us have ever experienced. We’re talking to an intelligence that’s outside of our body. Now I am not telling you this is true, but </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">they </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">explain that they are at the beginning of everything. They are outside of </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">time</span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">. They are at the beginning of the creation of the universe. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So now, when we make a connection from them to us, all the space in between has the potential to get healed, as long as we’re are not </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">violating </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">anybody else’s free will!<span>&nbsp; </span>Your body can heal by changing the energy outside of it. We’ve had a number of people who have been on this line that have experienced some kind of healing. Sometimes the healing is physical, sometimes it’s in an attitude, sometimes it’s a really deep emotional problem that clears, but all these things start outside your body, and then they download. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So, as you tune into these energies, as you access them, you now are starting a process of potentially healing yourself. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">The planet is exactly a big YOU. It is a physical </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">body </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">that has all kinds of distortions in its energy field outside of itself. Some of those distortions are us. We are probably the major cause of the distortions on the planet, because, since we as humans are all in the field of the planet, however our field is, it changes the field of the planet. Of course, we do damage to the natural resources. I don’t know everything, but there are a lot of things that humans do that are hurtful to Earth.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So, on this call, we create a group energy between ourselves and those positive sources in other realms and then we project this energy into ourselves and we also project it around the planet. We are dealing with a lot of stuff that is invisible. We cannot see what is going on. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We have two criteria when we do this:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">(1) That everything is for the highest good of all concerned. In other words, when we ask for a shift--perhaps you are sick, or something is going wrong because you are supposed to learn a lesson and somebody took that disease away before you learned the lesson, you would lose the opportunity to learn the lesson and that might not be for the highest good of all concerned. It’s true for us and it’s true for the planet.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">(2) We don’t violate the free will of anyone.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So if we inadvertently ask for anything that is not for the highest good of all concerned, or that should violate the free will of someone else, then automatically we don’t want those things to occur. We don’t understand all the implications of what we are asking. So those are our protection things so we keep it high and mighty. This is how our sources explained this to us.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So we have a group energy that is us, all of you on the line, all of you who listen and our sources who are far bigger than us and are more plentiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are millions of them, I do not know how many of them come on the line, but they add to our energy as long as we use the criteria that I just explained: for the good of all concerned and not violating free will. So, that’s why a call like this can be so be so powerful because we are leveraging ourselves tremendously and miraculous things can occur because of that leveraging of energy because from their perspective, they need someone down here to ask.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Now as I understand it, you don’t have to say, “Ra-An, could you help us?” You can say, “God, can you help us?” They read the </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">intent </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">of the energy, not the accuracy of the identification, so we’re part of the many people in this process, but this happens to be particularly powerful because of, not only feeling the energy, not only probably having one of the more accurate understandings of how they are so we can visualize them better, but they </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">talk </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">to us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We are very blessed and honored to have Terry who has dedicated herself to this and maintains an extremely pure intent so that I never feel that we have a mixed polarity source. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">That’s one of the things about channeling, how do you know the same source is coming through today as last week as the week before? How do you know it is positive and continues to be positive? The only way we have of telling that by is by keeping very high intent and then constantly monitoring the source to make sure the energy feels consistent and the point<span>&nbsp; </span>feels consistent. The positive sources that I deal with never create hierarchy. They never create better than. They don’t say they’re better than us. They happen to be in a different location in the universe. They never say we should prostrate before them. They say they want to be our friends and that they can be our energy friends, and they can work with us as long as we’re operating with a high intent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We have the opportunity to meet them and greet them and become friends with them on these </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">calls </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">we do. So everyone has to have their own experience. We’re just providing this and telling you we’ve been watching it now for awhile and everything I am saying seems to work because of the experiences people are having, not because they say so, not because I say so, but you guys, who are coming in on the line all the time and emailing me about how this has impacted you, are proving to me that, “Hey, what we think is happening is happening.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">If you’re new on the line and you’re just listening for the first time, consider the possibility that all I say is true, but don’t believe it. Just keep checking in and gauge your own experience. Make it your experiment, and the experiment is, “Can I connect with these energies that are in other realms and feel them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is it loving and are they my friend?”<span>&nbsp; </span>By the way, very simply speaking, if you happen to be sophisticated metaphysically, you’ve heard the term “getting off the wheel of reincarnation, graduating from this realm.” Well, one of the ways that you do those two things is by making energetic connections with things that are not physical, that are positive, of course, because you can make energetic connections with things that are negative also, but if you can make energetic connection with positive intelligence that is not on this planet, that is not embodied, then when you die you will still have those connections.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those connections, all energetic connections, continue with you from lifetime to lifetime to lifetime. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So if, for example, when you die, you’re all tied into energies of this planet like “I love my family. I need to get successful.” I mean it’s not that you don’t love your family, the point is you have to connect your energies to your family as well as to the higher realms because if it is just to your family, you will reincarnate to come back to that family, and that’s okay. This is all the free will choice of everyone. I am just telling you this is how I understand that it works. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So, if you want to graduate this realm, then learn to connect with energies that are outside of this realm and then bring those energies into your family so they can feel them and everyone will graduate, but if you are holding your energy down to be with your family and you are not doing this other thing, then you will keep repeating this realm to be with that family for maybe millions of years. Now that’s not right or wrong, maybe that’s exactly what you choose to do. And, you know, you may decide a million years from now, “Well, we finally got it right, I got my family connected to the higher realms,” and you’ll </span><i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">graduate </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">from this realm. In the universe even though when I say a million years, it seems like an incredibly long time, a million years…time does not exist, so a million years doesn’t even exist. So it is all the perspective of how you look at it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">The way they look at it and the way they explain it is, “Well, it’s just one lifetime of many. It’s one opportunity. You’ll get another chance 75,000 years from now or 300,000 years.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Since they are out of time,<span>&nbsp; </span>since they are not in time, it can take 300,000 years. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So there we go again, it’s 300,000 years later. When you experience all your lifetimes, you are not aware that you are in time. You are not aware that you are stuck in time unless you meet some guy like me that says, “You’re stuck in time,” or you listen to Joni Mitchell’s song, “Captured by the Carousel of Time.” She was obviously very wise when she looked at that line, but most people just go through lifetime after lifetime and it doesn’t feel like a trap. It feels like, “This is my experience.”<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">ISSUES TO PUT INTO THE LIGHT:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So in any case, so much for me talking.<span>&nbsp; </span>So what are we going to put in the light today?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Jody:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Hi, this is Jody from Indiana. I just would like to put into the light—it kind of goes along with what you were talking about--anyone out there who is seeking a connection to find their way to your call or to find a way to a connection to the higher realms. Did you understand that? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Wynn:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>I understand it exactly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let’s put it in the light so they can find the connections, okay?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Wynn:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>I just want to say one thing. You know one of the things that helps people find the connection is putting things out into the world kind of in a broadband way so that that there is clues to it, so the people that it’s right for, gravitate towards it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">The only way that people have found this group is because I have done that consistently, and every one of you that does that a little bit is going to make a difference. If you notice, I’ve been sending out [things], I may not have sent these out enough and I will send them out again this week. I’ve made some videos that introduce my book and message-a-day to people. I’ve made these new sign-up sheets. I am experimenting with different kinds of sign-up sheets for message-a-day. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So, when I send these things out to you, send them out to other people and let it just fall where it may. You don’t have to try to explain it. You don’t have to endorse it. In fact, what I have found is that in most cases if people try to talk about what we do to someone else, it’s too far out--they get excluded, they get whackoed. Send something that just makes somebody curious and let them know, “I got a lot out of this, check it out, just read this guy’s messages every day for a month and if it doesn’t work for you, unsubscribe.” That way you’re not invested in whether they like it or not. You’re not overly endorsing it. For the people that it’s right, they will gravitate towards it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Please take advantage of those tools, whether it’s the videos or the sign-up sheets or whatever and think what a person would be interested in. I am going to make one thing:<span>&nbsp; </span>“Introduction for message-a-day” and say, “Please come to our Sunday Grid Healing and then sign up here to get the number,” and then they’ll be in message-a-day. Or another one: “’The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce,’ get excerpts from the book, sign up here and you’re in message-a-day,” and different approaches. Some approaches will reach some people, some will reach another. I’ll just keep putting them out and if you guys keep sending them out and sharing them, people will show up that need this. And that’s all.</span></p>

I want to give you an update. Last week I brought up a little baby girl who had fallen and hurt her brain and blood was pooling behind her eyes and she was going downhill fast and they said she might die. I heard Monday, I didn’t hear until Monday, that she began suddenly to stabilize, that they are weaning her off all the drugs and off the life support tubes but they said she’s going to be blind and brain damaged, but brain damage is not as serious as they had thought, but I would like to continue to hold her in the light.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Now, we’re going to do our visualization. If you’re on the line for the first time and you’re new on the line, this is one of those things where we’re moving energy. For some of you you’ll feel the energy move, and some of you may just hear the words. If you’re just hearing the words and you have no experience of energy moving, then just be patient and keep going through this and listening to it because this is not a trivial thing to move your energy. All of us have lived for probably many lifetimes with our energy within a certain framework of matrix. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">When you go to move your energy, there can be a lot of resistance. There can be, first of all, mental doubt.<span>&nbsp; </span>There can be fear--where am I moving to. There can be trauma that has locked the energy up in your body. There can be a belief pattern that it’s not possible. It’s okay not to have the experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just hear my voice and just be neutral.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don’t try. Don’t not try. It’s probably the best mode to have the experience of<span>&nbsp; </span>feeling this energy move and feel the connections.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So we’re going to start and I’m going to ask everyone to take their shoes off if they can. Be sure you are in a quiet room. Put your feet on the floor and we’re going to bring the energy up from the center of the Earth through the floor and into our feet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Now we said earlier thar just like our bodies have an etheric energy all around us, the Earth is exactly like us in the sense of energy. It has a field around it and we are in the field of the Earth. We’re so used to being in it that we don’t feel it. We don’t’ feel her. Or we are disconnected from it because even though we are in it, only a small part of us is connected. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So right now we’re going to make a major connection with the Earth. When you feel that energy coming into your feet, some of you can feel a tingle. Some of you can feel it. So it is a finger of energy coming from the earth, through your feet, through your legs, through your calves, through your genitals, through your solar plexus, through your stomach, through your chest, through your neck, through your head. We will stop for a moment at the top of our heads. So we have a finger of energy from the Earth all the way through the top of our head. Feel it?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Let’s say hello to the Earth and tell her we love her. This is not trivial. You know telling the Earth you love her might help stop an earthquake in your area, because if the Earth loves you back, she’s going to say, “We don’t want to do an earthquake in San Francisco. We love Laurie.” This is real. There may not be the opportunity to make that decision, because maybe it’s just too far gone. But if you connect with the Earth, and she connects back with you then you have a consciousness under your feet, that is working on your behalf.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we are greeting the Earth, loving the Earth. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We are going to move our energy now through our heads, remember we stopped at the top of our heads? And go above our heads, and we see ourselves one foot above our head. We have gone through what is called our crown chakra and we’re above our head and now we are going to keep moving and we are going to get higher and higher and higher. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">There is a place where all our energies combine. We connect with each other. When we meet that place we have gone through the veil of the planet. We are above the veil. Now, one of the tricky things here is because you are above the veil does not mean you can see what’s above the veil. It’s not like when you look through a curtain you can see what’s on the other side. You’re above the veil with your energy but your body is still in this realm. So you can’t see what’s above there. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">It’s tricky, because if you lose your positive intent you could pick up negative things which are above the veil. So you don’t want to mess with this process. You want to keep it really highly intended. You want to keep the Law of One and Christed energies around it because if you just become a- phenomena-and-curiosity-seeker and lose that [high intention], you can get negatively attacked. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So we are now creating a group energy above the veil. We are inviting our sources, who explain themselves to be huge group energies, to join with our group energy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">They tell us they are watching us during this call.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re going to talk in just a moment, so, we are not just dealing with anonymous intelligence. One of the ways that this call has occurred is because of all the conversations I have had with them. So now, we have this huge group energy above our body, us and them.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this part of the call we are going to bring that energy back down. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">If you recall, I said earlier when you connect way up there and then you bring it down you have the opportunity to heal the energies that have been distorted in your matrix. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Remember time doesn’t exist, so when we talk about going back in time, there is no back in time. It’s all here right now, and so right now the place exists where we were all One prior to separating, because they both exist--the place of Oneness and the place of Separation. Well, we’re going back to the place of oneness. We’re moving back to the place before we separated, right now.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So we’re recreating ourselves from that place.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now we’re going to travel back down through the matrices, which may be hundreds of thousands of years of lifetimes. We’re going to travel down them from the place before all those matrices got distorted . Wherever there is permission to do healing on that in your matrix, ask for it, because, in essence, it’s the higher part of yourself healing the lower part of yourself. So this is not some external force doing this. It is YOU doing it to your SELF, but from the place that you do not normally access of yourself. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So we’re bringing the energy down and we’re plugged into this huge area that existed before we got screwed up and we’re going to plug it in and move it down through the top of our head. (breaths deeply) Aaaaahhh. Can you feel that energy in your head?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Notice the difference in feeling from when we brought the energy of the Earth up and when we bring the energy of celestial realm down. Feel your head. Feel<span>&nbsp; </span>energy all around your head.<span>&nbsp; </span>Can you see<span>&nbsp; </span>light in your third eye and your brain?<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So now, take a moment and have that energy work with anywhere that’s distorted, out-of-balance, in your head.<span>&nbsp; </span>Move it around.<span>&nbsp; </span>Send it to your brain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Send it to your ears.<span>&nbsp; </span>Send it to your third eye and your forehead.<span>&nbsp; </span>Send it to your eyes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe you don’t have good circulation in your eyes.<span>&nbsp; </span>See the circulation right now improving.<span>&nbsp; </span>Send it to your nose and to your mouth.<span>&nbsp; </span>Cavities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let’s get rid of cavities.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Now if I miss a place where you know you have problems, you be sure and think of that problem and send this energy to the problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>Down your neck to your chest, and into your heart and your lungs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let’s see the physical heart and the lungs operating.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let’s take a deep, deep, deep breath. Aaaahhhh. Let it out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We see the heart, the arteries, the plaque.<span>&nbsp; </span>The plaque is dispersing.<span>&nbsp; </span>The heart is beating.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s beating a good rhythm.<span>&nbsp; </span>And we’ll work with the energy of the heart.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">You know, according to our sources, in order to graduate this realm your heart energy needs to be open slightly more than half.<span>&nbsp; </span>So let’s start releasing stuff around our heart to get this energy open.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So to begin with, let’s look at what you might be holding in your heart. Whom do you have resentment for? Put them in the front of your mind and forgive them. Who has really done you in in this lifetime? Who has really taken advantage of you and you really have this huge anger and hate for them somewhere inside you? Let’s let it go. Look at that situation and silently say, “I forgive you.” Now this doesn’t mean you have to be somebody’s friend. You may never talk to them again but if you’re holding them in your heart, that might be the 2% that keeps you from graduating, okay? So let it go! Don’t hold them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">All that stuff is taking up the percentage of your heart that’s holding you in this realm. So you are letting these things go for yourself. Think of the lovers that rejected you, have you forgiven them? Are you still holding anger and hurt for them in your heart? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Remember you may not have been so good. Think of all these things that you’ve done to other people and forgive yourself. Try not to keep doing them, but forgive yourself for what you’ve done that brought hurt and pain to other people<span>&nbsp; </span>If you understand what you’ve done, you don’t have to do it again. You don’t have to repeat hurting, that hurt. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We’ll go down to our solar plexus, stomach, the center of our digestion. Let’s see if we can feel our whole digestive canal from our mouth through our esophagus through our stomach through our colon and out through the rear end or whichever part it is coming out.<span>&nbsp; </span>Feel the whole energy in that system and cleanse it. This is a very important system. If part of it is not flowing, figure out what in your life you are doing that is affecting that part. Maybe you are not taking things in and assimilating them. Maybe you’re rigid. I would bet If you’ don’t take things in, you’re not open to things in a receptive way. You may not be able to assimilate food.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can’t digest it and break it down properly. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">If your’ not releasing stuff, you may be constipated. You may have noted sometimes when you do something like clean up your house, you may have a really good release afterwards, or you call somebody that you meant to call and suddenly the energy is free afterwards. Watch and notice these things.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Of course, the solar plexus is the seat of power. It’s where you radiate your power energies, third chakra power energy. If people move into your space, and they invade your psychic space, then your third chakra energy may not be strong enough. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Let’s strengthen it right now. Let’s just see that energy. Imagine the energy coming from your third chakra ten feet around you. Somebody walks near you, they feel that energy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">People that study martial arts are taught to strengthen their third chakra. People say that if you study martial arts and you become a master of it, when you walk around in the world, people feel that energy and they don’t mess with you. They don’t even have to know that you studied martial arts. Why is that?<span>&nbsp; </span>They are taught to hold the energy of their third chakra and when you feel the energy of somebody’s third chakra it demands that you respect that and keep the space and honor the space of that person. You feel their power. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We go down to our genitals, our second chakra, and it is said that the second chakra is both sex and creativity. Sometimes when people are operating in high creative modes they don’t have their sexual needs as strong. Creating babies, creating life is all part of the second chakra, and it is also a built-in system to everyone’s body that they have to learn to deal with, to accept and figure out, “What is the right way of dealing with that energy in me?” From the universe’s point of view there is no right or wrong. The only right or wrong is not to hurt people. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We go down to the root chakra and we’ll connect that to the Earth. We go to our legs and do the same thing, connect it back to the Earth. </span></p>

When your body disappears from this realm those energies will be YOU.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let’s just take them in. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Ask again, if there’s any part of you needs healing.

We see the pressure rise, the pressure of this methane bubble increasing. Then we do another take and we picture the bubble being less in size, and we picture the bubble shrinking. We take a minute to picture this…we picture the Gulf returning to warmth and we picture the Gulf with clear water instead of with chemical pollutants in areas that are killing the porgies and the shellfish and taking all the oxygen and not allowing a life-giving sustenance within the water. We picture the water being crystalline clear and hold that as an image for the water to return to. Hold it as an image for the chemicals to leave. Hold it as an image for proper viscosity of the water to return and proper temperature of the water to return to re-establish the warmth in the Gulf Stream flowing to the Northern countries. </span></p>

It has a place and it needs discretion in using the ego. And one needs to be able to turn it off when it is getting in the way and it is taking over. And one needs to be able to moderate it, turn it down and to turn it off in order to be vulnerable and to fulfill their deepest desires. We place that as a concept that individuals may of their own free will in their own time choose as an option.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">PLANETARY HEALING:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We’re going to continue with the final section of our call, where we invoke our own group energy and send it to our planet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">What we do is we move back to that place that we created. Of course, when I say move back, we move the focus of our attention back because that place has always been there. It will always be there. It will be there when the call is over, but we are consciously putting our intention on that place --where we were existed before we separated, which exists right now.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So by doing that we are now able to look at the Earth from that place and you can just use your imagination and imagine this might be true. You don’t have to believe it. We see the Earth, and we are all in this group energy with our sources looking at the Earth, at a sphere in space. We can imagine this little string of energy that goes from that group energy going down to where we are individually. See that little string going from the group down to your body and look at your body from up there instead of looking at it up there from down there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Just use your imagination to do this. You don’t have to believe it. You don’t have to disbelieve it. And from this group energy, from this vantage point, we are going to send beams of light down to Earth, with giant flashlights, laser beams, and we’ll start out with the waters of the Earth, the oceans, the rivers, the lakes and the tap water. And we are beaming down on all the oceans sending love light energy into the water, changing the crystalline formations, lifting the vibrations, clearing the toxins, especially when we move to Gulf Stream and however we can add something. We can visualize the loop current flowing. Let’s do that right now.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">So we go from oceans, to the water in our tap, to the bottles of water in our refrigerator and let’s just charge them all up with positive energy</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We’ll go to the land masses, to the mountaintops as our reference points and we are going to focus energy into all the mountains, the Alps, the Andes, Yellowstone, Glacier National Park, Yosemite, The Rocky Mountains, so many mountain ranges all over our planet, the Andes….and we can just beam our flashlights into all these mountains, bringing in this new paradigm of energy to the Earth. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Keep in mind when we do this, we are healing just as when we bring our own energy source back into our body and we are healing the energies in between.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s exactly what we are doing here.<span>&nbsp; </span>We don’t have to even understand it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">The gridlines are all the energies around our planet that can become deactivated and do not allow the energy to flow anymore.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We go to the plants, the trees, that are all over our planet that are reaching up. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Okay. now let’s go to humans--light workers. What is a light worker? A light worker is anyone that has created a desire to be of service in their life who has become sensitive and aware of these higher energies and has taken a personal degree of responsibility to be a transmitter of these energies into this realm, which makes all of you light workers; because this is exactly what we are doing now and all those other beings all over our planet who are doing this, who are reaching to do this. We can join with them and they can join with us at a high-self level, and energetically connect with the work we are all doing. We can support them, they can support us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">And the indigo and crystal kids, who all came into this realm that are here and don’t know why they are here, let’s send them love and light and energy.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">You know, when you look at a picture of a person in church with their eyes shut and praying even though they may be using a model which has certain distortions in it, within the model, there still is the potential for the real connection because it encourages them to have a high intent to reach for God. You can see the energy in some of the pictures coming through the top of their heads and they are making the connection.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Let’s send the light now to the fault lines of our planet. Surround every fault line with love light energy and balancing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Let’s just see ourselves up in our perched group energy radiating energy to that entire area, the whole area, bathed in love light. Every place there is an earthquake fault that we find it and surround it so it can be neutralized to the greatest good of all concerned, to a place where if it goes off, it does minimum damage and it’s off the area of major populations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Now let’s go to the [Mid-]Atlantic ridge,<span>&nbsp; </span>St. Louis, the New Madrid fault and all those fault lines on our planet that we don’t even know about.. Let’s just move up to our perch and send this light energy down, to find those areas, to find them, to let our sources help us find them and balance them. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We know we’re going to have earthquakes. We know we’re going to have upsets. So we can’t fix that. We can mitigate perhaps some of the more disastrous incidents or put them off until we have more time to deal with it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">And droughts, any place there’s not water and rain. Let’s ask for rainfall and let’s ask for a flow in a manner that is not causing mudslides, not causing floods, but gentle flow of consistent rain that helps the crops and fills the reservoirs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Let’s in particular send the light to the Israeli Middle East situation, the Iranian situation,. We know there was a danger of something happening there.<span>&nbsp; </span>It hasn’t happened. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">To North Korea for the highest good, Pakistan, let’s just go to everywhere in the world that people are suffering because of any reason.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let’s send the light to those suffering and experiencing inequities for there to be upliftment of energy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">And right now let’s ask for interventions. One of the biggest interventions that you can have is blocking the energy of fear from the collective. One of the thoughts of the negative is to create so much fear that we’re paralyzed. Let’s surround the collective with a protective one way mirror that bounces fear off of it and lets love light through it. Let’s focus on that, right now. We’re going to create a shield. We think big here.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">If the collective goes into fear and holds fear, that will be a very difficult thing to recover from.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is nothing more important than protecting the collective and keeping ourselves out of fear because once we are in fear we can be controlled.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Okay, let’s ask for interventions in the breakdown of toxic materials in chemtrails; molecular restructuring of chemtrails, so any viruses, toxic materials, anything that is harmful for humans is disassembled.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Let us ask for interference to any frequencies in our air waves that are designed to control us. Any reverse energies that can break up those controlling vibrations which we know is happening, which are being broadcast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Let’s<span>&nbsp; </span>ask for disabling of any nuclear weapons that might be about to go off. The fuses turned off, they won’t operate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Let’s ask for disabling of any nefarious plots of the negative that are not in the highest good of all concerned that abuse the free will of all those other people. Where free will of the few is abridged by the majority, we ask for interventions to block plots of mal intent against the minority.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">On that note let’s come back to ourselves. Remember everything exists simultaneously so we have actually never left ourselves and when we come back to yourself, we never leave our group energy. It’s all existing at one time. But for the moment, we will take our focus of attention to ourselves and now we go back to our little bodies and looking back up at our group energy, just a moment ago we were looking down on the planet from the group energy, so we go back to our little bodies and we are now the recipients of this energy we created earlier. We shut our eyes and go back a moment to the experience of the connection to the energy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Remember when we hang up from this call, you still can access that.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s all there waiting for you, your little pin-prick of a body, living in your little city, that’s connected to this huge hologram of energy and you are helping to anchor that energy in your physical life on this planet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">In fact, for many of you that is the reason you are here, These calls have reminded you. “Wow! That makes sense, I didn’t really fit in,” You didn’t. You came here to do this, and now you are doing it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">You are the wanderers, the star seeds, and the light workers and this was your purpose, to anchor these energies. People ask, “What am I here for? What am I supposed to do?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Realize when you start to make this connection, whatever you do, you are always doing it. You are connecting these energies. You are lifting the vibration of the physical world in your local geography. By coming in on these calls, you are creating the same energy even in a bigger way all over our planet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Please get some more people on these calls. Do not explain to them what it is. Just tell them to check it out.. You know, the less you talk to people [the better,] what I’ve learned is to keep it simple. Just keep it really simple. Just say, “Hey, check it out!” Make people curious, but don’t try to explain it to them because you’ll just get tongue tied and they won’t understand it. But if they get on the call and they feel the energy, that‘s what they need. They need to feel the energy. You can’t put this in their mind and try to get it across, but you can drag them to the call, even conference them in, and give them the opportunity to check it out. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">While we have this space, take an extra moment, ask for any healings you need for yourself, send this energy to people you connect with, any healings for them. Any circumstances of your life, ask for synchronicities to come. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Okay, thank you everybody who was on the call, and everybody who’s listening, all those people in other countries. We are so grateful to have you supporting what we are doing.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">We’ll see you again tomorrow night. By the way, tomorrow night is going to be Carla Ruekert and myself. I haven’t figured out a topic yet but we will be on at 6 pm Pacific on www.bbs.com and on the phone line. There will be another notice on message-a-day telling you about it, to remind you. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%;" arial="" sans-serif="">Our Wednesday calls are getting more and more interesting. I can tell you, people are sending really, really great questions. It’s really one way of validating what we are doing--listening to the Wednesday calls and listening to the way our sources are answering the questions because we have to imagine where are those answers coming from. Listen regularly.<span>&nbsp; </span>It helps program your doubtful, skeptical mind that this can be real which is an easy thing to doubt.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s pretty far out.<span>&nbsp; </span>On that note, I’m turning off the tape recorder. Good bye everyone.</span></p>
