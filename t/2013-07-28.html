<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Good morning everybody, this is <st1:date year="2013" day="28" month="7" w:st="on">July 28, 2013</st1:date>. This is Sunday morning and we’re all coming as we are. It’s interesting, this morning I got out of bed … now I’m one of those people, when I get out of bed in the first 5 or 10 minutes I am saying <i>where am I?</i> And I’m disoriented. So this morning I had a very strong case of being disoriented and I actually <i>fell</i> and said, <i>where am I?</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And I knew it was just because I got out of bed. I tell these stories so that everyone knows that we’re human because I think so many of us go through the same things. And because we’re doing these calls and because we all have these exalted connections (and they are exalted) with other realms, it does in no way take away the fact that we’re human. I think that one of the reasons that we can keep doing these calls is because we express our humanness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And I was thinking this morning, something I was going to share … Well first of all, let me make an announcement before I forget, okay? I’m going to change our policy about sending out notices for these calls. Because up ‘til now, you know the way the policy got started is when we had a few hundred people checking into our list and getting Message-a-Day and I said <i>I’m going to make a conference call and invite these people to it </i>and that’s how the calls got started and people kept coming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">What’s happened now is that we have a really big list and I’m still sending out the messages to <i>everyone. </i>And what I found is, there’s a small percentage of the list - I can tell how many people open a message with my message sending service - and there’s a small percentage of the list that is open to the messages. That’s opening them all the time. Like for example, we probably have about 10,000 people getting emails and on the announcements for the calls there are probably 300 to 500 that open them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So what’s happening is there are 9,500 people that keep getting an email in their inbox that they never open and they become immune to our emails. I know that I’ve done that with other people when I get a lot of emails from somebody. Unless there’s a subject line that really is provocative, I don’t open it. So what I’m going to do, what I’ve decided is to create a special list for people that want to get the notifications for these calls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Then when I send messages out to the general group, they’ll have a different kind of content. Because understanding how it works, understanding that people respond to the subject line, then I’ll send out emails that have good subject lines and interesting things and I may even send out for example - audios of some of our calls. But I’ll describe what the call is so people are intrigued to listen to it. So watch your emails and if you want to get these messages for the calls then just subscribe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">That’ll be a separate list for announcing calls and I’m sure some people will miss it all and then I’ll start getting emails saying I didn’t get a notice about this call. Well, I’ll just tell them to join the list, the new list, okay? You know running a list is an interesting thing, if you run it masterfully. Because I think most people look at their list and they think I’m just sending one email out to everybody, but there are so many different kinds of people on the list.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Some people, even on these calls - I will do one call and people will say <i>I didn’t get anything out of that</i> and then we’ll do another call and somebody will say <i>I got a huge amount out of that</i> - or, the same call, a huge amount. And that’s because we’re broadband. We put things out so there are really sophisticated people that are paying attention to us. There are really people who, I guess you could call them - they’ve been metaphysical, they’ve been spiritual, they’re very old souls and they respond to some of the deepest stuff that we put out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Then there are people that are not as old souls. Now you know you’re not better or worse for being an old soul or not an old soul. For example, we know that there are lots of angelic beings in this realm who are not old souls but they come from very high places. So, one of the things about being an old soul is that you are more tapped in to the wisdom of this realm. You see things deeply. You’ve been here. You’ve probably suffered [Laughter] many, many lifetimes. If you’re a good old soul, you’ll have compassion for people because you’ll identify with their suffering because at one point in the track you suffered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So, and if you’re not an old soul, it could mean that you’re an angelic soul that decided to come down here and help and often times those beings tend to be really happier in this realm. They’re innocent and you know their job is to be here and not get screwed up. Because usually those innocent souls that come into this realm from higher realms, they don’t have the wisdom to stay out of trouble and they end up getting in trouble and then a hundred/thousand (100,000) years later, they’re the new old souls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Many of us came in [Laughter] and we were innocent like that and then we got in trouble and it’s hard not to get in trouble in this realm. It’s <i>really</i> hard because, you know what do you believe? You know there’s a consensus reality, you come into this realm - you have your parents, you come in and you’re angelic and before you know it you’re starting to get the wrong ideas, the wrong ways of looking at things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Not that they’re wrong, but they’re at a lower level is a better way of describing it. A lower level and [Exhale] as you adopt those things … (we heard that Terry). Was that you?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: That was an out breath Terry, that’s all he’s saying. [Laughter] And it gives me a chance to say that sometimes, it’s not that it’s at a lower level. I think a lot of times people speak simplistically, as if to children, and then when they get caught in it then they say, “W<i>ell, of course that’s not always true.”<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Uhm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Sometimes it means this and they explain and start adding some small print and it’s still not enough. It doesn’t really placate you but it’s sort of … You’re at the beginning of your education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Right. Well you know, part of the reason those angelic souls have come into this realm … and some of you may remember that I had spent a Monday call one night and if you hadn’t heard that call, you should go through the archives and look it up on “<i>Philip Dick.</i>” And Philip Dick was a trashy science fiction writer in the 70s who was writing science fiction articles for - if some of you are old enough - they were saying things like <i>Amazing science fiction stories!</i> They used to sell science fiction like they do tabloids at all the supermarkets and he was writing stories for those tabloids.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And it just happened he lived in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Berkeley</st1:place></st1:city> at the same time I did and he’s one of those people that I’d wished that I had met but I didn’t. But I certainly wouldn’t have appreciated him even if I did because apparently he drank, he wasn’t that together - and but he was keeping this journal and oh, his science fiction stories, after he died, ended up becoming major movies. But he never made the money from it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So he was always financially deprived most of his life but “<i>Blade Runner</i>” was one of them and what’s another one? “Total Recall” with Arnold Schwarzenegger; there are probably about 10 of his stories and they always were stories that were very deep that would trigger thinking. You know, they weren’t just adventure stories. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When I was first having conversations with this voice that said they were the Elohim, I kept doing searches on Google for the word “<i>Elohim</i>” trying to figure out where I could find references. And I found out that Philip Dick was keeping this journal while he was writing his science fiction stories and apparently he was communicating with the Elohim! [Laughter] and but the only time anyone would ever know it was if they read his journal. But he never put his journals out. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But after he died they put his journals out and there was this one amazing story in his journal where he talked about the Elohim and talked about - he called them <i>pluriforms of light</i> from the higher realms would come into this realm and they came into this realm to take bodies and to prevent the dark from totally separating from the light. That if these beings did not come into this realm, there was a high likelihood that this realm would separate out and be totally lost from the light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But when they came into this realm, they would invariably forget whey they came. These were these angelic beings and they would get caught in the negativity of the realm and they would do it for many, many, many lifetimes. And as I see it, as I look at it, I see that they never lost their connection. They were always looking for their connection and they couldn’t find it. And as they were going through all these dark lives, or oppressed lives, or lives of being enslaved by the negativity in this realm, they were actually learning the tools of how this realm works so that at some point they would suddenly have this great <i>ah ha</i> experience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And they would have the map now of how to work in this realm because they weren’t just reading about it, they experienced it. They had gone through it. They understood how it worked. They understood the negativity and they would come out the other end and they could be great teachers, or great inspirers for people. It’s the enactment of this quote from the poet William Blake where he said, “<i>It’s the path of excess that leads to the palace of wisdom.”<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And so, understanding all of that you can look at all the painful things that are in your track and right now, many of us are getting the chance to release those things. To have them come up, and when they come up it can be painful. Really painful, I mean it’s because you have to experience the trauma. You have to experience it. We’ve talked about that a lot but as you do that, and as you release those things, it starts to make you wiser.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It starts to make you more compassionate. You now have the tools to reach out to others that are going through those things and help them. And it takes awhile to get it so don’t be impatient. But that’s part of the process and understanding the process might help you with the patience. Because I know how it feels, I mean a good portion of my life I felt trapped and I probably still feel trapped sometimes. It’s not like it ever goes completely away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: You know, I think that’s something about incarnational lessons. Is that you think you’ve got it learned, you think you’ve got it knocked. Okay, I understand this was my incarnational lesson, boy did I suffer. Thank God it’s over; but the dark night of the soul is over. The new day has dawned. I can relax into enjoying the fact that I understand at a new level. And that lasts for seemingly about 15 minutes. [Laughter]<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Remember, it’s the light that doesn’t rotate, it spirals ever upward. And it spirals around again and you come to that point in your experience where it’s time for a new dose of the incarnational lesson, at a new level. It’s more sophisticated, it’s more subtle. It’s the same lesson but it’s - you have to analyze it to realize,<i> oh my God, it’s the same lesson</i>. As Wynn just said, “Okay maybe I’m still feeling stuck sometimes but not by the same thing.” Well, but feeling stuck was the incarnational lesson or maybe it wasn’t but I mean I’m just using it for an example.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">“Okay, but why am I feeling stuck now? So, oh good, here comes a whole new round of the incarnational lesson! And probably another dark night of the soul - I can’t wait”. </span></i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But you don’t really think that, you really don’t want another dark night. You really want to stay at that place but you can’t. Because the way evolution works is that it goes ever onward. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So while we’re in this realm and while we are operating under such a heavy illusion, we will from time to time hit those incarnational lessons - be plunged into a difficulty of suffering and only awaken from it as we have gained the new wisdom. And this process goes onward and onwards, all of our lives and it doesn’t sound too happy an event. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But actually, it is. It just means that we have a varied existence. Sometimes we’re living in the daylight. Sometimes we’re confused, dazed, disoriented and trying to figure a new level out. But we’re always the same adventurers. We’re always off on the same quest. So it’s just all part of the same rhythm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: You know as you’re on this path and you’re actually in the middle of your unfoldment - usually when you’re coming out of your dark tunnel so-to-speak, where you didn’t even know you were in a dark tunnel, it just felt like that’s the way it is – the first thing that happens is you see the lights, you feel good. You feel joy, you feel connected. You feel loved, whatever - something. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And the first thing that will invariably happen is your ego will immediately come in and say, “<i>Jeez, I’m enlightened</i>.” [Laughter] That will be the thing that automatically takes you back into the tunnel, okay? Because there’s something about when you start patting yourself on the back - and it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pat yourself on the back. There are things you can pat yourself on the back for. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But often times, patting yourself on the back is an attempt to freeze something. Because, one teacher I had that I thought really influenced me when I was younger, said the most important word in spiritual vocabulary is <i>etcetera</i> which is next. And it’s like I’ve learned that, that really got ingrained in me. Say for example when we do these calls and we have these amazing experiences and all these energies come in and I feel it and you feel it, and when the calls over, it’s over. It’s next. What is next?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Don’t be attached to that. Don’t be attached to be thinking, boy I really look good, they all love me or this or that or the other thing, you know, because that’ll all keep you in a lower rate or a lower degree of frozenness. Now you know, one of the things I was going to share, I was thinking, but I’ve never shared this on this call ... You know sometimes we’d play one of my songs but in the context of this -what we’re talking about, and when I go back to the time I was playing music, when I was writing music, I was in that space of being very trapped. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Very much in a cave, very much like feeling inept, misunderstood and that there was something in me and I started putting a pen to the paper and started writing things, and I said, “<i>Hmm, that looks good</i>.” And then when I first did it I was writing lyrics to other peoples melodies and then I would try to write my own melody. Now I didn’t think of it as that I would ever be good at it, I thought of it kind of as a therapy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But I was living in Berkeley and I would play something to someone and suddenly I touched them. And I suddenly got the idea that I had deeper vision of things than most other people and that it was coming out when I was writing lyrics and it encouraged me because for the first time in my life I felt there was something in me that had something to offer people and then I really went into it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Some of you heard the stories of when I was hitchhiking and I had such amazing synchronicities and I couldn’t understand it at the time. I said this must be God. But I was writing songs and I wanted to share with you two songs that I wrote in that period. Because I had tapped into - I couldn’t live it - but I had tapped into the angelic part of me. I don’t know if I want to call it angelic, but the enlightened part of me, the aware part of me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And I was writing songs and I would write them like stream of consciousness. I would start writing the song and I wouldn’t know how it would end, I didn’t have any idea and by the time it ended I said, <i>“How did I write that?” </i>It was too perfect, it was too together and I realized I was tapping into … Now, when I start talking to people, I tap into that same thing because we don’t know where it’s going to go. These are not prepared talks and yet so often, we’ll start on a thread and by the time we’re finished all the threads come together. I’m letting go and trusting and Carla says, “<i>Well I think maybe you’re channeling, Wynn</i>.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But I don’t know if I would call if channeling. But it’s kind of like as you just be neutral and as I’m neutral and start talking, I start accessing things but it’s all happening in of itself. I don’t have the sense of doing it and it comes out and while I’m talking, I know all of you are listening, but I’m not thinking about how I’m looking. I’m just talking and I know that I’m tapping into that place where all our energies come together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And I was doing that in my music. I remember thinking, <i>God I could change the world with this music! </i>And I remember, I wrote a song called - I never played this song before and I never could live-up to this song. The only time I could live up to it when I was hitchhiking and staying in peoples living rooms because I felt I was doing it. But it’s like when I look back at it I was actually connecting with group soul consciousness and trying to put it into words, of my thirty-year-old mind that wanted to help people and feeling all the pain and suffering in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So I thought I’d play that and it kind of like helps you see my track, from back then. Here we go, let’s see. [Song playing]<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I know you’ve been troubled lately and I wondered just what I could do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I wish I had more time that I could spend with you, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now if I had two of me I would send one to your door,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And I’d stay with you and I’d hold you close <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Until you didn’t have those blues any more,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And you could wear my smile inside your heart, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I would shine inside you when your morning starts,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Yes, you could wear my smile and be happy if I only had two of me,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now this world’s been going crazy, you’re not the only one,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But just what can one man do with a world that’s coming undone,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now if I had a million of me, I would pass them all around,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">To everyone that would need a friend, I would turn those frowns upside down,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And you could wear my smile inside your heart,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I would shine inside you when your morning starts,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Yes, you could wear my smile and be happy if I only had a million of me<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But I just have one of me and I know how to sing a song,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So I’ll put my love inside it and now everyone can sing along,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And you can wear my smile inside your heart,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">I will sing inside you when your morning starts,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And if you wear my smile and be happy<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Then I really would have a million of me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Alright, well you can see that on some intuitive level, I understood group souls. [Laughter] But never on a conscious level but I couldn’t live up to that song. That’s why it was hard for me because my conscious self … the only way I knew how to live up to that was to hitchhike and in being just nobody. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Like just kind of somebody that just showed up and then I would be discovered and I would be able to share all this great stuff with people. But as soon as I didn’t do that, it became like I was trying to make a career in music or this or that. Now the interesting thing was - the guy that I ended up affiliating with and who was my greatest support in Los Angeles was Brian Holland. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">He was the guy that wrote all the music for the Supremes and the Four Tops and when I was in high school, I remember listening to this amazing song by the Four Tops and I was probably driving to school or something and the first time I heard it I went out of my body. I had all these energies coming up inside of me and the song was called <i>“Reach Out, I’ll be There.” </i>Do you remember that song, Carla?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Oh, I think so. Sing a little for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Well, I was going to play it but I didn’t get a chance to upload it but I took the lyrics. And later I realized that a lot of things that sounded like love songs actually had another dimension to them. Because they were really God songs expressed as a love song, okay? You know, there’s a kind of love that on a human level, it’s very hard to attain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And yet, when we are moving into that aspect of loving another person, particularly at the initial stages, often times, usually, when you feel that great sense of romance and surrender, you’re seeing God in them. And, you are-loving the way the divine expresses through them and that humans usually are not ready to hold that level of love. But it you’re a songwriter, you’ll capture it and you’ll write it down in that moment and that’s why songs are so powerful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So this was the song, <i>“Reach Out” </i>- this was the lyrics, you remember: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">“I’ll be</span></i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;"> <i>there to love and comfort you. I’ll be there to cherish and care for you.” <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">That was the song and so it’s: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">Reach out, reach out for me, <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">I’ll be there to love and comfort you. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">I’ll be there to cherish and care for you. I’ll be there to always see you through.”</span></i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Don’t we always want somebody like that?<span style="color: #17365d;"> <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">“I’ll be there to love and comfort you. I can tell the way you hang your head, you’re not in love now; now you’re afraid and through the tears “</span></i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">… <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">There I go, I get tears when I read it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #17365d;">“and through the tears you look around but there’s no peace of mind to be found. I know what you’re thinking, you’re alone now, no love of your own but darling reach out. Come on girl, reach out for me; reach out. Just look over your shoulder, I’ll be there to give you all the love you need. I’ll be there - you can always depend on me. I’ll be there to see you through. I’ll be there to comfort you.”<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">That’s the lyrics. Isn’t that amazing?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Um hum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: It’s like … of course that’s a perfect love. And it’s so hard to hold the energy of that kind of love. Because, as soon as you’re energetically involved with someone you usually get caught in the web of your shadow and their shadow and then that is what comes up. But you know what, if you can hold that space of the idea of that song for the people you care about, if you can remind yourself to look through the shadow side of the person, and your own shadow side. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And see, how can you really stay tuned-in to who they really are and this is with everyone in your life; stay tuned-in and not get pulled into the dark side of our-selves. That’s the trick in this realm. Then, as you’re doing that, you have to make sure that there’s gratitude from the other person. Because there are a lot of people, that if you make yourself that vulnerable and caring, they will take advantage of you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">They will rob your bank account, they will use you; they will abandon you because there’s no gratitude. It’s in their consciousness to just be a user. So you can’t give that kind of innocence and total vulnerability to someone who is a user or you’ll end up very hurt, sooner or later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: You know I was saying to Jim the other day, my husband, that the deepest<span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span>verb in our language is probably <i>trust</i>. Because people can say <i>I love you</i>, they can say <i>I’ll be there for you</i>. They can say all these promises but if you can trust somebody then nothing has to be said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Um humm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: It’s all right there. Somehow you know the people or you think that you know the people you can trust. And in a way, becoming older and wiser is a process of becoming able to penetrate the levels of distrust, the levels where people are going to play you and create of you, a victim. So that you’re left at the end saying I should’ve not trusted him; I did and I’m so sorry, I’ll never trust anybody again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And I think that’s the motto of so many of us when we’ve been hurt is I will never let myself get deep enough with anybody to be hurt like this again. I can’t do it, I mean even when your dog dies you know, because animals live so much more quickly than us and you know a dog’s fifteen years is quickly gone and you’re barely - you know, you’ve gone from 12 to 27 in that time but you’ve got a lot of years left, the dog doesn’t. And you lose that dog and you think I can’t do this again. I will never have another dog. But then you get brought in, you know into having another dog because you see a puppy and they’re so cute. So you start falling in love all over again with a new dog. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You’ve got a new dog and you’ve got wonderful years of companionship ahead but there’s always that ending that the dog can’t help because he lives quicker than you do. So I think trust is so, so deep. Such a deep word and in a way it’s deeper than the word love because we’ve used <i>love</i> to mean everything. You know, I love hotdogs, I love Frank Sinatra you know, I love Mariah Carey, whoever we love. And you say the same thing for I love Jesus Christ, I love Buddha, I love the Creator.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You know, you don’t have a word … I remember Woody Allen in - I don’t remember which movie it was, it was a long time ago, maybe 50 years ago, he said (you know, maybe it was Annie Hall) still 50 years ago but I remember the movie. And he said, “<i>I lerv you, I don’t just love you, I lerv you, </i>because you can love anybody but, I lerv you.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now he was trying to create a word that meant love, only more so. What do you do, you know you run out of words, but trust - nothing quite means trust. I trust you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: You know, somebody [who] influenced me used to say - he had a great model to run people by and decide if he trusted them, okay? I’ll share this with you because all of you can try running this by the people in your life and see if they meet the test. It was a really interesting test. He said you know when I’m thinking of really letting someone in to be a friend, I ask myself, “<i>Is that the person I would like to be next to in a foxhole in a war? </i>[Laughter] And if they’re not then …<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: If they don’t have your back then, then they never will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: That’s right. If they’re just thinking of themselves and they’re not thinking of you … So think of those people in your life and see if you’d like to have them next to you in that situation. Of course, we don’t want to emphasize war and all of that stuff, but just the idea that would somebody let you fall? You know a lot of times (you know) friends come when you’re looking good, when you’re doing well, when you’re making money, when you’re feeling in love and it’s easy to have lots of people that want to associate with you. But, as I have learned and some of you have learned - that when all of that goes away and you’re feeling desperate, needy, abandoned, hurt, most of those people are no longer there for you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">In fact, many of us don’t even want to call them up and let them know how difficult the time is for us because we don’t want to risk them shutting us down. We want to live in the memory of how good it was when you were looking good and they were looking good. But I think, in the future, particularly in this world that’s breaking down, we’re going to find ourselves in situations where we really need real friends. Those friends that stand by us and that means also, you stand by them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">This is a very delicate situation because there’s this element of worthiness. In other words, you have to be worthy of a real friend and they have to be worthy of a real friend. Or you have to evolve your relationship so you become worthy and because otherwise you can be a fool and be somebody’s friend … Like you can be there for someone else and they would never be there for you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">In this area of trust one of the things I realized that trust is something that’s developed and earned over time. It’s not something, for me, it’s not something to extend to somebody immediately. And realizing that when you’re in the developing of a relationship with somebody, if you’re giving something, then you’re taking a calculated risk, which is okay. The thing is, is don’t risk more than you can afford to lose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And if you lose it and you say well that was just part of growing, of testing, of seeing if this would work. But if you give more than you can afford to lose, your life can fall apart. And that let the relationship evolve where you know that other person is going … that you can count on them. That they mean what they say. You know one of the things that Carla has said - that Wynn is a really good salesman, which I am. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The thing about a salesman, the negative part, can be a salesman can make something be really good. They can do something and take your money and then they’re gone, you never hear from them again. There’s no feeling about it. And I don’t think I’m like that because I’m still here. [Laughter] But I have the ability to present things in such a manner that they’re attractive and that puts me in a good position to do this job. Because of course we’re dealing with things that are very sacred and also very catalytic and very hard to get through people’s logical brains and I have to find the words all the time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Particularly with strangers or on radio shows, to translate this in such a manner that people are at least curious. What I’ve learned is there’s nothing I can say in my mind that’s going to totally change somebody’s life. But if I can make somebody curious and to reach back, then there’s enough materials in our work and Carla’s work that you really can change your life. Because now you’re accessing all this information that’s out of this realm, that’s from another dimension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It’s higher than your normal consciousness and as you keep accessing it, you learn to go higher than your normal consciousness. I say that only because of so many people that I’ve watched that work for. If you’re listening to this call now and you’re feeling really stuck then you might give it a try (listening to our) you know we have our archives section. And I know there are people doing this. They’ve downloaded the audios; they play them in their car, they play them at work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It’s like a constant inundation of first higher frequencies and then a lot of understanding about what you’re going through that you can integrate, that can let you know that someone out there is aware and cares and you’re not isolated in your experience of what you’re going through. Because I think that’s the worst. I remember when I was younger and I was going through intense things, everyone else seemed together [Laughter] and I seemed untogether. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And, I mean it seemed like, why can’t I be like everyone else? They’re all so happy, they’re married; they have children, they’ve got jobs. Here I am, I don’t know how to make who I am work. It’s like I wished I had found me then, because I would have sped up my process. I would’ve understood myself better and I mean, I hope that for those of you that this is making sense for, it might contribute that to yourself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You know what? I’m going to do … you know a lot of times we keep talking and I’m going to go into the second hour of this and do our healing session and do it really long and really get those energies to come in. It’s so amazing that we’re doing this because it goes back to my song where I said <i>if I had a million of me</i> but I didn’t know it [Laughter] at the time. But I do have a million of me and you have a million of you. We have these invisible guys in other realms that have just been waiting for ions for people to ask for them so that they have the permission to come in and work with us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">That is the most powerful thing we’re offering and if you keep hanging in, sooner or later you’ll probably get it. Carla, before we move on, do you want to say anything?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: No, I think you’re on a roll. Let’s go to the healing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Yeah, before we do that, just before you know Terry always listens and she usually is not bold enough to interrupt like you are but [Laughter] often times, in her quiet way, she has extraordinary observations about things. And Terry, are you there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I’m here, I’m here. Yeah, I feel like even myself, I’ve been getting … like the last I think it was Wednesday call, somebody asked the question about energy. Well, the answer was energy. They were in a situation and things weren’t going well and that kept recycling over and over the same and not coming out of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And they came through and they indicated that the person needed to get the energy of something else to be moved into their space; and when they could grasp a different energy, that this would help them to move out of the old energy and the old things that were going on. I know I think Wynn’s been trying to get that across to me, but I really got it when they came through and they said that. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How important it is to be in the energy of what it is that you would like to achieve</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: I think one of the hardest challenges is that all of us have immersed ourselves in our lives as they are now and we’re in this mirroring effect where everything is reflecting back to us and we’re caught in the web of the reflections. This is a really important concept. You’re placed in this physical Universe, you have a little body on Earth; you have your friends, your family and every one of those people is reflecting you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It creates an energetic lock that keeps you in that matrix of a lower aspect of yourself. And if you’re one of those people that have a higher aspect, it’s not like you have to jettison yourself out. That’s what I did when I was hitchhiking. I jettisoned myself out and that’s how I started to discover everything because nothing was reflecting me at that point. I was just alone on the road and it was just me and the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">But that was me and I had you know a track, I was a troubadour during another life. I don’t recommend that you do that, okay? But hopefully one of the things we’re doing on these calls is creating that anchor point of a higher dimensional connection. And that as you assimilate that it starts to inspire the part of you that’s above your own matrix, the world that’s all reflected back to you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Then, as you hold it, then instead of just reflecting everybody back, you hold your center point and it becomes a more pure innocent energy and the people in your space, some of them, will respond to it. It doesn’t mean you have to explain anything to them. This all happens on a psychic level. They respond to it and they start shifting. The others that don’t shift, that don’t respond to it, you can still engage with them without losing the connection of your highest aspect of yourself and they don’t pull you into it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">At the lower levels of dealing with this, they pull you into it and then you resist and then when you resist, it creates conflict. So the resisting of it doesn’t work and the immersion in it doesn’t work either. It just means that you have work to do on yourself. You know we are one source of that, these calls we do and our materials and our archives, in helping presenting to you a whole other view of reality and not only an intellectual view but the energy of that reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And one thing that’s wonderful about working with Carla and Terry, that in spite of the fact that all of us have our lower natures, we are coming together on these calls, on our Sunday call, and we reflect the very highest back to each other. And then we learn to do that all the time so that no matter when we’re going through lower aspects I can call Carla and she’s my friend or she could call me and I’m her friend and I’m Terry’s friend. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We have that friendship that you know it feels to me fits the criteria that I’d have any of those people in my foxhole [Laughter] with me because I know my back would be watched and hopefully they know their back would be watched. That creates a beautiful relationship. But it’s taken a long time in my life to have those kinds of people that I associate with. You can use that as a model, as a kind of criteria. It doesn’t mean you have to reject everybody, it just means that “put it in the right place in the cabinet,” and don’t think of it as more than it is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Let it be as it is because everything evolves. I mean, I would say Carla and I have known each other for six years now and we didn’t step into that relationship when we first met. There was the potential there. We didn’t step into it and it took quite some time to evolve to where it’s at now where we can be so comfortable with each other. Even in front of all of you, publicly. Allow that aspect to be there, because then it shows a reference point of how things could be for everybody. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">That it is possible to have really good friends. It is possible to trust. It is possible to connect with the higher dimensions and make that an everyday aspect of your life where you know you’re not alone, even if there are no humans to connect with. You can keep connecting to the energies of these group souls who don’t have anything … <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Well, I don’t know - I mean, I’m just mocking it up that probably it’s their greatest pleasure and joy to have people reaching for them because they understand in-depth, the kinds of things we’re going through. They have the ability to connect with you and they are an aspect of you. It’s <i>The Law of One</i> in action. And that, when you make that connection, you don’t have to worry about looking for love in all the wrong places [Laughter] which I certainly have done; which many of us have done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Many of us have gotten really hurt. We had our innocence and we got into a relationship or we got married or we fell in love and then we found out that the person wasn’t who we thought they were. Usually people aren’t who we think they are. So this wonderful thing of having energy friends in other dimensions doesn’t mean you can’t have a love relationship in here, but you’ll be able to have the wisdom to see it for what it is and let it evolve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And seeing if you hold the space of truly unconditional love for that person, if they respond to it or if they just think you’re an idiot and they take advantage of you, okay? Because you can unconditionally love somebody but it doesn’t mean you have to be personally involved with them. When you’re personally involved with someone it’s rather important to have some kind of energetic reciprocal connection at a high level and if you don’t it doesn’t mean you should leave them. If just means that if you’re one of those beings who have come into this realm with that potential, then you need to find something that responds to that in you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Or, you need to find and reinforce this connection with the higher dimensions because they will always be there for you. And that does not mean that you’re not supposed to have a human experience because you are and when you’re having a human experience, it is okay to make mistakes. It is okay to take risks. You know when you’re taking risks then make them calculated risks so you don’t risk more than you can afford to lose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">See if you can develop some people in your life that you would like to have in the foxhole with you that will watch your back and you will watch their back. <b>Now on that note, we are going to go into our little healing session</b>. You notice the energies are already coming in. And so many of you, you are responsible for what we’re doing here. Your ability to respond, to feel the energies have made it so we can be inspired, that we want to keep showing up. You’re part of this creation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">This is like bringing new energies into this realm that weren’t here before and that you’re part of that and you’re helping to anchor that. Many of you are on your way to mastership and to be learning how to hold these energies in your own space and your own domain, in your own dominion, in your own city. So, the human consciousness is flexible. The human consciousness changes all the time. It changes by your thoughts; it changes by your environment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It changes by your projects, the things that you do and it changes by your intent. In the highest truth there’s no limit in your ability to expand, that we can be each other. We can be Earth. We can be the Elohim. We can be the Ra. Not on an ego level, but to be able to hold that expansion in our own human consciousness. In so doing we become a divine expression in this realm and that it’s so important in this period of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because one of the things that is happening is things are breaking down. The things that people were holding onto are falling apart. And when people are losing their hand-holds on the things that were making them secure, that were making them happy, they become more open. That’s when you have the ability to hold the space to help another person because they’re reaching. When people have it all together, when they have lots of money, they have power, they don’t usually reach. In fact they just keep operating within their own little system to increase all of that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So we see the Earth. And we all live on planet Earth</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> and that, we’ve learned that everything in the Universe is alive. Everything has a consciousness and the Earth has a big consciousness and, that there’s an-energy around the Earth and we, as part of our existence, live in the energy of Earth but we take it for granted because it’s always there. So it becomes like a background program. Like living in a very picturesque city, and if you live there, often times usually you won’t have the same reaction to it as a tourist does.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So right now, we want to feel the Earth. We want to feel that connection. I tell people, put their feet flat on the ground so your soles are parallel to the floor and the ground. We can see the Earth. We could imagine that the Earth hears us talking about her and just because we’re talking about her, she gets called to action and we’re going to ask the Earth to send her energy through our floor and into our feet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And move that energy of the Earth through our feet, through our legs, through our calves, through our genitals, through our solar plexus, through our chest, through our neck and into our head and we can feel the Earth’s energy. We’re communing with the Earth. We can send our love and gratitude to the Earth for all that she has endured in connection with holding the space for mankind, who usually often has abused her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The reason the Earth gets abused is because people don’t know the Earth is alive. Whether it is setting off nuclear weapons, whether it is drilling for oil, or just having hateful energy, the Earth feels all that and keeps holding space. So we thank the Earth for her patience. We ask the Earth to be sensitive to those who are having gratitude and for protection for those people, particularly for disasters or things that are balancing that come through the Earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We know that there has to be a certain amount of balancing in this time, energy release which comes as earthquakes and other things. We ask the Earth to mediate on that so that they can happen in a way that doesn’t destroy lots of people, away from population centers and in small doses rather than large to release whatever energies. We now have the Earth like a finger of energy moving through our body, up to our head. And now we’re going to move through our head, through our crown chakra and we’re going to move higher than our body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Start out like a foot above your head and all you have to do is imagine your energy a foot above your head and there it is. We’re not leaving our body. We’re extending our energy. We have an energy that’s occupying our body. That’s who we really are and this energy will follow our intentions. So we’re putting the energy above our head. Now we’re going to move it up to the ceiling. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now we’re going to move it through the ceiling, through the units above you, if you’re not on the top floor and through the roof and into the sky. You can imagine what your roof looks like; you can imagine looking down and there’s your house. Your body’s inside it but your energy is through the roof. Then you keep moving higher. You’re a hundred feet above your roof. You’re two hundred feet above your roof. You’re into the clouds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You can imagine looking down and seeing your neighborhood below you. Now some people actually master the art of seeing while they move their [energy] body and they call that <i>remote viewing</i>. We’re moving higher. We look down and we just see the circumference of the Earth and we go through what’s called the veil. When we go through the veil which is like an energy blockage around our planet, we start to have the ability to move through time as well as space.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Remember, the physical Universe is a construct of time and space. Many spiritual groups talk about something called <i>the eternal now</i> which means that there is no past. Everything was in the now. The past was in the now. There’s a record of the past in the energy fields. But we are in the now and we are learning to stay in the now because everything expands from the now and change and shift because people are in the now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">In the now, everything in the past is present. It’s present in this constructed matrix which we call the Universe. There’s one-energy that the Universe is composed of, we are all the same energy, that Earth is the same energy. As we move up the timelines in the matrix we come to a place where we, who are on this line, converge and we touch each other’s energies. We can right now just say <i>I love you</i> to each other because it’s all of you who are making this possible. I’m not doing it. I’m with you and I’m just putting words to it. We can feel this love and we can invite now, those Sources that are positive and service-to-others that honor <i>The Law of One, </i>to join with us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We create a-huge group energy of the few hundred of us on this line and the multimillions of them, however many they would assign to this project. As we do this many of you are feeling your innocence, you’re feeling your connections. You feel that space in you that is peaceful, silent, above all the dilemmas of your life. Above all those things in your life that are reflecting back to you from lower levels, you’re above them. This is a reference point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The lower levels of reality start out up here and then they precipitate down and we’re going to move back up here shortly and work on precipitating and shifting and seeing where shifts could happen. Well let’s right now take this energy that we have created, this huge pool of energy, and bring it back down through all the levels, back through the veil, back through the sky, back through our roof and back into the top of our head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Keeping in mind that when we left on this journey it was just our own unique energy that was moving up, and now we are connected to a huge energy of millions of souls all, theoretically, (we can’t see this but let’s just take the hypothesis) working together. All creating congruence and bringing this energy back down. Feel it as it enters the top of your head. What we want to do is move this energy through our bodies and keeping in mind that all of us have corrupted energy to some extent or another. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">That means we have points in our energy field that have been stuck for many lifetimes, places where the energy has gone. Like for example, you had trauma and the trauma created a blocked energy somewhere in your body and it continues on and on. So we’re bringing this pure energy in and we want to work on our levels of blockage and see how much we can release and free. So we come in through our heads … <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And I should say those blockages create what we call dis-ease in our body. It’s where we can’t heal ourselves. So we bring that energy through our head and through our eyes and into our brain and around our teeth and any place you feel blockage, just release it. Just release it. It’s kind of like, this energy’s like a huge river and it will pick up and carry things downstream. Just let it go into this energy. Let it disburse down through our neck. If you have some physical problems, focus the energy on that physical problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And down into our chest and, of course, the chest is where your heart is. The heart is one of those places that not only is it the producer of the greatest joy, it also holds the energy of all the hurts we’ve had for all our lifetimes. So let’s move into our heart and let this energy cleanse our heart, cleanse the energy of our heart and release the energies of those miasmas that your heart is holding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And in your conscious mind you can think of the people in your life, this lifetime, which have created distortions in the energy of your heart. The lover that abandoned you for another person, do you still have a grudge inside yourself? Do you still hate them for doing that? Let’s put this energy around all of that and forgive them and let it go. Release it. Do you have someone that stole money from you? Think of them, forgive them and let it go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Do you have somebody that talked about you behind your back and really hurt you and caused other people to judge you? Forgive them and let it go. These are all the things that hold your heart captive in this realm. If you want to graduate this realm, you have to get your heart from being captive. You have to forgive all those people who helped capture it. It doesn’t mean you approve of their actions. It doesn’t mean that you’ll want to be friends with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It means you don’t want to hold any energy in your body that’s negative around anything that was done to you and also anything you’ve done. Chances are you have not been perfect. The chances are you’ve talked about someone behind their back. The chances are you have abandoned someone and forgive yourself for doing that. You know, when you did it you probably didn’t understand karma. You didn’t understand that they were part of you and that by creating pain for them, on some level, it was required for you to create pain for yourself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Right now, let it go. Forgive yourself. Forgive yourself for all the things you’ve done all your lifetimes that you don’t remember. Make a pact, a covenant that if spirit will help you keep these things released you will use the new found energy to be of service in this realm. Let’s just see our heart healthy. Let’s see this energy releasing and molecularly transmuting anything which is keeping our heart in an unhealthy space. And we move to our solar plexus, our stomach area and we know the solar plexus is the seat of personal power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You know there’s an energy that radiates from your solar plexus and that energy in the space around you creates the boundaries. So that people can’t move into your energy field and grab it. Do you know if you’ve ever noticed someone who is a good leader, someone who manages a company or is any kind of leader, if they are a good leader you feel the energy of their power, their solar plexus. Opening your heart, doesn’t mean you discard power. The two work together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">To have leadership you need to have your second chakra activated. It creates respect from other people. If you’re operating just from your heart chakra, often times you’re too vulnerable you take on too many energies. Particularly if you’re trying to lead from that place, you need a-certain energy from your second chakra because that helps organize everything around you. It keeps people from sabotaging you and they will or they’ll try.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We move into our second chakra which is our genitals [creation chakra] and realize that it’s okay to be human. That sexuality is part of our animal nature and that the real challenge is to deal with one’s sexuality responsibly. Because it’s an area that can create so much joy and so much hurt. It’s an area where we connect our energies totally with another human. Who are you connecting with? Once you connect your energies in that way, you are in the karmic soup of that other person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So pick people that don’t have a lot of karma. Pick people that are on a higher path. Pick people that really you have gratitude for in their<span style="color: #0070c0;"> </span>life. Because once you open this up, it’s not that easy to close it down. And if you’re going to be involved with somebody but it’s not going to be a lifelong relationship, then make sure you leave them better than you found them and then you won’t get karma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Because if you move into something with someone and then you leave them and they are hurting, then you become responsible for their hurt. That keeps you bound at this realm. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Then we go to our base of our spine which is called our root chakra - has to do with survival. You know if all your chakras are working and activated together, it works with the survival thing because it attracts things to you, that attracts people to you. It attracts money to you, it attracts jobs to you. Let’s just see that our root chakra is feeling energy and energized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">So we have, each of us, things that we would like to see shift and change in our life. And remember, when you ask for something you have to do the physical things necessary to bring it about. For example, if you’re looking for a job you have to apply for jobs, okay? You can’t just ask. You have to go out and pound the pavement, lift up the phone. And that is part of what stimulates the synchronicity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Let’s take a moment and put in our conscious thinking, those things we’d like to shift in our life. Always for the highest good of all concerned and know that our Sources are hearing you. They’re feeling you and they can help. Of course they are you, it’s you helping you. It’s the higher aspect of you helping the lower aspect. You can put someone you care about into this field and ask for them to be helped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Then we have some people here (healing list) … Kathleen</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> asks for all areas of her life that need healing for her highest good <i>and to be of service to others and receive an abundant income; and to be guided to meet people and work with people for the highest good of all concerned. Thank you, I am grateful.</i> Kathleen must have known what I was talking about today, huh? Then we have …<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Mel in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> … <i>love and light to Roger Walters for his steady progress and return to health, following his being sent home to die a few weeks ago; he was diagnosed with colon and liver cancer 18 months ago and has undergone two series of chemotherapy.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Kathleen again … sending the light to her cats Dennis, Bert, Merlin and Phantom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now we have Jayme in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tennessee</st1:place></st1:state> … <i>emotional torment, physical health and reconciliation with her children.</i> Let’s take a moment and just focus that energy towards Jayme. And then we have …<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Laurie in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place></st1:state> … money, good health; protect our amendments, Bill of Rights and our Constitution. Please have the government for the people, by the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Gijs</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: <st1:time minute="45" hour="11" w:st="on">11:45</st1:time>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Thank you. And I think we better stop going through that even though we gave ourselves a full hour; I think we need a little more time to go through all of the stuff. Let’s get a message from Terry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> to surround and protect Terry, myself, Carla and every person on this line, listening on the Internet, listening anywhere on our planet right now. We invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring <i>The Law of One</i> to join with us. We create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave <i>now</i>. We turn it over to our Sources through Terry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Ra’An/Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: We greet you in the Love Light of <i>The One Infinite Creator</i>. This is Ra’An. This is <st1:date year="2013" day="28" month="7" w:st="on">July 28<sup>th</sup>, 2013</st1:date> and we take a moment. And it is with profound gratitude in our energy hearts that we appreciate the opportunity to be available to each and every one of you that wishes the connection. It is profound for us and sacred that we can have the opportunity to connect and to be available to you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We feel your reaching. We feel your need. We feel your desire to connect, to be a part of all that is to know, that you are important. You are a treasure. You are a part of all that is and it cannot be without you, ever. You are always a part. You are a part of us and we feel that when we offer the opportunity, we let you know we are there and you respond. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It is like a child coming home and it brings tears to our energy eyes that we are welcoming you and you are feeling it and you are-knowing that you are more than your body. You are more than your life in the Earth plane. You have a future and you may, at this time have your contract with your body and your life and you are more than that and we are available to you. And we look at the things on the healing list.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We see the-disconnect (and) between the health tissues. We see the-disconnect between certain things within the family and we send grace with gold energy flecks to get the energy moving from your side, you who have asked, to heal the wounds, to make you whole. And although we are speaking for only a short time, we are there. When we leave, we do not leave. We are still there. Thank you for this opportunity, this profound opportunity. We love you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Thank you and let’s just move right now to that space where we are combining our energies in the very highest dimensions to create healing for our planet. We know that our planet has got a fight of intentions going on for it, that there are competing intentions and that our intentions as a group and, calling in the support of our Sources make a difference. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And that we ask right now for the very highest of connection as we take this group energy and we move it through the dimensions so it surrounds our planet. We see our planet surrounded in this energy and just like we were doing acupressure/<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Acupuncture on the energy fields of our body earlier, we do this for our planet. We realize there’s an energy field around our planet and that everyone on the planet is creating that energy field and putting whatever their energies are in that group energy of the field of the planet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We surround and embrace that energy. We see our Light surrounding and embracing our planet and looking for those points where the energy can be amplified. Where those positive intentions for the highest good of all concerned can be amplified and touched. And that all those people on this planet who are Wanderers, who are Star Seeds, who have come here from higher dimensions can touch this energy and feel the empowerment of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We surround our planet and we look for all those places of earthquake potentials and we send this energy down into the planet, through the Earth, through the ground and we ask for balancing of these energies. So any earthquakes can be moderate and a little small releasing of energy instead of devastations and away from population centers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We see the energy between the Earth and the Sun and we send Love to the Earth Sun connection. We send the energy to all those people that are praying. That however they call on God, that they can make a connection and that their prayers can be heard. We ask for interventions in all those areas where there are destructive elements being artificially created to disable humans, to the chemtrails, the molecular repairing of everything that can be dangerous to a human.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We ask no nuclear weapons go off. We ask that all those in power can open up to their hearts and to compassion. We send the Light to all those brave people who have risked their lives and their careers and their futures by standing up and talking about things. We ask for the awareness of the general population, the vision to get through to see what’s actually at play on this planet. And to see beyond all the consensus realities that are holding them in contraction and in position and in naivety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">We see so many people have good hearts but don’t know what to trust. And we ask for the discernment of people and that the truth-come through, however it needs to come through so people can wake up. On that note, we’re going to count down and come back. If you want to stay in this space and meditate and hold it, that’s a good idea but if you have things to do and you want to get back into being focused in your body, we’ll just do 5, 4, 3, 2, [and] 1.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And just before we end this call, BBS I see is making noise. We’re just about to sign-off, Don. Just to let you know that next Saturday is going to be Session 6 of <i>The Law of One Made Simple</i> series with Carla and that tomorrow night Carla’s going to be a guest and we’re going to look at the connection, if there is a connection we’re going to explore it, with the Ra Group and Jesus and that’s going to be a very interesting session. That’s tomorrow night and on that note, I am going to un-mute you all and we’ll see you next time … okay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Everybody</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">: Thank you, bye-bye. Thank you, I haven’t heard you for awhile but I have a phone … Thank you Wynn, thank you Carla, thank you Terry, thank you Gijs. Thank you everybody for coming on. I send you Love. Love you all …</span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
