<br />“Instant karma is gonna get you, gonna knock you off your feet.<br />&nbsp;Better recognize your brother, everyone you meet.”&nbsp; Sorry for<br />the bad rendition, but we have John Lennon and then we have Boy<br />George singing “Karma Chameleon.”&nbsp; I’m not going to try it!<br />&nbsp;I don’t remember the lyrics to that song; I don’t think<br />they’re as strong as John Lennon’s, but nonetheless, we’re<br />going to learn about karma: what causes karma, what alleviates<br />karma, what’s the difference between “karma” and<br />“processing”?&nbsp; Maybe there’s no difference. <br /><br />Processing is when you go into an environment and you pick up<br />energies from other people, and then you go back to your own<br />environment, and you’re still carrying the energies from other<br />people.&nbsp; That happens all the time to me and to Terry on these<br />calls.&nbsp; Particularly a while ago, when we would come on the<br />calls, after the call was over we’d both conk out!&nbsp; It was<br />because these calls are unusual, because we’re feeling the<br />energies of everyone on the call.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some of you may notice that when we have a lot of new people on<br />the call, the call is sluggish for a while until it picks up. <br />Maybe the whole call will be sluggish, then a week or two later<br />it starts to pick up.&nbsp; Particularly you people who are coming<br />into the calls regularly are helping to anchor the energies of<br />the call; you’re going to start to participate in this process<br />that I am calling “processing.”&nbsp; When new people come on,<br />you’re going to be helping with the processing if you’re<br />really “on the call” and really connecting.&nbsp; In fact,<br />you’re going to be the cause, to a certain degree, for making<br />it possible for new people to come in and for the energy to be<br />handled.&nbsp; I’m sure in your own life you may have experienced<br />this where you’re around someone, and you feel the energies,<br />and you take it on, and then you have to clear it before you’re<br />back to your center again.&nbsp; Particularly if you’re doing really<br />high-energy spiritual creative things, that is one of the things<br />that comes along with the package, the processing.<br />&nbsp;<br />It seems like processing is different from karma in the sense<br />that it’s much shorter: it can be a day; it can be a few hours.<br />&nbsp;It has similarities to karma; maybe it’s more like “Instant<br />Karma,” so to speak, as John Lennon spoke about.&nbsp; Karma usually<br />is long-term, where you’re carrying an ancient pattern.&nbsp; It<br />still has to do with processing, but it’s a pattern that is in<br />your track or in your subconscious, and it’s affecting<br />everything you do to a certain degree. <br /><br />The real question we’re going to look at today is: how do you<br />clear that track?&nbsp; What’s the best way to do it?&nbsp; And, what is<br />the best way to ensure that you don’t create more future karma<br />to be worked out.&nbsp; We are in this life, and there’s something<br />called “experience,” and we all need experience, or most of<br />us need experience.&nbsp; We need friends, we need intimacy; it’s in<br />the way that we have experience that we generate potential karma.<br />&nbsp;How can we have experience without generating karma, and how can<br />we clear the karma that we’ve generated in the past?&nbsp; That’s<br />not a simple task, and everybody thinks, “Okay let me turn the<br />television on and clear the karma.”&nbsp; It’s not going to happen<br />that way; sometimes it takes a long time. <br /><br />I had a conversation with a friend of mine today (Suzanne who<br />does the transcribing for our Wednesday calls); we’ll ask her<br />question tonight.&nbsp; I was going to ask it on Wednesday, but it<br />kind of fits in for tonight’s topic.&nbsp; It had to do with<br />suffering and she was asking about the Christian concept of<br />suffering.&nbsp; Do we really have to suffer to get back to God? <br /><br />My take on this is that when you really choose to face your<br />karma, some of us might have to suffer for a period of time<br />because suffering is the way that things surface and release,<br />depending upon your particular karmic track.&nbsp; Karma sounds like,<br />or we’re describing it like it’s in the past, but in fact<br />it’s all here now.&nbsp; It’s the way your energy track is<br />distorted and got distorted because of the past and past<br />incidents.&nbsp; Now that it’s distorted, how do you<br />“un-distort” it?<br /><br />One concept that I had a realization about was that when you<br />start thinking of karma in your track creating distortions,<br />it’s very easy to think that you were bad in some previous time<br />and that’s why you have karma, that because you were bad,<br />you’re being punished.&nbsp; First of all, karma can be positive as<br />well as negative, because when we’ve done really great things<br />in other lifetimes, we carry those potentials with us.&nbsp; It’s<br />kind of like “which nuts are you going to crack in this<br />lifetime?”&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing about the idea of bad karma that I’ve come to<br />understand is that oftentimes these karmic tracks got established<br />through no doing of your own.&nbsp; You just happened to be in the<br />wrong place at the wrong time; that’s what I think.&nbsp; We’ll<br />ask about that. <br /><br />To give an example, in the Rueckert/Ra material, Carla talks<br />about Maldek, one of the planets in our solar system that<br />exploded and became the asteroid belt.&nbsp; The entire population of<br />Maldek became a tangled knot of souls, mangled and compressed<br />together. According to Terry, often in an explosion souls just<br />“glom” together and they get tangled.&nbsp; Ra describes that they<br />took this tangled mass of souls and brought them in as<br />Neanderthals on earth, and that Ra spent special efforts to<br />untangle them, which took thousands of years.&nbsp; Obviously, those<br />people were all carrying a track of something as a result of that<br />explosion on Maldek, and yet the majority of them had nothing to<br />do with it.&nbsp; I am sure that many of them were wonderful, great<br />and good people.&nbsp; I don’t know about the spiritual aspect of<br />Maldek, but some of them had to have been spiritually oriented. <br />Yet, according to Ra, the whole group got mangled and was a mess.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Karma may not just be a personal thing.&nbsp; You may have walked in<br />the wrong place at the wrong time. <br />Some people would say, “If that happened, it was meant to<br />be.”&nbsp; I’m not sure I believe that; I think that there is such<br />a thing as random events down here that occur, and if you happen<br />to walk into the wrong, random event something could happen that<br />lodges in your karmic field and your energy field that starts to<br />get carried forth from one life to another to another.&nbsp; <br /><br />In both Terry and my cases, we both have knowledge of some<br />previous lifetimes where we were killed in unpleasant ways.&nbsp; I<br />know in my case that one of those lifetimes was a thousand years<br />ago, and I was still carrying that in this lifetime.&nbsp; In<br />Terry’s case, it was a lifetime that she remembers maybe two<br />lifetimes ago, where she was killed in a rather unpleasant way,<br />and she still complains.&nbsp; Are you there, Terry?<br /><br /><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Yeah, it was last life.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; It was last life.&nbsp; Is it okay to share this?<br /><br /><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Terry’s memory is she was killed in an unpleasant way by<br />a jealous woman who knifed her.&nbsp; Oftentimes, Terry will feel pain<br />and compression about the knife wound.&nbsp; I think we could call<br />that “karma”; maybe Terry did something that promoted that to<br />occur, and maybe it was her unconscious that promoted it.&nbsp; Or<br />maybe it was totally the woman’s doing.&nbsp; Regardless, Terry has<br />pain in her chest, and I watched her relive that incident.<br />&nbsp;<br />This is a rather complex topic, and the key is, no matter where<br />something came from, how do we get rid of it?&nbsp; How do we get into<br />present time?&nbsp; How do we move into the present and clear<br />ourselves of these past influences?&nbsp; What’s the best way? <br />That’s going to be our topic.&nbsp; I’m going to open up the<br />conference line before we go to the channeling and have you guys<br />share anything about karma...&nbsp; If there are things about this<br />idea of karma that have ever confused you, just bring it up. <br />We’ll try to cover them in the questions.&nbsp; Does anyone have any<br />burning thing about the idea of karma?<br /><br /><strong>Gijs:&nbsp;</strong> One thing... is there a good karma and a bad karma, so to<br />speak?&nbsp; Is that correct?<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> As soon as you say good and bad karma, you’re involved<br />in duality.&nbsp; If you did something that was really hurtful, then<br />the hurt that you created would somehow lodge as guilt, and the<br />guilt would come up in future situations around the same kind of<br />circumstance.&nbsp; If you don’t like guilt, you would call that<br />“bad karma.”<br /><br /><strong>Gijs:</strong>&nbsp; Is it like when you save somebody’s life; isn’t it<br />just the opposite?<br /><br /><strong>Wynn</strong>:&nbsp; If you save somebody’s life?&nbsp; I have somebody like that<br />in my life now where I knew them in a previous life... and I had<br />done really good things for them in that life.&nbsp; There was all<br />this gratitude, an instant connection, because of that.&nbsp; When you<br />meet somebody that you have a really good positive connection<br />with, it’s usually because they’re a reiteration of the past<br />life. <br /><br />Keep in mind that when we talk about past lives, according to our<br />information, we (may) go back one thousand lifetimes (or more). <br />We all have enormous amounts of connections out there!&nbsp; If you<br />figure in any given life, you probably have touched two or three<br />hundred people, that means that’s two or three hundred thousand<br />people out there that you have some connection with.&nbsp; Any one of<br />them you could meet at any time, and it could trigger some of the<br />episodes of that past life, both “good” karma and “bad”<br />karma, as you call it.&nbsp; I think that if we’re talking about<br />duality, we just say “karma” so that we’re outside of<br />duality without creating a judgment to it. <br /><br />I would venture to say that when you’re in pain because<br />you’re carrying past life incidents, we would call that “bad<br />karma.”&nbsp; Say, in Terry’s case, where somebody killed her,<br />knifed her; perhaps she was innocent. perhaps she wasn’t.&nbsp; You<br />see, it’s complicated.&nbsp; Assuming she was innocent yet still had<br />created a whole track of pain in this lifetime as a result of<br />that incident.&nbsp; What was your question, Gijs?<br /><br /><strong>Gijs</strong>:&nbsp; If there is good karma and bad karma.&nbsp; When they talk<br />about karma, usually it is seen from a negative point of view,<br />karma is something bad.&nbsp; That’s my question, about the good<br />karma.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Even good karma, if it keeps you from being in the here<br />and now, is bad karma.&nbsp; This is a very interesting point.<br /><br /><strong>Gjis:</strong>&nbsp; Maybe we should define karma. What is karma?<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Let’s say, for example, you were born into a very<br />wealthy family because you had really good connections with your<br />parents in another lifetime.&nbsp; So, you were brought into that<br />family and you would normally think that would be good karma,<br />right?&nbsp; Except, suppose because you were brought into a wealthy<br />family you didn’t have to grow, you didn’t have to work, and<br />you didn’t have to work things out with people.&nbsp; You had a life<br />of luxury and indolence.&nbsp; So, what would seem to be good karma<br />could actually not be in your best interests, possibly.&nbsp; We’ll<br />ask the question, they’re listening to us.&nbsp; They’ll figure<br />out how to solve this.&nbsp; Anyone else have a question or comment on<br />karma?<br /><br /><strong>Lisa:</strong>&nbsp; I have a comment; right before I got on the call I picked<br />up a Sylvia Browne book and opened to the chapter talking about<br />karma and dharma.&nbsp; In regard to a bit of information for Gijs in<br />regard to what is “right,” what is good karma or bad karma,<br />I’ll just read a few sentences about what Sylvia Browne says:<br /><br />“What happens to one's karma in crimes of passion or insanity? <br />There is karma attached but it is so minimal.&nbsp; For example, if a<br />mother sees her child attacked and she reacts by shooting the<br />attacker, then there’s no karma.&nbsp; That’s passion.&nbsp; Similarly,<br />if she were insane or driven to that point, very little karma is<br />attached to that.&nbsp; Everything is intention.&nbsp; A pure motive<br />carries no karma. <br />It can be difficult to determine whether harmful intent was there<br />or not.&nbsp; So many times after the deed is done, you start<br />questioning yourself about what your intentions were.&nbsp; Then you<br />build up unnecessary guilt for yourself, instead of just giving<br />it to God.&nbsp; This doesn’t allow you to go out and do anything<br />you want, intention is vitally important.&nbsp; When you really get<br />into the spiritual throes of this theology, you will question<br />intent.&nbsp; How important is it to seek revenge?&nbsp; How important is<br />it to inflict hurt?&nbsp; What are you really accomplishing?&nbsp; Are you<br />doing this for your own ego or are you trying to right<br />something?” <br />Maybe that gives a little insight.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I remember thinking about that years ago, and I thought of<br />the soldier that went to war.&nbsp; He was killing people because he<br />was really into defending his country and proud of his country<br />and so that even if it wasn’t true that the war was an<br />honorable war, he believed it. Maybe he wasn’t going to get<br />karma from it.&nbsp; Whereas if he was killing people and getting off<br />on blood lust, so to speak, then he would get karma for it.&nbsp; It<br />would go into his track.<br />&nbsp;<br />From reading about this and asking questions, I get that when you<br />come into this lifetime, your high self somehow determines the<br />lessons you need to learn to balance the previous stuff.&nbsp; So<br />it’s not completely random—the family you’re brought into<br />and the challenges you have as a youth—because there’s some<br />kind of high-self work there so that you can process things in<br />the best way.&nbsp; The way you’re attracted to people and the way<br />you gravitate towards certain people in your life, even when<br />they’re not good connections, are processes that take place<br />that you need in order to relieve yourself.&nbsp; It’s like personal<br />relationships oftentimes are difficult: a lot of processing takes<br />place.&nbsp; A lot of things come up in personal relationships, love<br />relationships.&nbsp; It’s one of the fastest ways to process your<br />shadow, because of the way it surfaces; it won’t surface that<br />way in other kinds of relationships. <br /><br />Any one else have something about this particular topic?<br /><br /><strong>Isis:</strong>&nbsp; My question may sound silly. I’m trying to take<br />responsibility and live in loving harmony with everything. <br />Sometimes recently I’ve been having a lot of difficulty: when I<br />cut the grass, I ask for forgiveness, and I tell it I'm trimming<br />it and please forgive me.&nbsp; It’s like a haircut that I would<br />give to myself.&nbsp; But I have some other things going on in my<br />house—there’s a mouse in the kitchen.&nbsp; I have a hard time<br />killing a fly and a spider.&nbsp; We have a big farm of ants in our<br />backyard that is always stinging my dogs (we have four dogs).&nbsp; My<br />mom wants to get rid of this farm; however, I don’t want to do<br />it, but I understand it’s becoming a problem.&nbsp; In these types<br />of things, plants and animals, you could say they’re in lower<br />densities.&nbsp; How do you balance it?&nbsp; I want to live in harmony; I<br />don’t want to harm anything; I want to love everything because<br />we’re all one.&nbsp; How do you... balance your well-being, being<br />sanitary and all those things?&nbsp; Do you create karma with those<br />things?&nbsp; Can you just ask for forgiveness and just move forward? <br />It may be a silly question, but I’ve been wondering.<br /><br /><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; There’s nothing silly…<br /><br /><strong>Wynn</strong>:&nbsp; If we go back to what Lisa was reading, it seems like it<br />has to do with intent.&nbsp; If you can honestly feel that animal's<br />invading and doesn’t deserve to be there, maybe it’s okay to<br />kill it.&nbsp; If you can’t, I’ve watched Terry catch spiders and<br />walk outside and throw them back into the garden.&nbsp; So, she has<br />that.<br /><br /><strong>Isis:</strong>&nbsp; Sometimes it’s workable, but other times… for example,<br />we have one mouse that’s just out of control in the kitchen,<br />then it’s “Oh, which one do you choose?” I guess we can<br />always work around it.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I’m sure they’ll make a comment on it.<br /><br /><strong>Isis:</strong>&nbsp; It’s kind of silly, but…<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; It’s not silly if you think about it.&nbsp; It shows a great<br />love and concern for life on your part, which is a beautiful<br />quality.<br /><br /><strong>Isis:</strong>&nbsp; Because we’re all one!<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Don’t think of it as being silly.&nbsp; Terry, do you have<br />anything you want to say from your human side?&nbsp; She can say<br />something if she wants to, but otherwise…<br /><br /><strong>Gina:&nbsp;</strong> It is a beautiful idea to respect all living creatures<br />everywhere.&nbsp; In terms of karma and dharma, I don’t really know<br />the difference between the two.&nbsp; Karma offers some beautiful<br />lessons for us to learn from because we do play out our karmic<br />lessons, I believe, every day of our lives in one aspect or<br />another with all the interactions we have, whether it be over the<br />phone or in person with someone or reading something in a book. <br />I think we’re here to play out those karmic lessons and to<br />learn from every experience.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Karma and dharma, they are both Indian words.&nbsp; I would say<br />karma is the track you carry, the law that says “What you reap<br />is what you sow,” and dharma is the path you walk on from day<br />to day. Your job, your family in present time, is your dharma.&nbsp; I<br />think there’s a connection to dharma and duty; I’m not sure<br />if Terry knows those distinctions, so I don’t know if I want to<br />ask them.<br /><br /><strong>Lisa:</strong>&nbsp; Can I say something?&nbsp; Sylvia Browne says dharma is only<br />another word for “responsibilities.”<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So, it’s the path you walk on?&nbsp; Similar? <br /><br />David Wilcock just came out with a book with a big New York<br />publisher: The Source Field Investigations. It's the same<br />publisher that publishes Sylvia Browne.&nbsp; David is probably on his<br />way to, I hope, great notoriety. I don’t believe he talks about<br />channeling in it; it’s made for the public to bring the public<br />into this whole idea of the shift.&nbsp; His publisher is talking<br />about getting him on some major talk shows.&nbsp; He wrote it to not<br />be more far out than would make him publicly accessible.&nbsp; Terry,<br />are you ready?<br /><br /><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the light to<br />surround and protect each person here and that any negativity be<br />taken to the higher realms of light and transmuted for the<br />highest good of all concerned.&nbsp; We see ourselves in the flow of<br />energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the<br />galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the energy fields of the<br />planets, through the outer energy fields of Earth, through our<br />bodies and into the center of the Earth.&nbsp; Right now, we invoke a<br />group energy connection amongst all of us present while<br />maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls.&nbsp; And, we invite<br />those sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring The<br />Law of One, to join with us and we create a protected space that<br />only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature<br />must leave now.&nbsp; We open ourselves up to the source that<br />identifies itself as Ra’an, a conglomeration of two group<br />souls, for our questions tonight.<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:&nbsp;</strong> We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite<br />Creator.&nbsp; This is September 5th, 2011, planet Earth, and we greet<br />each and every one, wherever you are and whenever you listen or<br />read a transcript.&nbsp; It is our honor; we are honored by the<br />connection and we send love light to each and every person.&nbsp; We<br />are familiar with the questions you have put forth.<br />We see dharma as the person’s path in bringing forth the<br />conduct that will create a life of joy and a connection with the<br />higher realm.&nbsp; We see karma as a terrific tool for providing<br />growth for an individual in his path, in his way through, and in<br />his successful successive lives.&nbsp; Karma provides a tag, a tab, a<br />sign that there is something there to learn, that there is<br />something that is not completely satisfactory.&nbsp; If it is in the<br />case of “good karma,” there is a feeling of joy and success<br />in connection, as when spirit is present, connection provides the<br />higher path, the better path, when the connection is in harmony<br />and in love.&nbsp; Do you have questions?<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Some of the questions people asked... I’m going to put<br />forth the question Suzanne asked me on the phone today: “How is<br />suffering connected with karma?&nbsp; What’s the benefit of<br />suffering, and why is suffering connected to Christianity in such<br />a strong way?”<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an</strong>:&nbsp; There are several questions. <br /><br />In the third dimension, where one is connected with factors that<br />are of the physical realm, suffering can be taken on from the<br />connection with the body, as the connection with disruption in<br />energy flow within a body.&nbsp; When an individual, if it is not<br />karma-connected, leaves a body, they leave such suffering behind.<br />&nbsp;There are many kinds of suffering, but there is one thing in<br />common between the different kinds of suffering.&nbsp; In all<br />suffering, there is a disconnection, a separation, and then there<br />is created pain…<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; We’re talking about suffering, there’s pain; but with<br />pain in the body there is a disconnection when you die…<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:&nbsp;</strong> When there is a disconnection, for instance, when an<br />individual has a cut there is a disconnection between the<br />different tissues; there is a separation.&nbsp; The impulses to stay<br />connected back-up upon the tissue, and this lack of flow of<br />electricity creates a back-up which then jams the tissues, and<br />this back-up creates pain.&nbsp; So, too, when an individual in a<br />relationship has a disconnection plugging up the communication<br />and cutting off something that once flowed. The energy backs up<br />upon the person, and there is no outlet, and this creates pain.&nbsp; <br /><br />If the individual is released in a body death from the body, and<br />then does not experience the body trying to reestablish energy<br />flow, then the release can be very beautiful.&nbsp; So, suffering<br />involves disconnection.&nbsp; If a person has karma from a past life,<br />there may have been disconnection, and the individual is trying<br />to reestablish some kind of a flow, some kind of a reconnection<br />with a person or thing, or an occupation.&nbsp; And, when they can<br />reestablish flow, then pain will subside. <br />Does this shed some light on some aspect of it for you?<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Does the person have to reestablish flow with the<br />same entity, or are there other entities that can substitute<br />where they can complete that energy?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:</strong>&nbsp; It does not have to be with the same entity; it can be<br />within the general subject or topic wherein the original flow was<br />disrupted.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Can the person work this out on the inner levels, in other<br />words clear that need for the flow?&nbsp; Or, do they need to find<br />somebody to work it out with?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:&nbsp;</strong> If they could within their mind recapture the original<br />circumstances and then release it within their mind, the other<br />person does not have to be present.&nbsp; Once freed in their own<br />field, their own matrix, they reestablish the ability to<br />reconnect; then if it is psychological pain, it will release. If<br />it is some aspect of the body that has been injured, then it can<br />readjust after the body is left and the karma, the disruption in<br />energy, does not have to carry over to the next life.&nbsp; Many<br />times, a wound in one life will create a suffering in that there<br />is a withdrawal of energy from that area.&nbsp; The person finds it<br />painful to connect with the disruption in that area, and<br />withdraws energy; therefore in the next life they continue to<br />withdraw energy and there may be a birthmark or some mark in that<br />area, or a drooping eyelid, or some sign of the past karma.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; If Terry’s high self gives permission, could<br />you share how she could release the knife wound that she<br />remembers from her past life?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:&nbsp;</strong> There is a misalignment in the area of the knife wound<br />in the back; there is a misalignment within the muscular<br />structure, and this would need to realign.&nbsp; It has conformed to<br />the cutting of the tissue in the past life, and the energy was<br />withdrawn from that area and so it was not able to reconstruct<br />fully in this life. To put some attention every day upon it, and<br />to picture it healed, and picture the alignment in order, will<br />help to some degree.&nbsp; Then the area can begin to flow the energy<br />in a normal pattern, which then will reestablish energy flow to<br />the area.&nbsp; Heat is one sign that healing is occurring.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Would there be outward modalities, say like acupuncture,<br />massage or energy work, that could help speed the process?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:</strong>&nbsp; Energy work could help, or using the massage machine;<br />if you set up the massage machine to run it over the spine, not<br />even for a long time but just for a few minutes every day will<br />help tremendously.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; A question that comes up—I’m using Terry<br />as an example but I would assume that many people have these<br />kinds of ruptures in their systems that are creating pain in<br />their bodies with carryovers from past life incidents.&nbsp; Could<br />Grace be invoked to speed this process up?&nbsp; If so, how?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:</strong>&nbsp; One could ask for Grace to work with healing in the<br />area, or one could ask for healing in the area and the energy, a<br />force that had the most ability to heal, to work with that area<br />in the name of the Christ consciousness, so that one does not get<br />a negative source.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Some people have done what perhaps we would<br />call really inflictive, negative things on other people in past<br />lifetimes.&nbsp; It is my understanding if that was the case that they<br />would have a lot of guilt this lifetime.&nbsp; The guilt could create<br />immense suffering but it’s not obvious where it’s all coming<br />from.&nbsp; Could you explain a little about that process and how, if<br />one is in that particular dilemma, the best way that they could<br />clear it?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; If one has committed an atrocity, say, in a<br />certain lifetime and as that atrocity has certain frequencies,<br />certain motives involved with it, then in this lifetime those<br />frequencies or those motives may appear as frequencies or motives<br />in the matrix of the individual.&nbsp; As such, they then attract<br />those frequencies to themselves and it can be in some other of<br />the flows. <br /><br />For instance, one could feel the motivation to do a similar thing<br />to one’s own self—that would be self-to-self.&nbsp; Then also, one<br />might, since they were sitting in that frequency, feel what they<br />had done to another.&nbsp; And, since they were in that frequency,<br />they may wish another to do it to themselves, or feel that<br />impulse to pay themselves back.&nbsp; Or, they may be curious and then<br />see others do it to others.&nbsp; They may have an interest to try to<br />understand why they had those ideas that may go through their<br />head without understanding where they came from.&nbsp; Then, they may<br />wish to watch movies and to see similar things happen in movies<br />that they hope can give them (some) relief from these thoughts or<br />these subconscious impulses, or the subconscious and (apparently)<br />unfounded intentions that seem to be with them, and they may use<br />movies to attempt to release these feelings.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Does that work?&nbsp; Can that work, watching movies that<br />trigger those things?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:</strong>&nbsp; They may make the pattern worse, and they may trigger<br />it more as the original incident comes more and more to focus: it<br />applies more force in their psyche, and it may become worse<br />before it gets better, before it releases, and they may not<br />understand what is happening.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> If a person has an incident like that, and they just<br />don’t feel well all the time, can they process it just by<br />letting their feelings come up and pass through them?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:</strong>&nbsp; This is a very good way to work with oneself, as the<br />feelings will pass; even though it seems like they may never<br />pass, they will pass.&nbsp; It may take as many as three days for them<br />to pass, but the idea is to not act upon them, to simply let them<br />pass, to observe them.&nbsp; At some point, a person may start to see<br />a reconstruction within their mind of the original thing that<br />happened.&nbsp; Even though it is hard to look at, if they can simply<br />observe it and let it go by, then each time that happens it<br />releases a little bit of it, and life events, so to speak, can<br />run the original incident out.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you. Two other things I’d like to ask about in<br />terms of releasing heavy patterns from the past: one of them is<br />good works.&nbsp; I’ve heard people say that if you do good works<br />and make real contribution to the lives of others, it speeds up<br />the process of releasing the guilt from the past; it kind of<br />balances it.&nbsp; Could you share the effectiveness of that approach?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you. This may not work to release the original<br />karma; however, it may help the individual in building up his<br />idea of himself, his self-concept, his self-worth and his feeling<br />of trustworthiness, so that he can trust himself to be a helpful,<br />worthwhile, contributing individual. This can help to give him<br />strength to handle and just simply observe and let pass through<br />any karma.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> How about the idea of forgiveness?&nbsp; If a person can have<br />some idea of what they’ve done, or even if they don’t know<br />exactly what it is, if they are experiencing the effects of<br />overwhelming guilt—sometimes guilt comes up like being<br />apologetic for yourself, feeling&nbsp; worthless...&nbsp; If they are<br />feeling those things, is there a way to apply self-forgiveness to<br />release those energies faster?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an</strong>:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Forgiveness of self is very important, and one<br />should distinguish between implanted thoughts of being worthless<br />and thoughts that are their own.&nbsp; If their mind is simply<br />relaying thoughts that have been laid into them in the<br />past—say, in growing up, a parent has been very hard on the<br />child and looked at the child as if the child is worthless and<br />will never amount to anything—[then they could] isolate the<br />source of that and in that case forgive the parent, forgive the<br />person that implanted the implant, not to buy into the idea that<br />has been laid in, but to just simply forgive whatever sources<br />laid that concept in.&nbsp; Then to see one’s own person and forgive<br />anything that they have done in the past that they do not feel<br />right about. Then they can move forward in their life, having<br />completed their thoughts about that and learn from that, so that<br />in the future they will act differently.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn</strong>:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Finally, the idea of processing. To me, there<br />is some kind of connection between processing and karma, although<br />processing seems to be a fairly positive process which allows one<br />to help others.&nbsp; Obviously everyone has got to do it themselves. <br />For example, there are times when we do a call and the energies<br />all become one on the call, and when the call is over we’re<br />really tired.&nbsp; I don’t know if in the other realms this is<br />experienced, of any lingering energy after a call or if it’s<br />totally clear.&nbsp; Is that processing of the energies on the call in<br />the way that I see it, is that true?&nbsp; I use the call, but I<br />imagine that everyone moves in and out of circumstances during<br />the day, and they’re picking up energies from everything<br />they’re in.&nbsp; Some of the energies pass through and some of them<br />stick and then they have to release themselves from those<br />energies that stick.&nbsp; Could you share a little bit from your<br />perspective about that process?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; When a person has total acceptance and no<br />judgment and total love, then things do not stick.&nbsp; When a person<br />has judgment and concern, then things stick.&nbsp; If a person is free<br />to flow in and out of a situation without attempting to change it<br />but can simply let it flow through them and look at the<br />circumstances of it with love... Another factor is that when an<br />individual has charge or concerns in an area, and they are<br />touched upon by another, and one picks up that concern from the<br />other and has similar propensity towards concern, then they can<br />be affected to continue to try to work it out after the call is<br />over.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I’ll just ask one more question, and then<br />we’ll close this session.&nbsp; I thought we’d address Isis’s<br />question about the feelings she feels when there's animals,<br />there’s bugs, there’s mice; is there karma that comes from<br />killing those kinds of creatures?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:</strong>&nbsp; It depends upon the intention of the individual, and<br />there are circumstances where there is such a conflict between<br />the invading population and the individual that it is necessary<br />to set the boundaries and to clear them out. <br /><br />There are two ways: one of them is harder, because they do not<br />(the insects, ant or mouse population) get the message. They are<br />in a war, so to speak, for resources, and this creates a problem.<br />If one looks at it from the other side, one can set their mindset<br />to a loving solution, an asking of forgiveness from that<br />population and an intention that they move their hive, or their<br />home, to another location. <br /><br />In some circumstances it may be necessary to enforce it, and when<br />it is totally invasive, or somewhat invasive, just to set the<br />boundaries.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Anything more you’d like to share with us<br />before we close for the evening?<br /><br /><strong>Ra’an:</strong>&nbsp; We have an outpouring of love for each of you and for<br />the circumstances that you have undertaken.&nbsp; We know there is<br />suffering involved; from the perspective of the other side, there<br />is home where the suffering is alleviated.&nbsp; We leave but we do<br />not leave.&nbsp; Adonai.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I’ll make a formal announcement, but this<br />Sunday on the grid healing, if we can pull it off, we’re going<br />to do some little sub-discussion groups after the grid healing on<br />different topics and different people will lead them.&nbsp; Suzanne<br />Hayes might lead a discussion group on the Law of One, or<br />somebody else might have a healing circle.&nbsp; I’ll see the people<br />who come forward that have something to offer.&nbsp; It’s more of a<br />discussion, just people getting to know each other.&nbsp; We have<br />people that are listening to these calls, but we don’t know who<br />they are; they never get a chance to express themselves. We want<br />to create an environment where people can meet each other and<br />harmonize, and we’ll figure out all the topics.&nbsp; Pay attention,<br />because for some of you this may be a really valuable thing to<br />partake of.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />On that note, we’ll say goodnight to everybody.&nbsp; Happy Labor<br />Day.&nbsp; Thank all of you who are on the line and who are listening<br />that are supporting the energy of this work.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
