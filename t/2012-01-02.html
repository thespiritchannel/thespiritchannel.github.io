<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span>&nbsp; </span>I’m here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hello.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span>&nbsp; </span>This is an exercise in inter-dimensional connection; this is a fairly unusual thing we’re doing on these calls.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anyone who is listening for the first time should ramp up and prove it to themselves, because we don’t make any claims that we’re doing anything.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Except during the course of these calls, aside from whatever I say, we have communications with voices coming through Terry – intelligence coming through Terry – that explain themselves to be a group soul consciousness.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re like me, when I heard the idea “group soul consciousness”, I would say, “What does that mean?”<span>&nbsp; </span>This has been going on for a number of years, and I’ve kind of got a little clue, a little more clue than I did way back when - about what that means.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">According to our communications, we who are embodied on earth are kind of in a prison, some of us.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re in a state of contraction, but we don’t realize it because it’s ordinary.<span>&nbsp; </span>We live our lives in states of unawareness and we’ve created our reality, our idea of reality, from various aspects of what could be called “consensus reality” – from the news – from the way we were brought up; by the standards of society, by the people who are famous who become our heroes.<span>&nbsp; </span>To some degree or another, it’s all programmed; it’s programmed sometimes by intent, sometimes by happenstance.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, the reality system that is presented to us in this realm is defective; it’s incomplete.<span>&nbsp; </span>It works at the level that it works on, but there are great areas where it doesn’t work; where it stops.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One of the worst aspects of the reality that’s presented to us in this realm is that we feel separated from each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>We feel oftentimes alone and isolated.<span>&nbsp; </span>We participate in the illusion that who we are is what we have; what we have in material goods, what we have in terms of family, what we have in terms of reputation, what we have in terms of worldly power.<span>&nbsp; </span>If we don’t have bunches of those things, we tend to feel worthless and inadequate and that we are meant to have them.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can go through your whole lifetime and feel that way.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you die apparently that idea that you were meant to have all these things travels with you and so you come back into this realm for another shot and maybe, you’ll get it better.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you do happen to get it better and you start getting some of those things that you didn’t get in the past life, since you’re not running the awareness that we’re all part of each other then you get arrogant and you think you’re superior to other people and live your life feeling that way and when you die, you come back again.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I don’t understand how this part works although I’ve read it enough times – there is a part of you that’s higher than this realm, sometimes referred to as your High Self.<span>&nbsp; </span>On some level, your High Self programs/interfaces with events that transpire for you.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s, to some extent, programming your life so that you have the experiences for maximum growth while you go through a lifetime.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your High Self is attempting to give you the experiences so that you can have an awareness of the fact, the conscious awareness, that we’re part of each other, and there’s one energy that runs through everything.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">For some people their High Selves are part of the Ra group – that’s been said – and that [person is] part of the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their High Self is part of the Ra group, so it’s directing their life as part of the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe other people have other High Selves.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s a good thing we’re going to ask questions about that tonight to see how that works.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We announced that we were going to talk about the difference between the Elohim group and the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can share my personal experiences there in the sense that I think I can identify the frequencies of both groups when they’re present.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the Ra group, the individual Ra group entities are more localized.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sometime ago when Terry and I were in the Los Angeles area and we had a little room in somebody’s house and we were actually doing the sessions that created the Creator God book in that room.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the time that we created that book, no one was paying attention to us and when we talked about it people thought that we were nuts.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was half-way thinking we were nuts, but I said, “Just in case they are who they say they are, let me ask questions of a Universal Concern and see how they answer” and that’s how that book got started; when we asked all those questions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">If you don’t have that book, you can get it for free at creatorgodbook.com, and it’s chock full of conversations with the Elohim group.<span>&nbsp; </span>At that time, we had communicated with the Ra group, but never were the two communicating with us together.<span>&nbsp; </span>We communicated with the Ra group; occasionally they would come through and say, “I am Ra.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t think I ever asked for them in particular, but they would show up for particular kinds of questions and issues.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">[One day] we were having [a] conversation with the Elohim group.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had read that one of the ways inter-dimensional sources manifest in this realm was through orbs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have you guys seen pictures of orbs?<span>&nbsp; </span>You can’t often see them with your naked eye as far as I know, or most people can’t.<span>&nbsp; </span>They show up in digital camera pictures that look like circles, spheres, floating around things.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is one picture of me where there is this blue sphere on my elbow which I put out.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was talking to the Elohim and I said, “Can you guys project an orb into this room so I can see it?”<span>&nbsp; </span>The answer was really quite amazing:<span>&nbsp; </span>(what) they said there already was an orb in the room, except it went up into the sky and down into the earth, it was so big that we couldn’t see it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I started to then feel the energy and I said, “I think I can feel that.”<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As you know, when we do our grid healings on Sunday, we do an exercise where we project ourselves into that field and many people can feel a great sense of expansion.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">They said the Ra group would project themselves into smaller spheres and the Elohim group would be a huge sphere that was so big you couldn’t see the edges of it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I started to get the beginnings of the understanding of how these two groups work.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There were a number of questions that I’ve asked.<span>&nbsp; </span>I asked the Elohim when I was first talking to them through Daphne, I said, “How do you work with this realm?”<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve got the book here, I (will read it.) </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">“Meet the Elohim”:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">“Who are the Elohim and why are they connected with the evolution of the human race?” <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Elohim answer:<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>“We are a soul group whose purpose is to bring life and life forms to planets such as earth.<span>&nbsp; </span>We then work with the life forms in the hope that they will align themselves with higher inter-dimensional energies, bringing heaven into the third dimension, transmuting third dimensional experiences into a fruitful playing ground for learning the lessons of love and bringing wiser entities back into the fourth and fifth dimensions.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is through Terry.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I asked the question, “Why doesn’t the origination of life start out in a higher dimension instead of going through a dimension which is so difficult and challenging?”<span>&nbsp; </span>They said, “Life starts out beyond the dimensions; dimensions are a limiting factor, a focusing mechanism for life.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each dimension has its own lessons.<span>&nbsp; </span>The third dimension is a lesson in limitation against odds to temper and strengthen the soul.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I remember reading those answers and I said, “If they’re a fake, they’re pretty good because they’re answering right to the question with a sense of confidence that they understand all of this.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Those of you, who are listening on the calls regularly, know that we have expanded on all of these things many times with further questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re going to do that tonight.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In another chapter I said, “How can one really know one is having a connection with an inter-dimensional source as with the Elohim?<span>&nbsp; </span>What are the physical signals and evidence that would confirm that one is having a connection?”<span>&nbsp; </span>“There can be a light appearing to you, surrounding and providing a loving space around you.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a love light surrounding you that you can sense.<span>&nbsp; </span>That is one of the first signs of connection.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you were directed to the light an answer may form in your mind as if a thought.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must use discernment in accepting an answer.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As we’ve learned: all this stuff in channeling is very tricky because once you start trying to get messages from other realms, once you choose to want to do that (which people are tempted to do when they hear this kind of stuff that we’re doing) it’s very easy to get a negative source.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s very tricky figuring out that they’re a negative source.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">If an answer is given - if an answer does not fit your question or fit your sense of what is right - you may have been contacted by a negative source that has intercepted the connection line.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do not ever pursue this; reset and connect to the Elohim source or to the Ra source. <span>&nbsp;</span>The thought will have a resonance within you of correctness.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do not accept an answer unless it resonates as a correct and informative answer.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I’ll tell you an interesting story of something that happened to me about a month ago, I live in Sedona and Sedona is filled with people that do readings.<span>&nbsp; </span>I happened to wander into this craft show and somebody pulled me over and said, “Do you want to get a reading?<span>&nbsp; </span>Get a reading. Get a reading.”<span>&nbsp; </span>”<span>&nbsp; </span>I usually will say “No”, but I said, “Yes.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I went in and I sat down.<span>&nbsp; </span>These people said they were able to bring forth my guides and that I could get messages from them, so would I like to ask to questions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I called in a lot of protection to myself and I asked a question and it seemed like a really wise answer and then I asked another question and it seemed like a wise answer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I talked about myself and they were very intrigued with my whole story, and there was a potential to get together and work to do something together.<span>&nbsp; </span>I let it sit with myself; and then I actually did a session with Terry and I asked a question about it because I wanted to get our sources take on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>What they said was, that those people were very nice people and that they were giving people their information from their guides, so to speak.<span>&nbsp; </span>A lot of people talk about guides and contacting your guides and that we all have guides.<span>&nbsp; </span>What they said next, through Terry, was that in my case, because my guides are connected with the Ra group that was who was giving the information through those people.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not everybody has guides that are positive, so they would give people information based on their guides.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s tricky, because if you have a positive outlook and you have a positive self-image for yourself [you get positive information], but if you’re connected to dark energies or compromised energies, or past life connections of negative things – you can easily have “guides” that are not of the positive; they could easily trick you.<span>&nbsp; </span>You learn to depend on them, and they’re not necessarily in the highest good of your soul evolution.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When you’re getting messages from other realms, you must use the utmost of discernment and it’s one of the reasons why I tell people don’t believe what we say on these calls.<span>&nbsp; </span>Check it out for yourself.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was very nervous about doing something like this publicly with Terry for a long, long time, because we can’t take anything back that we do in a public way.<span>&nbsp; </span>If we give misdirection, it’s out there – it’s done.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was only after very careful testing of doing a little bit; trying something and feeling how it felt.<span>&nbsp; </span>Terry was very shy and it’s like how could we do this publicly and be sure that it was positive and that it never lost its positive aspect.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As we’ve learned about these two group souls – the Elohim group and the Ra group– they’re as real as you and I.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just because they’re invisible, just because we can’t see them, just because they’re energy – they’re real.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re not ‘woo woo’, they’re real.<span>&nbsp; </span>They both function differently.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re going to ask questions about this, but it seems to me that the Ra group works much closer with this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, according to the Wilcock/Rueckert channelings, we’re having this division of souls right now that’s taking place over the next so many years – they say it’s up until 2017 – and chances are (we’ll ask if this is still the case) that if people haven’t gone to one side or the other, at that point it’s a done deal.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">What does that mean – one side or the other?<span>&nbsp; </span>This is something you can’t do with your conscious mind. <span>&nbsp;</span>You can’t say, “I want to graduate this realm, I want to keep an open heart.”<span>&nbsp; </span>It means you need to keep your heart open slightly more than half so that you fit, your energy field fits, in this upgraded earth.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it doesn’t fit, in other words you don’t meet that criterion, you start repeating this density on another planet in another star system.<span>&nbsp; </span>Supposedly, it’s the Ra group that moves your souls from one planet to another.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I asked the question, I said, “How does this work?”<span>&nbsp; </span>They said “It’s like just moving a bunch of cut-out paper dolls from earth, starting somewhere else.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, they said, “millions of years, possibly, of evolution somewhere else.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe it’s less than that.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not like you move into a third density planet that is already functioning and working; it’s like perhaps people are coming in starting as apes or starting as a more primordial form of life and that life has to evolve until the full soul energy can inhabit a being and work out their destiny in a new time and place.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m not sure of that, but since there’s no time in reality it doesn’t matter.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I say millions of years, it seems like a long time.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a long time if you’re lying in a bed with a broken leg because it hurts.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, the way it works – as we all know since we’re a product of this realm – every lifetime we don’t even remember.<span>&nbsp; </span>We come in and it’s like we don’t know that we’re carrying a soul stream.<span>&nbsp; </span>We don’t know that we’re reincarnating.<span>&nbsp; </span>We discover ourselves in this realm and we have to create and figure out a way to make the best of it.<span>&nbsp; </span>The best case scenario is that you get some soul growth while you’re here, that you get more expansive.<span>&nbsp; </span>The very best scenario is that you graduate.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When you think of the word ‘graduation’ you think it’s an honor; it’s like you want to be at the top of hierarchy and you want to graduate.<span>&nbsp; </span>The truth of the matter is, are you ready to give up your attachment to life in this realm, because if you’re not, you’ve got to continue.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Of course, it’s more complicated because there’s a division of souls, if you give up your attachment to life in this realm the indication is that you will have life in the next realm – in the fourth density.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is all guided by these soul groups, in particular the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>Oftentimes, we don’t give the Ra group as much talk space or air time as the Elohim group, although they’re both there.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those of you who have listened to these calls know that there have been some miraculous calls here where part of the Ra group did come in, talked about their time in </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Egypt</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Ra group has involved itself in a very close way with this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’ve been involved; they’ve taken bodies here, they’ve worked with people; our information is the Ra group was very much connected with Jesus.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Elohim may have worked with that, but I think it was the Ra group’s creation.<span>&nbsp; </span>They actually made plans over thousands of years for things to manifest.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As I said in the email today, this is a very unusual thing we’re doing in integrating and learning about both group souls, not as something scholarly, but being able to talk to them directly right here on the call.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Recently, I wrote something and my friend Judith who has been coming in on these calls helped edit it; she’s a really good editor, really smart.<span>&nbsp; </span>We came up with something really good, and it’s a little five-page pdf with links to the things that we’re doing – things in messageaday, thewynnchannel, the free books – everything.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was designed to be an introduction, and if any of you want to download it, share it with anyone, I’d like to see how it works, and you can get it at wynnintro.messageaday.net.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s part of my constant effort to say, “How can we get this to reach more people?” Knowing there a lot of people that would change their lives if they found it, but how do they find it?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does somebody find something like this?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span>&nbsp; </span>It was really interesting when we were living in that room in [La </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Canada</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">]. We would be talking to the Elohim and then you were saying things about the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, the Ra group came in and we were talking to them, then the Elohim group came in and said they needed to come in to straighten up some of the things that you were saying or asking and that the other group (the Ra group) had misconceptions about the Elohim group.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, it ended up they (both), outside of our influence, got together and made a collaboration to work with us.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span>&nbsp; </span>There is this representation, seeming representation, from the Elohim group.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ll tell you one thing that we picked up at that time:<span>&nbsp; </span>The Elohim group, by and large, didn’t have bodies and stayed as pure energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>They said somebody had to hold the space in the center or if they didn’t do that, the whole thing could fly off the handle.<span>&nbsp; </span>They said that they look at us as a composite of geometrical frequencies, and that a human is a conglomerate of energies based on sacred geometry and they can see all the energies that form us down the track.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m trying to express this in as accurate terms as possible; in terms that [are clear]– but it’s not easy to explain it.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There was a certain seeming detachment from the Elohim, like they would say from their point of view does it matter if somebody graduates now or if they graduate 10,000 years from now.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s no time - so it doesn’t make any difference.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On the other hand, there was the idea from the Ra group’s point of view - since they had bodies, since they had graduated from this realm, they understood the pain of this realm from personal experience, which the Elohim didn’t experience quite as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, the Elohim group can project into this realm and they can feel someone in this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can feel pain I’m sure, because if they go look at you, they’re feeling your pain, they’re connecting with it and they feel it - but then, it releases.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not the same as having a bad life where you can’t get out of it, and you’re stuck.<span>&nbsp; </span>The people around you are suffering and you’re feeling unloved and you’re isolated and you’re alone and you’re going crazy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then you come back and repeat that to fix it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The sense was, the Ra group had felt all these things and have gone through them, and so they were making themselves available to remedy/try to help this stuff which is why perhaps if Jesus was a creation of the Ra group.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t know if I’m saying that correctly:<span>&nbsp; </span>‘a creation of’; a co-creation [of the Ra group], because I’m sure the being Jesus was part of the Ra group, I think.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m not attached to being right on any of this.<span>&nbsp; </span>We did do a channeling, and I said, “When Jesus said ‘Father,’ who answered him?”<span>&nbsp; </span>The answer was, “The Ra group.”<span>&nbsp; </span>If you go through it you’ll see the connection where they were working to create Jesus in the lifetime of Akhenaton and even probably in the Ra Ta [lifetime] to bring in a being that could fulfill prophecy that people would look towards who could lift the vibration of the realm.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Even Jesus knew it was going to get corrupted; he knew that couldn’t be done without it being corrupted which is why he said so many things about the devil, warning about the devil – projecting about, “Those people will come in my name but they’re not really coming in my name…” I don’t have the quote.<span>&nbsp; </span>Beware just because somebody uses the name ‘Jesus’ basically they don’t necessarily carry the frequency of the Law of One or the Christed energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’re carrying a belief system, and it makes you more popular among certain people if you say you’re a Christian you’re easily accepted.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is one thing about being a Christian, which is like following a certain path and another thing that is holding the Christed energy, which means holding the frequency of oneness, holding the frequency of the Law of One.<span>&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t matter, even if you use a religion, it doesn’t matter if other people are your religion or not because they’re all part of the frequency.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When people start to identify their connection with God too strongly through their own religion, they’re probably losing it - a bit or a lot.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would assume the Elohim group and the Ra group have collaborated in history at different times, but I don’t know.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can cover that.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We have merged into a loose group with the Ra group for the purposes of bringing through information that is much and always the same; and we have, by bringing through in connection with Ra group, a bigger footprint, so to say.<span>&nbsp; </span>More frequencies are covered so that we, in combination with the Ra group, are easier to spot or to tag into, to sense.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">1: <span>&nbsp;</span>Was that the entire Ra group on Venus, or was the Ra group also on other planets?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2:<span>&nbsp; </span>Prior to Venus were there other planets of evolution that the Ra group went through?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
