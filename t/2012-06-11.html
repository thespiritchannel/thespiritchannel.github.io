<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hi everybody – it’s Monday night.<span>&nbsp; </span>My name is Wynn Free.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Monday, June 11<sup>th</sup>, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">, and this is our Monday Night BBS Call.<span>&nbsp; </span>I announced it as a Wild Card!; I said, “Let’s see what comes up and what we’re going to do.”<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re new to the calls: they’re always different but, they always have a theme.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s an unusual theme:<span>&nbsp; </span>the theme is that there are intelligences in other dimensions that are making themselves known to this realm through the work we’re doing; and, I’m sure through other people’s work.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re doing it in an unusual way because it’s rather public; it’s rather seat-of-your-pants.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although there’s an element of it which is sacred – we call it sacred – it’s also human.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">One of the things I’ve learned is that the more human you can be the better repeater station you can be.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although it’s exalted on one hand – and those people who are attending our calls regularly kind of understand what I mean – it’s also ordinary.<span>&nbsp; </span>But [it’s] not ordinary in the sense that it happens all the time in this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>To give you an example:<span>&nbsp; </span>I just came from the local coffee shop in Sedona where I live.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was busy on my computer, and there was this young fellow and a lady.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t think they knew each other; I think they started talking.<span>&nbsp; </span>They were talking about Tesla; and, they were talking about all of this kind of far-out stuff.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wasn’t going to say anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>I said, “I have work to do.”<span>&nbsp; </span>But then, I couldn’t resist it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I knew they would be really interested.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, I started talking and I said a little bit.<span>&nbsp; </span>The woman was saying, “I’m getting goose-bumps!”<span>&nbsp; </span>I could look and see: as soon as I start talking about this, I start connecting and they start coming in.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">I know that happens for me, and I become very, very familiar with the feeling.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve come even to the point where I’m confident in it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Believe it or not, it can happen for you as well; but, you have to become really familiar with it.<span>&nbsp; </span>And, you have to learn how to introduce it.<span>&nbsp; </span>The problem is: if you introduce it in the wrong way, it doesn’t sound ordinary.<span>&nbsp; </span>And, if it sounds too far-out, people go unconscious.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">In my case, I think one of the most powerful ways – I didn’t know how to introduce this.<span>&nbsp; </span>For a few years, I sat there and I said, “This is really important; I think it’s important.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think they are who they say they are.<span>&nbsp; </span>Where do you start?<span>&nbsp; </span>Where do you start talking about it and getting people interested without sounding exalted; without sounding holier-than-thou?”<span>&nbsp; </span>I think the idea is that you have to be more than you were to be worthy of doing it; you have to be very - I don’t even know the words.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">We do these calls three times a week.<span>&nbsp; </span>The thing about it is that this is a co-creation; these calls are a co-creation between us and them.<span>&nbsp; </span>The idea is that there are other dimensions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, we can’t see them, so for many of us the first idea of other dimensions sounds like a science fiction story.<span>&nbsp; </span>How do you know there are other dimensions?<span>&nbsp; </span>How do you know?<span>&nbsp; </span>How can you prove it?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">I don’t know if you can prove it scientifically; although I find – they did make the point – that as you increased your speed of travel, that time moved at a different speed.<span>&nbsp; </span>In other words – if there were a bunch of people getting in a spaceship traveling really fast, close to the speed of light (if that was possible) and they came back to Earth maybe they only aged five years or one year or a half year, or whatever.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yet, the people on the planet would have been a lot older; it could have been fifty or a hundred years that went by.<span>&nbsp; </span>It depends how fast they were traveling.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">One of the things that I have come to understand is that different dimensions could be looked at as different time lines.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are places where time moves at different speeds, and there are beings in those other speeds.<span>&nbsp; </span>It goes up, because time is moving at this speed and there another place where time is moving faster and another place where time is moving faster yet.<span>&nbsp; </span>In many cases, the beings and the intelligence on a given time line are not aware of the beings in another time line.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although, sometimes we become aware of that; people who can see ghosts; people who are psychic, people who can do healing usually can do those things because they’re starting to access other time lines.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">At the beginning of all the time lines, there is an intelligence.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s kind of a mystery down here: “Who is that intelligence?<span>&nbsp; </span>What are they?<span>&nbsp; </span>Are they real?”<span>&nbsp; </span>People down here can decide to call that intelligence God; they can decide to call it the One Infinite Creator; they could call it love, or spirit, or whatever name we have. It’s like far, far away; it’s like talking about another country across the other side of the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yet, when you’re talking about time lines it’s different than space-lines, with different spaces.<span>&nbsp; </span>If there’s another country across the planet </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">10,000 miles</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;"> away, that country is there and we are here.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s most definitely space that separates us, and never the two will meet.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">But, when you’re talking about time lines: it is possible for a human to move into different time lines and it’s also possible for certain intelligences in other time lines to move into this time line.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are certain people who have special abilities to be able to let those intelligences in other time lines speak through them.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are lucky enough to have two of the most extraordinary people on the planet who have gifted us with their presence, and the communications from these higher time lines.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, that’s Daphne and Terry.<span>&nbsp; </span>On many of these calls, we have communications from those other time lines.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Here is the challenge for a human who is listening and getting exposed to this: Are they really who they say they are?<span>&nbsp; </span>Are they really where they say they are?<span>&nbsp; </span>What’s the advantage of hearing these communications to me?<span>&nbsp; </span>There has to be some advantage – it could be a novelty but that wears out pretty quickly.<span>&nbsp; </span>And yet, there are all these people who keep coming and listening our calls and listening to our replays.<span>&nbsp; </span>I assume they’re getting some kind of benefit from it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know from the emails I get, some of them believe they’re feeling the energies, making the connections.<span>&nbsp; </span>Occasionally, sometimes, somebody gets a message.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re setting a reference point here on these calls – and the other work we do and in the books that I write and the e-mailings we do, and in messageaday – to make a bridge from other time lines to here.<span>&nbsp; </span>What’s the advantage?<span>&nbsp; </span>I think there are probably two main advantages for a human to get this.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">One of them – maybe there are more than two, I don’t want to limit myself – I’ll start out with two.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them is:<span>&nbsp; </span>We are humans and we are in this life.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re trying to figure it out:<span>&nbsp; </span>“What’s it all about, Alfie?”<span>&nbsp; </span>Why are we here?<span>&nbsp; </span>What’s the meaning of it?<span>&nbsp; </span>Where do we go when we die?<span>&nbsp; </span>Where did we come from before we were born?<span>&nbsp; </span>We are blinded to all those things.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our human senses perceive the physical world, and we perceive and smell and see and taste things that are physical.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yet, there is this idea that we are more than physical, and we exist in other realms but we don’t know it.<span>&nbsp; </span>How do we know that?<span>&nbsp; </span>We have this guidance from these sources, and they’re in other realms.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are constantly explaining how it works and how we look to them.<span>&nbsp; </span>That doesn’t mean you should believe them, but it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t believe them.<span>&nbsp; </span>You should take it in and consider it and not only look at the wisdom of it, but look at the energies that you feel as part of the connection.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Recently, we did a couple of readings for a couple of people – I would keep them anonymous; I’ll even keep the details of the readings anonymous.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t usually put out and talk too much about readings, but on the other hand I have watched people discover patterns that they would never had discovered if they didn’t get a reading.<span>&nbsp; </span>What do I mean by patterns?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">The idea is that we all have many lifetimes, and we keep coming back.<span>&nbsp; </span>Every time we come back, it’s a blank slate on one hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a blank slate because we don’t remember anything; we’re fresh in the world and we’re saying ,“What am I doing here?”<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, there’s an aspect to it which is not a blank slate, and that is that we carry patterns that we’ve established in other lifetimes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everybody has those patterns and they don’t know where they come from.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mostly we assume that’s who we are.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I was younger, that’s how I was: I said, “This is who I am.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have these hang-ups, I have these talents…”<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn’t know they were related to past lifetimes; how do you know that?<span>&nbsp; </span>You need a little more evidence than just somebody saying it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then we discovered that people tend to look like their past lifetimes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Occasionally, we have asked our sources – the one I put out to the public, but there are quite a few more – I asked Daphne (who is on the line):<span>&nbsp; </span>Was Terry ever anybody famous?</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">I was talking to the fellow at Starbucks; we were talking about that.<span>&nbsp; </span>He says “The Dalai Lama looks like all the other Dalai Lamas.<span>&nbsp; </span>In some circumstances with the Dalai Lama and within families, even – people keep coming back and they come back to their sect, to their organization or to their family.<span>&nbsp; </span>[It’s] one of the reasons I think there is such a drive for people to have children.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s an innate drive – it’s because when you have a child and you bring them up well; if you become wealthy and you put a lot of wealth into that family and leave a legacy, there’s a good chance at some point in the future, you’re going to end up back in that family as a grandson or a great grandson – whatever.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s a compelling subconscious desire to create a family for many people.<span>&nbsp; </span>I won’t say for everybody – it wasn’t for me this lifetime.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, for many people there’s a compelling desire to create a family unit because it creates a place for you to come back to.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you make it very comfortable and if you make it abundant and wealthy, then you come back into a wealthy environment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, life is easier in this realm when there’s money.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">On the other hand, life may be easier in this realm because there’s money, but you may be not having all the growth you could have if you’re brought up in a wealthy environment because you don’t have the challenges that force you to surface other elements of your being that – how do I say this?<span>&nbsp; </span>You can just slide through life; you can slide, glide, coast – you can coast.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ultimately that doesn’t necessarily make you happier.<span>&nbsp; </span>It can; depends on you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everyone is different.<span>&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t make you closer to God, necessarily, unless you have a family that’s close to God because then you’ll pick it up from your family.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, if you don’t, you’ll still feel like a human, you won’t connect to higher realms, and you’ll have a comfortable life.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’ll come back and you’ll have another comfortable life.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m sure there is every chance of randomness and probability that could be had as a result of these multiple incarnations.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">In my case, in this life time – I incarnated….<span>&nbsp; </span>I reverse engineer this; I don’t remember this, but I’ve had so much compelling evidence that I’m sure it’s true.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t want to tell all the stories to give the evidence, but I’ll tell you the end result.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had a reading from somebody years ago, and they told me about a past life that I lived.<span>&nbsp; </span>My father in this lifetime was a stranger, [in that lifetime], an innkeeper.<span>&nbsp; </span>He poisoned me; he gave me hemlock.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The way it was told to me was that because he poisoned me, he created an energetic connection so that I had the option – I didn’t have to, but I had the option – to be born through him in this lifetime.<span>&nbsp; </span>I reverse engineered that, and obviously I was born through him.<span>&nbsp; </span>On some level on the other side, I had to have made the choice to have him as a father. Except: my childhood was a nightmare, because the way the subconscious energy was between him and myself was – from his point of view – “Here’s that guy I thought I got rid of and here he is, my son.<span>&nbsp; </span>I totally reject him; what’s he doing here?”<span>&nbsp; </span>My father rejected me all the time I was growing up.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">We all need energy; it’s not that you shouldn’t need energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn’t used to understand that when I was younger; I thought one day when you get enlightened you just walk around like a glow worm and you’re with God and you don’t need anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, it’s not true – at least not to my experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’re in a human body and your body is an animal and your body has a nature.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you don’t honor it in some way, it rebels.<span>&nbsp; </span>It makes you sick, it gives you headaches.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each of us has a nature that we have to learn about “To thine own self be true.”<span>&nbsp; </span>The difference between the positive and the negative – let me just say this one thing – is that the negative wants energy, and they’re willing to abrogate the free will of everyone around them to get the energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>The positive will not take anyone’s free will away.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s the big distinction.<span>&nbsp; </span>That probably works through all the dimensions and through many of the negative realms from people in this realm and beings in other dimensions.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">According to Carla Rueckert – again, I use her because I learned a lot from studying her stuff, and it all dove-tailed into everything else I was learning.<span>&nbsp; </span>Carla is my guest once a month on our Monday night calls, so if you’ve been listening regularly, you’ve gotten to know her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many of you may not have read her Ra material which is available for free on her website; you can download it – llreseaerch.org.<span>&nbsp; </span>This kind of history that I’m sharing with you, you will never, ever find anywhere.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a mystery to the public, to the world, to the historians.<span>&nbsp; </span>In any case, Carla Rueckert said there was an Egyptian Pharaoh that Ra was talking to, and made an attempt but it kind of failed – but, there was an attempt made.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">His name was Akhunaton.<span>&nbsp; </span>Akhunaton outlawed all the religious practices of the priests.<span>&nbsp; </span>They were doing sacrifices, they were doing manipulations of the masses, they were creating fear that if people didn’t give them money that they would be cursed – that’s historic.<span>&nbsp; </span>That part of it is historic; Akhunaton outlawed it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Akhunaton’s wife was more famous than he was.<span>&nbsp; </span>His wife was Nefertiti.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of you have seen the picture of Nefertiti.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I was first with Daphne and she was channeling, I asked the question, “I know I exist in other dimensions; I have all kinds of synchronicities in my life.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Synchronicities are one sign that you’re moving your energy through this dimension into other dimensions. <span>&nbsp;</span>I said, “How do I connect with my own sources in other dimensions?<span>&nbsp; </span>How do I do that?”<span>&nbsp; </span>They said, “Write your dreams down.”</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">So, that night I put a pad by my bed.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had studied this whole process because that’s how David Wilcock started out.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I looked at the pad in the morning I found messages – verbal messages – like, “It’s the insanity of passion that makes things happen in the real world”; like “Through your dedication to love, serve and care the negativity goes away”; like “Communication from another dimension, just like Cayce – he slept to connect with this dimension.”<span>&nbsp; </span>At first I said, “I must be making this up.”<span>&nbsp; </span>My life was pretty crazy – writing the book about Wilcock, I’ve got Daphne channeling this voice that says they’re the Elohim and now I’m getting these dream messages.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Why did he change his name?<span>&nbsp; </span>The lower god was called ‘Amen’: Amen-Ra.<span>&nbsp; </span>The higher god was Aten-Ra; it was the moon god and the sun god.<span>&nbsp; </span>The sun god was the radiator of light and the moon god was the receiver of light.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contention was, the moon god was negative.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you use the word Ra among certain Christian groups, they will think that’s a pagan god, because Amen-Ra was the pagan god of </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Egypt</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">.<span>&nbsp; </span>I kept saying, “Why did they tell me Akhunaton’s right hand man was named Amenhotep?<span>&nbsp; </span>Why did they say that?<span>&nbsp; </span>Why did he have a right hand man [with that name] , since that’s the name that he denied for himself?”<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I pondered that for months.</span></p>
