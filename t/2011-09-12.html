<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Good afternoon, good evening, good morning, wherever you are. This is Terry Brown on the world-wide net and I am introducing the ‘Wynn Show’, which is Monday on BBS Internet Radio. We are very glad to meet with you on this Monday. Today is the 12<sup>th</sup> of September, 2011. If anyone is interested in hearing replays of the Monday night calls, they are archived on BBS Radio. You can go on your Internet to BBS Radio and take a look; you can listen to show on the web live on BBS Radio.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Right now we’re waiting for Wynn; we do a simulcast on Monday, where we have people on the phone line and we have people on the Internet radio. Usually what happens about now is that Wynn is out rounding up the people on the conference line, who call in from all over. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It’s an interactive call, so the people on the phone line can talk to Wynn unless they are muted. When we are doing the introduction and when we are channeling the topic, then they are muted so they cannot respond. But anytime he wants to, he can unmute them and they can ask questions. People can also call in if it’s that kind of day when he is asking for feedback or he is asking questions of the audience; people can also call in to BBS Radio if he puts out a request for people to call.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Here we are; it’s Monday; my name is Terry Brown. I often do channelings on the show. For quite a while, we had Carla Rueckert on the line, who was one of the first people to channel Ra. She has had a surgery and been laid up from that and so hasn’t been on the show lately. We’re hoping when she recovers a little more that she can be back on Mondays; she has very valuable information.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I first got into channeling in 1995. I had known Wynn since 1979 or 1980, when I first met him. For a while, we worked together. We were selling a product together and he and I were managers in that company. He then had other products he was selling and I sold some of the other products that he was selling and I even went to some of the state fairs and hired people to sell sunglasses. We have a lot of history together.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In 1995 I met Cherryl Taylor, who was a fairly famous channel and did things like discovering who were the perpetrators of crimes and finding lost submarines for the military; she had done a lot of good work; she was completely amazing. One day, Bob Nielsen who was in our class, dropped his cane over the balcony, it ended up in the flower gardens below and we couldn’t find it. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We were looking and looking for his cane and none of us could find it. Cherryl came out and said, “That’s the wrong way to look for something.” She put her hand to her head and she said “It’s right there!” and we all looked and there it was. She was a totally fantastic channel and she had a class on how to channel and I took the class. The first channeling that I did was part of the class.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Later, Wynn met Daphne and Daphne began channeling the Elohim. Once, after Daphne left the scene, the Elohim knocked on my head and then I started channeling the Elohim.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Wynn, are you on the line yet?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I see. It’s his usual contrary-side speaking.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I wonder who said “No”.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Gijs is generally the person who introduces people to the conference line. Take it away, Wynn.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So something started knocking you on your head, right?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. There was a pressure knocking on my head saying “We want to talk to Wynn.” I said, “Wynn is sleeping, so why don’t you just talk to me and get acquainted with me? We can get acquainted.” They said, “No. We want to talk to Wynn.” So I woke him up and he got out his tape recorder and they began to come through me.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I didn’t believe it though, at the time. I didn’t believe it was the same Source.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No, he didn’t believe it. He did have questions.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Did you believe it?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I did believe it, because there they were.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You could feel their frequencies, right?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I could sense that they were there; I could feel the frequencies; I could feel the pressure of them knocking on my head, “Hey, hey, hey!” to get my attention. I could tell because I can see spirits. It’s not like they had form; these guys didn’t really have form, but they had intelligence and frequencies.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But they didn’t have form?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No, not really. They didn’t have form; it’s like it was just an intelligence without form.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We have a real interesting topic tonight. The way this calls works, it started out as a conference call; then we went on BBS. If you’re listening for the first time, you can’t really believe we’re doing what we think we’re doing, probably, the first time you listen. It’s something that you have to thoroughly check out. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">What seems to be happening here is that we’re talking to Intelligences in other dimensions and they’re not just normal intelligences. In the track of all our conversations with them, they say they created the physical Universe. If you haven’t downloaded and read my book, you should: <i>The Creator Gods of the Physical Universe Want to Talk to You</i>. All you have to do is go to <i>creatorgodbook.com</i> and fill out your name and email and the book comes in your email.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Talking to a Source like that there’s a lot of unusual properties that happen associated with it, aside from getting information. I think, normally, when we think of ‘channeling’ we think, “I can get some really neat information. I can ask these Sources how to win in the stock market.” I never did that, but I did ask them how to win the horse races and they said it wouldn’t be a good idea to tell me. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The thing that is incredible about them is they said this originally with Daphne; that they were able to beam energy into this realm from their realm. I didn’t know what that meant. They said, “We beam Love Light energy.” We had many conversations; they said they created this realm. I asked them how they did that. They didn’t say, “Let there be Light”. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">They said there were these ‘shooting of frequencies’ and ‘spinningness’ and when frequencies were crossing it would create ‘nodes’. I was a Physics major at one point and I said, “I’m not sure I understand this, but I’m not sure I don’t understand it. I don’t know how Terry could ever come up with it”—but it made sense intuitively.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Just to bring people up to date, we’ve had many conversations with them. Originally, it was just myself and Terry or myself and Daphne. But now we do it live on these calls; we send audios to people; we do it in full view of everybody, which for a long time I was kind of scared to do. I said, “What if we say something wrong? What if we mislead anybody?” Eventually I got confident that that did not seem to happen. We ask questions on Monday and we pick a topic. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Tonight the topic is: “How Were Humans Created?”</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It’s a kind of controversial topic, because a typical religious person, of any religion, is going to have a very strong idea of how that occurred. On these calls, together with a lot of cross-referencing material, humans were originally created—well let’s go back.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The Elohim starts to create a physical Universe and they’re crossing frequencies and they’re creating solids. Then they’re creating the first instance of DNA and they’re creating the first instance of life. We’re never going to understand how they did that, as much as I ask them we’re not going to understand it; I had to ask them and it sounds like they know what they’re talking about; it’s hard to imagine in a human mind.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Over eons of time everything is evolving. Then they created life-forms; they talked about how they created the first amoeba. I don’t have a clear indication of how the amoeba became animals and humans, but we do know that Elohim souls started to come into this realm and occupy bodies. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">What we don’t know is, did they occupy special bodies they created just for themselves or did they occupy bodies that were already here, or both? They came into this realm and originally they could go back and forth. They could occupy a body and then go back. Then they got stuck here.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When they got stuck—this is not from our channelings; in Edgar Cayce’s readings they said they got stuck because of sex. They started having sex with the beings in this realm. Getting stuck wasn’t a punishment; the sex locked them in energetically to this realm. They got pulled into the energy field of a being that was locked into the realm, which locked them into this realm. That’s about as much as I can understand of how that works.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We go on and of the Elohim souls that were in this realm, some of them were positively oriented and some of them were not positively oriented—service-to-self and service-to-others. They had a lot of power in this realm, so they had the ability to control the other beings here. They were gold-mining on Earth, the way the stories go.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Their bodies were not so suited for the environment here and they wanted to genetically create beings in the Earth realm that could be their slaves and mine the gold. There was some kind of genetic manipulation between the Elohim who were in this realm, which I believe were called the Annunaki and-or the Nephilim, I’m not sure. I believe those were the two names that were applicable: the Annunaki and Nephilim.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In the Bible, they talk about the ‘sons of God’ mating with the ‘daughters of man’. They created humans to be their slaves; to mine the gold for them. Last week, we learned that the humans went into a kind of revolt; they were resisting this position of being slaves, and they tried to commandeer the spaceship of the Annunaki. They were not able to do it; they couldn’t figure out how to fly it; they blew it up, something like that. I believe that’s the way the story went; they blew it up.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Then there were a lot of annoyed Annunaki that said, “Let’s forget this human experiment and do away with them”. I didn’t ask all of these questions last week, so we can clarify some of them. The Annunaki were divided between “let’s do away with humans”, and “let’s nurture them back to evolution”. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Historically, this is on the Sumerian tablets that a Sumerian scholar named Zechariah Sitchin wrote a number of books about. There were two brothers that were leading the different factions. One was named Enlil and the other was named Enki. One of them took the side of “Let’s get rid of all the humans” and the other took the side of “Let’s nurture the humans”.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">If you read some of this stuff in history from Zechariah Sitchin and others—and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I tell people, if this sounds fascinating do a search on Enki and Enlil on Google—you’ll find many things about it from people who channel, people who have done archeology. What was happening was, the one brother, who wanted to do away with everybody, was planning to blow up the planet. Apparently he didn’t blow up the planet, but he destroyed all the life forms on it. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">By the way, there was an article in the <i>New York Times</i> this week about some scientists that discovered an unusual fossil, in South Africa—gold, right? It was a missing link between ape and humans and it had ape characteristics and a human hand and it was revolutionizing how they thought about the Darwinian Theory.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">See how crazy this all gets? It’s like maybe the Darwinian Theory is better than knowing all this. Apparently this is our roots; this is where we came from. The one brother blew up the Sinai Peninsula. There is still evidence, according to certain people, of radiation and a nuclear blast there. The other brother knew that this was going to happen and he decided to rescue some humans and some animals, so that the DNA template would not be lost and could continue. We’re going to find out today.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In that rescue event, was there a spaceship that took all these beings, these humans, up into space to preserve them when this explosion happened? Or was it Noah, who was given the instructions and help on how to build an Ark, and do it that way, or none of the above? Maybe I have it completely wrong.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I did study this enough, so we could ask some really good questions tonight. There’s another group that channels the Cassiopeians. I think the woman’s name is Laura and she happens to be friends with Carla Rueckert. There was a question asked to her Source and I haven’t studied her completely, but I figured if Carla knows her she has some kind of credibility. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">They were talking about the Ra material and they said, “How much of the Ra material is accurate? What percentage?” and she said, “70%”. I’ve never asked that question; I don’t think I want to ask it. Then the question was “How much is the Cassiopeians accurate?” and they said about the same. They said it varied from 65% to 95% and they said, “What made the difference?” </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The answer was the energy of the people present during the channeling; they held the purity of purpose that kept the channeling clear. You can all give yourself a pat on the back, those of you that are coming into the calls. I know that’s true, but I never heard anyone say that before.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When we are dealing with these group soul energies, we become part of the matrix and we become part of the safety and we become part of the accuracy. Of course, we’re learning as we go to do this publicly, like this. Before we go into the questioning, I’m going to open the lines and see if anyone has any particular things to ask about this particular topic? It has to be on this topic, okay? Are you curious about this?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Gijs:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Very curious, and I can’t wait to hear it.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Every Monday I have to choose what we’re going to talk about. Luckily, I never run out of topics. We could go on for eternity here, and new topics will come up as we go. One of the things about learning about this ancient creation stuff is for many of us, particularly those of us who are Wanderers who have come in from higher dimensions, all of this stuff is solving big cosmic puzzles and creates a cellular resonance, which helps awaken us.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">For many of us, either the Elohim or the Ra group might have been our Source family. Even if they weren’t, they take transients and they adopt people. This is a wonderful opportunity to get adopted by those guys, which is a great experience because you now know you’re not alone in this realm anymore. You’ve got a team supporting you in other realms. When that happens you know it; things change in your life; things occur. We have no questions. Terry, are you on the line?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Terry:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am; I’m here.</span></p>

<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Father-Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light, to surround and protect Terry, myself, everyone on this line and everyone who is listening on the replays and reading the transcripts. We invite those Sources that are positive, service to others, honoring The Law of One, to join with us and we create a protected space that only the Positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave now. We also combine with each other; I don’t think I said that. Those of you who free-willingly choose, we create a group energy, while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. Do we have our Sources present?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">This is Ra’An and we greet and welcome and express joy at making contact with each and every person on the line. We are mindful of the topic and the questions that have been asked. We see that the contact with Earth in the period of darkness at the period of time approximately 12,000, 13,000 years ago, there is a darkness that fell over the Earth.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Before that, civilization had become wide-spread and there was intergalactic travel, with space pods for landing in several countries, one of them being Egypt and one of them being South America. There was space travel and there was connection upon the trade routes which space ships maintain.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There were Earthlings that had been previously genetically altered to survive within the Earth atmosphere taking seed, genetic seed, from the starlings and from the Earth apes. They had made beings that were on Earth and able to survive on the Earth; however, the Annunaki did not feel that the Earthlings were of a sufficient intelligence to survive or to warrant the interaction.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">They wished, particularly Enlil, wished to start the project over. He did not like the independence that the Earthlings projected and felt that the Earthlings would not be able to fit into the galactic model of beings that could interact in a galactic sphere. They were too independent and too self-willed and not enough service-to-others, so he felt that they should be annihilated.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">His brother Enki felt that the Earthlings should be given every chance and both Enki and Enlil had descendants that were in the Earth sphere, the combination of their own genetic line and the apes. What we are going to tell you now has been blocked out from history and it created a black-out of the continuation of information flowing from the past history of Earth to the present, as it was so severe as to create a period when the destruction was so severe that the memory was blocked out.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">They blew up the Earth stations for interaction and this was blown up by Enlil and his descendants. This was not wished to be blown up, by Enki and this continued to be a blackout through which the history and the pass-down of historic facts was lost as the nuclear explosions were so intense that they could not remember and pass down information from generation to generation, as those generations caught in the cross-fire in this destruction were bound up in a tangle and could not remember.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The earlier incident, four million years ago, was when the gold-mining was established by the Annunaki on the trade route and they established an outpost on Earth to mine gold. They also had humans that they developed genetically to take over the mining of the gold as the Annunaki could not readily survive in the Earth atmosphere and they needed to develop beings that could survive, as the Earth atmosphere has many biological factors which then would disrupt the life-force of the star people they call Annunaki also known as the Nephilim.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">About five of the Earthlings in the particular surroundings of the gold mines felt they were very deprived and that the opulence of the spaceship people and the people on the spaceship was such that they lived a life of leisure and pleasure and they did not feel it was fair that they themselves had to work in the mines and to work with the loading of the gold. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">They wished to see what was beyond the Earth. When the spaceship landed to pick up its supply of gold—this was about four million years ago—they loaded the gold onto the spaceship, but they had a plan that they would take over and commandeer the spaceship and place in bondage the people flying the spaceship and make them take them to other areas to see what was beyond the Earth and to take part in the opulence that they saw in the spaceship. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">These five individuals, when the spaceship landed and the crew had loaded the gold onto the ship and it was ready to take off, made their move to take over the ship.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Some of them went on to the spaceship and they were confronted with weapons that they did not understand, and the remaining ones were set to release the spaceship, as there were mechanisms when the spaceship took off to move it from this dimension into a higher dimension and there were specific routines they had to perform. The individuals performing these routines were individuals that were taking over the spaceship, but they were not well-versed in how to release the spaceship and they released the spaceship before the timing pattern was such to turn it, move it, into the higher dimension. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The spaceship, being out of synch in its vibratory movement, then blew up. They did not intend it to blow up, but they did not know how to operate the mechanisms to release it into flight, so it blew up. This ended gold-mining for a while on Earth.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Then later on there were again movements and the establishment of space ports in South America and in Egypt and there were again the connections between the Annunaki and the humans and again, the Annunaki felt superior and they felt that the humans were not being cooperative and they, under Enlil, purposefully blew up the space ports to prevent other interaction between the Annunaki and the Earthlings. Do you have further questions?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes, I do. You started out talking about 12,000 B.C. and then you went back to four million B.C. Obviously 12,000 B.C., according to all my information, was the time that Atlantis blew up and the approximate time of Ra Ta in Egypt, bringing in Atlantians and welcoming them to Egypt. Historically we have this indication of Noah, who rescued a lot of beings at the time of a great flood. Was this connected to the destruction of the Earth, either four million years ago or 12,000 years ago, or were there similarities in both periods?</span></p>

Were those Annunaki who were mining gold aware of the celestial Elohim? Were some of them aware of the celestial Elohim at that time?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No.</span></p>

The reptilians were foreign to the Annunaki and they had abhorrence of them, so the souls that came into the reptilian group tended to be of a lower nature and more of them would identify with the Belial group.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Belial group, yes. Today we might say, that in many human bodies there’s a cross-current of DNA which is reptilian, Annunaki and ape. If that’s the case, does that mean a human can be shifting with a resonance through their lifetimes between one group and another? Would that be common?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One could find problems in overcoming certain tendencies of a group with the certain genetic characteristics and could have difficulty that could provide growth to them for overcoming those certain tendencies or traits of the seed. It was not only three groups; there was not only Annunaki and reptilians and the ape. It was also the Pleiadians and also a group from the Andromeda System and other groups that were mixed in, to give a wider base for the expansion of humans. When the individuals were born, some of the children would revert to one star group over another and would have particular gifts or particular adversities.</span></p>

<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes, the DNA of many star groups was collected on the trade routes from different star systems and was collected as a prize by the genetic scientists. They then would use these mixes to see what they could come up with that would be stronger mixes, more intelligent and more able to survive in the Earth atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That was the Annunaki that were doing that?</span></p>

<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When we’ve read how the Earth was a mixture of beings from many different star systems taking incarnations here, it was the Annunaki moving through all these systems and picking up the DNA that were creating that?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They were creating the new individuals scientifically and making them available to Earth. It was not only through sex that this was propagated; it was through the modification by adding different genes of different groups to the fertilization of the eggs and different experiments to inject different genetic seeds into the ovum that they could experiment. Many of the creatures that were born were rejected and put to sleep, as they did not work. But one in perhaps very many, like a million, would be an exceptional being.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We have groups on Earth that are very different, obviously with different genetics. For example, the Chinese have different bodies, different appearances and different make-ups; their qualities are quite different than Caucasians in their personalities, in the way they think. Could we use that as an example and perhaps understand; were the Chinese part of the Annunaki experiment?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Give us a moment. There were different groups that came to Earth as outposts and were started much like the Europeans came to America, like Columbus. There were different space groups and in the period when the expansion of the people on Earth was taking place, before the destruction, people were outposted in groups and these groups developed together in relative isolation within a certain area and hung together and so reproduced with different qualities.</span></p>

<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We get a section of Andromeda, Andromeda Five.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And Native Americans, do they have a particular star system that they’re related to?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They were a mix and they mixed with and blended with groups from the Siberian and from the South American as those groups moved toward America. They were blended while they were still here, with other groups.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. I think the last question for tonight; maybe I’ll ask one more after this, because this may not have a happy ending. Of all those beings that were destroyed by the flooding or the nuclear disasters, or whatever, what happened to their soul matrices? Did they end up being tangled web messes of souls matrices like happened on Maldek? Did they get untangled?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes. The individuals who were blown up within the Sodom and Gomorrah area and within the Indian area ended up very much in trouble and as to reconstruction of their soul matrix and unable to operate and have been seeking, struggling to work it through. The individuals who did not get involved in those blasts carried on to become the people of today; however this blast wiped out memory of what happened.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So it was traumatic; that tangled mass still exists right now?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes and struggling, also the karma of that blast with the land. That is one reason that it is such a hot spot, as it is the area of the Indian and Pakistan border.</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Did the Annunaki get karma with this whole episode with humans? Did they get bound into it?</span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';">Ra’An:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some of the Annunaki got bound into it and took Earth bodies with the desire of straightening this all out and still are working on it.</span></p>

It is 7:05 and we’ll bring this session to a close. Is there anything else that you would like to share before we finish? Thank you so much for being so available to bring this unusual understanding of the history of humans to all of us. Anything else you’d like to share?</span></p>

This can benefit all of Earth, because as it rides as an unconscious overlay in the past of Earth, individuals, in an unconscious manner, take it on and tend to dramatize it. </span></p>
<p class="NormalTrebuchetMS"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We would like to lift into the higher realms of Light this overlay, that it can be cleared from the Earth field.</span></p>
