You’re part of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">all that is?&nbsp; I’m not part of all that is??&nbsp; Well…”&nbsp; So,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">immediately by talking about it, you’ve separated yourself from</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the person you want to reach.&nbsp; You can’t talk about it, you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">have to be it.&nbsp; Learning how to be it takes a little bit of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">practice.&nbsp; One of the things I’ve learned is that - I’ve</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">learned this doing these calls to tell you the truth.&nbsp; Because,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">when I first started doing the calls and I was talking about</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">having conversations with an intelligence that said they created</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">this realm, I said, “What are people going to think of me?&nbsp; How</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">do I talk about that?”&nbsp; Over time, I learned that the more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">ordinary I was, the more human I was, the more people could</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">relate. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Because if you just talk about an intelligence that created this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">realm that perhaps has played the part of God, one of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">intelligences that played the part of God throughout our history?</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">&nbsp;Man, that’s intimidating.&nbsp; How do you work with that in a real</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">way?&nbsp; There’s a great tendency, and I had this and some of you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">have had this – “Just tell me what to do, I’ll do it.” </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Of course you would do it, except they don’t tell you what to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">do because the trick of the whole thing is that if you’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">following orders you are now just following orders and you’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">not co creating.&nbsp; The key is always to co-create.&nbsp; You’re part</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">of them; they’re part of you.&nbsp; When you can move into the space</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">of being part of them, now when you create an intention, when you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">create an idea, of doing something you now have all these extra</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">spark plugs going.&nbsp; Because it’s not just you it’s you and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">them and it’s you and me, we’re extra spark plugs because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">we’re co-creating these calls - because you’re listening to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">these calls.&nbsp; (Because) Terry and I are co-creating.&nbsp; We’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">just, she’s she, I’m me and the combination of the two of us</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">is:&nbsp; things happen that would not happen for either of us by</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">ourselves.&nbsp; So, that’s the magic of co-creation.&nbsp; There’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">spontaneity, there’s being in the moment, there’s relating to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">people as who they are.&nbsp; There’s not needing to have people say</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">to you, “Oh, aren’t you great?”&nbsp; or this or that.&nbsp; You can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">do things and it doesn’t matter what people think. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Suddenly, everyone is attracted to what you’re doing because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">when it matters what people think, then unconsciously people know</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">that you care what they think and they control you.&nbsp; They control</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">you because they can use their thoughts to give approval to you. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">By giving approval, you get a certain little blast of energy of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">approval and that feels good – and, that’s human recognition,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">that’s not a divine experience, this is a human experience. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">The approval then makes you become dependent, and they then will</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">attempt to control you through their approval.&nbsp; All of this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">happens at such a subtle level that you don’t know it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">happening. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">And, if it’s happening you can’t blame the other person for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">doing it.&nbsp; You might even look and see that you do it; that you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">use approval of others as a way of controlling them.&nbsp; It’s not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">bad, it’s just one of the ways that you start losing your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">connection with all that is, because you start craving approval;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">you start craving recognition.&nbsp; Then when you don’t’ get it,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">you’re feeling lonely, you’re feeling empty, and you’re in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">this stuck place because you keep going, “How can I get more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">approval?”&nbsp; “Isn’t there somebody out there to love me?” </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">“I’m all abandoned, nobody will ever love me.”&nbsp; It’s a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">cycle that repeats itself, but it’s what came out here at the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">beginning and I’ll just go with it. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">The real topic is I think something that is on everyone’s mind</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">right now.&nbsp; It relates to what’s going on in the world and how</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">this radiation is going to impact us. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">A long time ago, when I was first having discussions through</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Daphne, I asked them, “Is all life going to be destroyed on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">this planet?”&nbsp; The answer was “It was possible.”&nbsp; There</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">would have to be a predisposition of negative choice - that was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">their terminology, for that to occur. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">This radiation that’s been leaking from Japanese reactors – I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">get emails about it all the time – how dangerous it is, and how</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the whole planet is going to get cancer, and blah blah.&nbsp; On the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">other hand, I ask questions about it to our sources. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">When we are working with channeled information, I am never going</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">to tell you to believe it at face value.&nbsp; Put it in your computer</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and consider it, but there’s no way - #1: there’s no way to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">know scientifically that they are who they say they are.&nbsp; #2: </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">there’s always a possible bleed-through from Terry’s own</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">consciousness.&nbsp; Terry listens a lot to the radio; she listens to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">George Noory, she could potentially pick up an idea, and suddenly</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">it blends in with the source message, and it may be part of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">something that blended in.&nbsp; #3: I don’t believe this happens. I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">don’t believe this happens, but it’s possible - a negative</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">source could co-opt the channel and suddenly negate a positive</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">source and give wrong information.&nbsp; Given all those three</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">possibilities, we can only take it, integrate it and watch it for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">a while and see if it holds fast. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">We’re going to be discussing topics tonight that I can’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">validate.&nbsp; They’re going to answer questions that I can’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">personally validate myself.&nbsp; I can validate certain wisdoms, like</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">even if you go back to Jesus, and Jesus said, “Where two or</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">more are gathered I am also present.”&nbsp; I understand that, I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">understand that we do that on this line that when we gather and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">we create a group energy – there’s a certain energy that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">comes in that’s not me, that’s not you, or it’s a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">combination of all of us and the higher forces and it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">magical, and it only happens when there’s people gathered.&nbsp; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">can’t do it myself and sit around.&nbsp; I can feel the energy</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">myself, but it’s never at the same level that happens when</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">we’re on this call together.&nbsp; It’s a different quality of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">energy. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Where Jesus said, “When two or more are gathered”, I don’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">need to believe that, I know that’s true.&nbsp; There’s a number</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">of other things Jesus said; there’s a number of things our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">sources say that I just know are true.&nbsp; When they predicated a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">newspaper headline in advance – nobody could validate that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">until the newspaper headline happened.&nbsp; When we talk about these</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">things, we’re not dictating truth for you; we’re dictating</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">here’s an interesting perspective from a source that has</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">demonstrated their ability.&nbsp; </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">One thing I think many of us have experienced is the energy comes</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">in on this line and that feeling of love and care that goes</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">through you, that it’s an unusual experience because it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">coming in not from me; it’s coming, maybe some of you that have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">your chakras open feel it coming in from the top of your heads. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">So our sources say that’s them – they say that.&nbsp; You hear</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">this voice but that energy coming through is them, and so we have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">this very precious experience of feeling energies from an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">intelligence - I call it an intelligence, I don’t know what the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">right word is - but an intelligence outside this dimension that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">is fairly rare for people to feel and then we talk about it. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Terry - usually I say “Terry, do you have anything to say from</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">your human side?”&nbsp; She says, “Let’s get on with it!”&nbsp; Do</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">you have anything to say from your human side? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; I was noticing – we had, I think it was in early April</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">- it was really amazing because it started, it was raining, snow</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">was not predicted and it got kind of cold.&nbsp; I woke up in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">middle of the night and I looked out the window and the snow was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">gleaming like jewels; it looked was sparkling like a diamond</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">would sparkle.&nbsp; These little rays of white would go *ding!” </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">And I thought, “That’s really unusual; does snow do that?” </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">I looked for a moon, because it seemed like a moon-lit night it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">was so light out.&nbsp; But yet, it was snowing and there were clouds</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and I couldn’t find the moon.&nbsp; So I just thought, “That’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">really strange.” </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">That night, it froze all the plums, it froze the persimmon trees</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">around here, it froze a lot of stuff and because it got cold. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">But then, I went over to visit the neighbor and the neighbor</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">said, “You know, I think the snow was radioactive.”&nbsp; So, I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">went into the internet and I was looking on the internet and they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">were talking about - there was radioactivity from Japan in a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">storm that had hit Japan that was then expected to hit in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">western United States. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">I just thought that was an interesting point that happened there,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and there was a little bit of radioactivity that was picked up in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the milk in Phoenix.&nbsp; Anyway, those were two things from my human</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">side that I noted. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; There was one video by a fairly respected</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">person that was on U-Tube that was almost indicating that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">humanity was doomed, that the quantities of plutonium that are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">being released from Japan had to be fatal; and, it only took a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">small amount to kill somebody or to give them cancer.&nbsp; So we did</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">some conversations about it, and channelings, and I asked and the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">answers were very interesting.&nbsp; Since we’re going to be talking</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">to them we will let you hear those answers live, because I’ll</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">ask them again. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">So on that note I’m going to call in the light; the invocation</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">to the light.&nbsp; Really, this is an invocation, a high intention on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">my part, to create a vibration of oneness, where we all meet in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">another dimension, a higher dimension, where our energies</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">co-mingle and our sources can co-mingle with our energies because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">we are lifting our vibration above the veil.&nbsp; That’s what this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">invocation is, and if you’re listening to this call and you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">haven’t listened to our Sunday calls, then I hope you take</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">advantage and listen, because we focus on creating this energy on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Sunday, we focus on it.&nbsp; For many people, that focus helps to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">bring them you into the experience. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Father Mother God we ask for the presence of the light to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">surround and protect each person on this call and any negativity</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">be taken to the higher realms of light and transmuted for the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">highest good of all concerned.&nbsp; We see ourselves in the flow of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">energy radiating from the center of the universe through the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">through the sun, through the outer energy fields of our planet,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">through our bodies and grounded into the earth, to the center of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the earth.&nbsp; Right now we invoke a group energy connection, a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">blending of our energy fields, which we can’t see but we can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">feel.&nbsp; There is something that happens when we do this and we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">invite those sources that are positive, service to others,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">honoring the Law of One to join with us as we create a protected</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">space that only the positive has access and anything not of that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">nature must leave now.&nbsp; I await our sources to indicate their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">presence with us.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We are here.&nbsp; This is Ra’an, April 25th 2011, planet</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">earth, Sedona , Arizona - focused as a touch down point with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Terry and Wynn and also contacting and touching and available to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">each and every person watching, listening – on BBS, listening</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">on the conference line, looking at a transcript at any time</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">anyone may read or listen to this, and we send our love. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">‘Send’ is a funny word because we are right there in all time</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and a oneness with each and every one of you there. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">We are mindful of the topic to do with radiation, and we are a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">radiant energy but we do not make changes; we are a free-will</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">energy that is available and does not leave particles in it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">wake, as does the radiation, as the radiation in part,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">particularly when it is brought into the food supply, imparts</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">particles which remain in the thyroid or other areas of the body</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and create an energy imbalance there.&nbsp; So one of the things that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">individuals can do when they have been exposed to radioactivity</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">is to raise their frequency, the frequency of their body, so that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the particles can move on and are not at this great divergence of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">energy between the energy of the radioactive iodine, say, and the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">energy of the rest of the body.&nbsp; Do you have questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; Could you share how radiation got started?&nbsp; Like,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">radiation is an unusual property in this realm, it’s different</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">from anything else.&nbsp; I wouldn’t be the first to say, “I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">don’t understand it.”&nbsp; In the history of creation how and why</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">– the idea of radiation, the radioactive rocks, come about?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; The radioactive materials have an imbalance.&nbsp; There is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">a higher energy that is in the core of the material and the outer</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">layers are somewhat destabilized and after they have been</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">utilized in the core of the reactor, they’re even further</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">destabilized so that they do not have the proper spins of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">exterior of the particle, and therefore there is a seeking out</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">from the core to grab, gain, pull into itself, energy. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">The particles are imbalanced, and they burn as they are a very</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">high frequency, burning is a very, very high frequency – fire</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">is very high frequency.&nbsp; We look at which way we should explain</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">this.&nbsp; When this high frequency comes in contact with matter,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">then the lower frequencies around it tend to collapse into the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">higher frequencies. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">We ourselves have a very high frequency, but we do not collapse</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">fields because we do not require energy be brought to us; we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">bring our own complete energy.&nbsp; Radioactivity has an incomplete</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">energy; fire has an incomplete energy, where it seeks to take by</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">force other energies and bring it to its frequency, trying to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">complete itself.&nbsp; Do you follow so far?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I do.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; So, when individuals work with reactive material, with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">uranium, and they take its energy further, then it is so</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">destabilized, it needs the spinningness on the outside of it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">orbits, of it’s particles, to come back to itself.&nbsp; It craves</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and it seeks; it gets heat from its surroundings, and it heats up</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and tends to get hotter and hotter in frequency where you get a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">meltdown as it is seeking so hard to complete itself because it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">is missing parts of the stable molecule that makes up the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">material. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Uranium is somewhat destabilized, but then as you take heat out</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">of it, it becomes more and more destabilized until the point</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">where it grabs heat so hard it just heats up higher and higher</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">frequencies until it is melting and at huge temperatures because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">it does not have the stabilization of the outer rings, the outer</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">orbits, the outer electrons, which are spinningnesses which</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">balance the core, and the core becomes destabilized and shrieking</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">out at a very high frequency and taking to itself heat, more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">heat, to try to balance.&nbsp; So with nuclear reactive waste - what</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">could be done would be to run it through magnetic processes of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">bringing in materials where it could refurbish it’s molecular</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">orbital counts and reestablish the proper spins for it and it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">will then stabilize.&nbsp; Do you have further questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; We didn’t quite address the question that I asked.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">&nbsp;The question that I asked was, “How and why did radioactive</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">materials become part of our universe?”&nbsp; Was it something that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">was created by some humanoid aliens at some point for some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">reason, was it something that was created by the higher forces</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">because there was a reason for it to be here? What was the first</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">instance of radioactive material in this realm, and why?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> The radioactive material was formed in layers and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">pockets wherein the surrounding materials, as they heated and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">cooled did not provide – we wish a different track of thought</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">here – it provided a way for different elements to be formed,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and different substances to be formed based upon the cooling and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">heating and spins available within the layers of matter as matter</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">manifested and condensed out of the various spinningnesses in an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">area. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">The different spinningnesses around a core material formed</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">different elements.&nbsp; Some of the elements were iron; or if you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">take a look at the periodic chart you will see different</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">materials, they were formed as the matter congealed and came to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">homeostasis in a different spin-status for different conditions. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">So, it was a part of the natural creation of the universe.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So, it was a result of certain materials being in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">proximity to other materials, and the interaction created this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">phenomenon of radioactivity?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> That is correct.&nbsp; That is correct.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And, the radioactivity tends to screw up energy</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">fields, which then causes us to get sick or die?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Trying to put it in the simplest of languages?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; When an individual enters a radioactive area, the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">symptoms are nausea as the body systems are beginning to be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">affected by the radioactivity.&nbsp; There is an interaction between</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">biological systems and radioactivity wherein the radioactivity</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">enters into the body system and begins to redirect the flow and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">upset the matrix.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; It was indicated that if a human was very focused and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">centered, then their vibratory field would be strong enough to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">not be impacted by the radiation, yes?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> That is correct.&nbsp; Much as an individual who does a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">fire-walk and is able to steel his body, make his body amenable</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">to different frequencies so the body is able to simply walk</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">through the hot coals without being burned, much as that is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">possible it is possible since the fire, and the heat is a very</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">high frequency, that the person can harmonize with and walk</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">through the fire without getting burned.&nbsp; So radioactivity is a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">very high frequency and the individual, if he/she can move their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">body to that frequency they can move through the radioactivity</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">without adverse affect.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Of course, fear would be the thing that would break down</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the system so the person would be more vulnerable to being</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">damaged?&nbsp; Is that true?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Fear would move them to a lower frequency which would</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">place the discrepancy between the frequencies of the radiation</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and the individual at a greater level and they would receive more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">damage.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; From the Elohim’s point of view and the Ra</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">group’s point of view, since you’re at the beginning of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">universe, do you have the ability to shift radiation and go into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">it – so, is that a violation of free will for you to do that? </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Or, do you have the ability to do that?&nbsp; Can we ask for that?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We have the ability to do that; however, it is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">dependent upon consensus reality.&nbsp; The more solidly that people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">believe that they will be injured by radioactivity and that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">radioactivity is a stable fact, they are placing in it an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">encasement in that frequency and placing the discrepancy between</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">their frequencies very high, at a very high discrepancy.&nbsp; So,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">once this is set into consensus reality, it is harder to simply</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">move the radioactivity around in frequency.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Because the people are holding it in place by their own</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">thought forms?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; That’s correct.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So maybe in some ways, it’s not good to know about</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">radioactivity and go about your life as if it didn’t exist. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">(Because) If you hear it on the news for example, it could create</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the fear that causes more vulnerability to it?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Well, yes and no, in that people are affected by</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">consensus reality whether or not they pay attention to it, and if</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">they were aware of this factor and aware of the ability to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">increase their frequency to be able to harmonize with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">radioactivity, then they would have a chance to take this into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">account and to move into a higher state.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So in terms of what would be in our highest good to know? </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Can you share the potential impact of the radioactive-release</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">materials in Japan?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We would say that there has been, even before Japan , a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">huge release of radioactive material.&nbsp; If we use radioactive</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">material, as the American Government particularly uses</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">radioactive material in their missiles and their bombs, they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">expose – it is in the form of depleted uranium – and they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">expose individuals who come in contact with the dust or materials</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">from these bombs; that already is increasing a higher rate of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">children deformities in Iraq.&nbsp; If we look at the earth, we see</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">that there are areas where already there is too high (levels of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">radiation), even within that area, it is focused, localized into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">spots and this creates birth defects which then can even be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">passed onto another generation. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">So looking further than to Japan , as we look over the area of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Fukushima, we see an area that is laden with radioactivity and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">within a ring around the city, around the reactors, that is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">creating a tendency – it is hard for a body within this area,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">within the frequency of the human range – to survive in this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">area.&nbsp; We see that it has moved up into the atmosphere; we do see</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">a dusting, a very far-reaching range, which we see it moving up</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">in the air and then falling and coming into the rain and coming</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">into the snow in areas along the line of the stream of flow of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">air which moves east from Japan and to some degree in some other</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">directions. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">There is a background radiation at all times; and, this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">background level varies also – there is also gamma radiation</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">from the sun.&nbsp; Not all radiation is bad, as it - some radiation -</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">can be used by the body much as a marker, a marker or level that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the body can use as a reference point to build around, to operate</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">from, as much as someone might live near a mountain and when they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">come home, “Oh yeah, there’s the mountain, it’s the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">marker.”&nbsp; So radioactive activity is a sort of a marker for the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">matrix of a body.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I’ve read on the internet that there’s been posted</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">about the positive aspects of radiation for health, even - maybe</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">not high doses, but low doses.&nbsp; Some people say it has a positive</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">impact.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes, and it does have a positive impact because the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">matrix can use it as one of its markers.&nbsp; A body gets used to a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">certain level of radiation, using it for a reference point.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">individual then, if they experience a sudden heightening of this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and are aware that they can move their frequency with it.&nbsp; It’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">telling the body, we could tell bodies everywhere that they can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">move with the marker, with the radiation marker, and instead of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">being doggedly fixed at a certain level of radiation in their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">comfort zone, can move with the marker.&nbsp; Then, that would greatly</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">enhance the human race’s ability to withstand radiation.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; What can we expect in this country from the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">radiation that’s been coming from Japan?&nbsp; What are some of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">possible outcomes from it?&nbsp; Will it become dangerous?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; You can expect a higher incidence of cancer,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">particularly in the farmlands where individuals are drinking more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">milk and growing food and eating it fresh, as they - once the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">milk and vegetables have gone to stores, the iodine level has</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">fallen and they have not eaten the foods fresh.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Could we say that organic milk might be more dangerous</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">than homogenized milk?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> It is more a factor of the amount of time before the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">milk is drunk. As giving it a little more time gives the chance</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">for the radioactive iodine, which lasts eight days, to be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">dispensed.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; How about water?&nbsp; Are they dumping radioactive water into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the oceans right now?&nbsp; If so, how will that impact us?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> They have been dumping radioactive water into the ocean</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and there has been leakage into the ocean.&nbsp; We put out that the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">half life of all radiation can be shortened and lowered in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">time that it is harmful.&nbsp; Much radiation lasts 600 years or more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">so that something like this we ask that can be shortened, but it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">is still a long time.&nbsp; Better we ask that the individual bodies</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">have a different ability instead of to rely upon the certain</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">background radiation marker, to be able to be more flexible and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">to move with the markers and to release radioactivity back out of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">their body.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Any other particular tips on how people can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">deal with these enhanced levels of radiation?&nbsp; Should they stay</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">indoors more?&nbsp; Are there certain foods which are more dangerous? </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">I mean, any ways of protecting ourselves?&nbsp; We know potassium</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">iodide or iodine helps protect the thyroid, but there are other</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">sources of radiation as well.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; They can eat kelp, which has iodine in it.&nbsp; They</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">can wash their vegetables carefully.&nbsp; They can ask to have their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">own frequency heightened of their own body so that they can be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">invisible to the radiation, so to speak.They can watch the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">weather patterns where storms are coming from the area of Japan. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Those are our comments.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; If we had more people on this line having more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">impact on consensus reality, could that make a significant</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">difference to this kind of a problem?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Definitely.&nbsp; The more people that you have on the line</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the more difference it makes to consensus reality.&nbsp; Also the more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">passionate each individual is and the more intention they carry</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">that would make the difference for ten people if they have enough</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">intention and passion.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; You mean ten people could be very powerful, that provide</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">intention and passion?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But one person can be equal to ten people if they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">are passionate enough and have enough intention.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So this is what Jesus said, “With the faith of a mustard</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">seed you can move a mountain”?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Same idea?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; We’re going over.&nbsp; I think it’s okay.&nbsp; If Seth is on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and we have to get off, just come on and interrupt us Seth. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">I’ll ask the question - is there anything else you’d like to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">share on this topic before we move on?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> We look at the area and we do see the human race has an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">ability to adjust, and there is something where one individual</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">may have genetically the strength to withstand the radiation</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">without a problem; another may not genetically be so inclined, or</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">a combination of the genetics and willfulness (will make a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">difference) and having not enough intention, not enough</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">stick-to-itiveness or steadfastness, these individuals then would</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">be weeded out and the stronger individual who was able to move,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the individual who was strong enough to move his matrix with the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">conditions would be able to then co-create.&nbsp; The individuals that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">were stronger would be able to make the whole race stronger.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I’m going to take a moment right now and ask</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">all of you to bring your intention to a high place and take a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">moment of silence to put your vote in for the shifting of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">consensus reality; let’s just shut out eyes and hold that space</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">of “no radiation”, disabling of radiation, no harm.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> We suggest not “no radiation”, but an optimum</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">level.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; An optimal level of radiation for health.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Okay, I’d like to just mention to all of you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">that what we just did is something we do every Sunday on our grid</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">healing.&nbsp; I hope you will join us and add your intentions to that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">program.&nbsp; I also want to announce that I’m going to do</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">something in the next few days. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">One of the challenges to this group is how to make it expand and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">how to introduce it to more people in a way that flows.&nbsp; I know</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">many of you have talked to your friends and oftentimes they run</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">the other direction – it’s very hard to explain.&nbsp; One of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">things I am going to do and I hope you all will help on this.&nbsp; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">have a book called The Creator Gods of the Physical Universe Want</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">to Talk to You.&nbsp; Many of you have read that and we have been</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">selling it for $16 at www.elohimqanda.com. In the next couple of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">days, I’m going to do a two week give-away of that download and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">I want you all to share it with everyone you know.&nbsp; I’ll be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">putting up a link and when people get the download, after a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">couple of weeks they’ll automatically end up in messageaday. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Of course they can unsubscribe any time they want but it’ll</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">give them the opportunity to understand what we’re doing. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">Most of you, if you note, when you subscribed to messageaday you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">really didn’t know what it was.&nbsp; You came in to read some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">excerpts from my book; you saw some Google Ad Words.&nbsp; You can’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">really tell people what this is until they move themselves, and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">they need something to help them move themselves.&nbsp; So I am hoping</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">that doing the book give-away, maybe if everyone sends it to two</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">or three people and they send it to two or three people suddenly</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">we can start a roll going and then have thousands of new people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">in our group.&nbsp; So pay attention this week for a notice and a link</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">on that, and I hope you’ll support that and pass it around. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">On that note - I thank BBS for letting us go over and we’ll</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">bring this session to a close.&nbsp; Thanks everyone that’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">listening, everyone that’s listening to the replays and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">everyone that is volunteering to help keep this show on the road</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">– particularly the people who are coming into the conference</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">call.&nbsp; All of those people are actually helping hold the energy</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">for these calls to take place.&nbsp; This is a group call even though</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">most of you are just listening, some of you experience how your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">energy is connecting and creating the space so this can be made</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">public.&nbsp; It’s very rare to do this in a public way like this,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">and have protection and you folks are creating it.&nbsp; So I thank</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">you all, the lines are open.&nbsp; You can say goodbye, everyone will</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;">hear you – we’re still recording.&nbsp; We’ll see you next time!</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp; Good night (from all) and thank you!</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Chris:</strong>&nbsp; Goodbye brother Wynn!</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Good night, Chris.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Lisa:</strong>&nbsp; Good night, Terry.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; color: #000000; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Good night.</span></p>
