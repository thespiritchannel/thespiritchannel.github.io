<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Don’t mention names, okay?<span>&nbsp; </span>“Should I marry Stan?” or, “Should I come to </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Arizona</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">?”<span>&nbsp; </span>There are people who have asked those questions recently and I can feel them thinking about it and they said “Uh oh, I shouldn’t have asked that question.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Actually, it’s a legitimate question, because your choice of partners is very important, or can be very important because according to some of the stuff I’ve read and some of the experience, maybe this never occurred to you, but one of the fastest ways to open up your energies – this is going to be controversial – is through sex, because sex has the potential to by-pass every other circuit, every other hang-up in your body and get energies flowing and open up your DNA.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Even in one of the readings we did through Daphne where we talked about the hybrid humans, the humans that were the offshoots that were meant to be used as slaves; they were trying to keep their DNA compressed.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was said, through sex they started opening up their chakras and that’s how they started to evolve, because it’s in the loving energies in the people’s hands that the chakras open up.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Sound of typing.) Is somebody typing this all out?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So I’d say I’d concur; I think everybody here on the call probably has had some experience similar to this.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m glad we’re going down this road.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>The real problem is having the right person, the right partner because it’s never just sex.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a total exchange of universes, and what happens so often and where it gets stuck is where (people are at different levels of evolvement.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m not telling anybody what to do; these are hard issues to resolve.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m laying it out on how to consider it but I’m not giving advice to say, “Leave your partner” or “Be promiscuous,” either one.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m just saying how it seems to work because when you come together with somebody, you have a total movement into someone else’s universe and their’s into yours.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When you happen to be more evolved, that doesn’t put you on an ego trip to think you’re better than someone else.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s hard to find the right words to use; even people who are very expanded can have the most tragic and difficult times in this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>Being expanded doesn’t mean that you’re better than, that everything comes easy – it doesn’t mean that.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, what it does mean is that other people are contracted, more contracted, than you – it’s hard to find someone who matches your level of expansion.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you get into a relationship with someone who is contracted – remember, contracted doesn’t mean bad because everyone is at their own place.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve all gone through many lifetimes and we’ve had lifetimes where we were contracted; so it’s not to judge or evaluate, it’s just to observe.<span>&nbsp; </span>The person who is more expanded has to contract to match the energy of the person who is contracted because the person who is contracted doesn’t have the ability to expand to match the person who is expanded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then what happens is the person who is expanded is contracting and over a period of time they can easily forget themselves and lose themselves through the contraction.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, they reincarnate, I think, in that contracted energy and it becomes a loop that becomes hard to get out of. <span>&nbsp;</span>To me, one way of dealing with that – you could say, “I’m leaving this person” – but, who is to say you’re going to find a person who is expansive.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you want to find something expansive you have live an expansive life because you attract to you what you’re living.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One thing is that you can do expansive work and don’t look for that reflection in your relationship.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have it compartmentalized so it is what it is, and be able to love that person in the way they need to be loved – that’s the key.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can’t have any relationship if you’re not willing to love someone in the way they need to be loved.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you can’t do that, then it’s not a good relationship at all – regardless of expansion and contraction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">That’s why you may have to contract to love them the way they need to be loved.<span>&nbsp; </span>So you need to create another way to match your expanded matrix to keep it alive, otherwise it gets lost.<span>&nbsp; </span>It can be in a spiritual group, it could be a church, it could be the meetings we do, it can be some kind of service – but, something so you don’t get stuck in that contraction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">If you try to explain this to the person you are with, they’re never going to understand it and they’re going to feel hurt, because it sounds to them like you’re being better than them just to preach it.<span>&nbsp; </span>So you have operate on all of this, making your decisions unto yourself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We have a couple of questions tonight about that kind of thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Are you ready, Terry?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, two of us that are never ready, but we show up.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m going to tell you guys something that I’ve learned is one of the greatest things – let me get this in words.<span>&nbsp; </span>People wait until they’re ready and then they do something, then they never do it because they’re never ready.<span>&nbsp; </span>Terry and I are never ready, but we do it – we show up.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s a great key there because people think that higher consciousness is going to descend on them and they’re going to float around with a thousand petals of a lotus because they’ve read that and they’re going to shift by some magical method.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I used to think this:<span>&nbsp; </span>then you would walk around and you’d be enlightened and wherever you would go, God would be with you and everything would be hunky-dory.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not been my experience that it works that way; what seems to work for me is that I show up.<span>&nbsp; </span>I open my mouth; I don’t know what’s going to come out.<span>&nbsp; </span>It took me a while to get the courage to do that, to say “Umm, it sounded good.”<span>&nbsp; </span>People liked me; they didn’t throw tomatoes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It took me a while to keep doing that and then to realize that the way it works is a group energy attracts the higher frequencies; everything from sex to being on the phone line, to however else to bring in really high group energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s always like amalgamating energies together that keep building upwards.<span>&nbsp; </span>As you do this enough, you seem to be a lot happier and then everyone looks at you and they think you’re enlightened.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s just an illusion; you just learned how to dance on group energies and hold group energies together no matter where you are; whether it’s with your wife, your partner, your job, your city.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s how, in my opinion, you get to those places.<span>&nbsp; </span>You walk into the space…</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you.<span>&nbsp; </span>We start from the beginning of your question.<span>&nbsp; </span>When an individual connects with the higher realms, they connect with a soul source and the soul source has a soul energy with the Elohim group, us, we have a soul energy that is extremely high in frequency with other energies, they have their own soul source energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>One can learn to identify the energy; Ra has its own soul source energy that is the group comes through as a lower frequency as it has mixtures of energies that they have picked up from their life in the third density.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We, the Elohim, do not have the lower frequencies as we have not lived in the lower realms enough to pick up those low energies of the lower realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each group or entity has its own mixture of frequencies that they have grounded within their passage in the physical universe.<span>&nbsp; </span>Spirit from outside the realm, has no footprint. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So one can identify what they are connecting with by recognizing the frequency.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is much as your dial on the radio has 640 labeled on it, or 780.<span>&nbsp; </span>When we connect, we are apparent which you can get to recognize the soul frequency.<span>&nbsp; </span>It comes across as the unique frequency that one, by using the extra-sensory muscles surrounding, and a part of them, which they reach out to other things in the universe with – by using these perceptions to sense the energy and know that it is true and correct and is resonating.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">If the signal, the thought, is coming from oneself, one can determine that if has a location within one’s greater aura.<span>&nbsp; </span>One can learn to observe and be sensitive to the location of the thought, as a thought comes into the manifest realm, it resonates the area around it and one can see if it is coming from one’s own matrix what area within their greater expanded aura that it is coming from.<span>&nbsp; </span>When thoughts are coming from one’s own self, they are to be observed but not to be taken as truth, as there are more than one source within one’s own matrix of thoughts.<span>&nbsp; </span>They may be brought forth from a past experience or from a future experience or from a concentrated energy of one’s path through one’s life that is played back to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It could be also a circuit; a circuit can be set up by something a parent has said in the past:<span>&nbsp; </span>“You’d lose your head if it wasn’t attached” might be such a circuit that one’s mother may have said.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, in a similar circumstance, they hear the voice, and these are circuitries that are set up and played according to the circumstances.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both these can be observed but not taken as literal.<span>&nbsp; </span>So many thoughts that one has in their expanded matrix it does well to not take them literally as they are playbacks; as they are a gleaning of something that has been brought in from another source, that is not even necessarily true.<span>&nbsp; </span>There can be circuitry from past lives brought in that is not correct.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One of the things that tends to play are terms, concepts and opposite concepts--so that one can be buffeted around by such things.<span>&nbsp; </span>If one thinks “I’m going to create a beautiful painting” then the opposite may come blasting through the mind, “I’m going to destroy a beautiful painting.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, the person is stymied; it’s like “I must not be a very good person to have that coming up” but, it does not reflect upon your worth at all.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is something that is wafting through your mind; it may be something from the past, it may be something that the neighbor across the street keeps yelling at the wall and it’s permeating the neighborhood.<span>&nbsp; </span>It may be something that a neighbor, or someone that lived in your house in the past, was yelling to the husband and it’s caught in the walls.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So one needs to resonate; if one is going to resonate with one’s thoughts, then they need to observe them and see how true they are for you.<span>&nbsp; </span>So in determining what path you are going to take, you need to observe and eliminate all of the chaff and isolate out what you really, truly resonate <span>&nbsp;</span>(with)– what opens your heart?<span>&nbsp; </span>What delights you?<span>&nbsp; </span>What makes you feel good?<span>&nbsp; </span>What makes you feel worthwhile?<span>&nbsp; </span>Even if you feel it for just a glimmer, an instant – you felt it and it something to build upon.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We look at individuals as energy bodies, and we as the Elohim do not look into the lower aspects of sexuality with judgment, as we look at it as, “What will expand the person, and what will further the person’s growth with a relationship that is sacred.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">How did someone get to be homosexual?<span>&nbsp; </span>They may have had a successful life, a past life as a member of the opposite sex and then be born into the new – like, if they were a male they might be born into female and may have been really comfortable with being a male.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, as the female they do not have the comfort and they may seek to take refuge in their earlier role.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are more genders than one can be aware of in general, as there are many individuals born with elements in their body of either both sex or a – we do not know the words here; the channel does not know the words – transgender that the doctors at birth may have changed some of the appendages when there one too many or there is a change that would bring the baby into life as one or the other, instead of having elements of both.<span>&nbsp; </span>This happens more than is talked about.<span>&nbsp; </span>This, then, in the individual as they grow may affect their relationships and their growth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Another example:<span>&nbsp; </span>one may have had a difficult relationship with one parent, and so moved toward having a relationship, a successful relationship, with the other parent who may have been the same sex.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are many different reasons for this as individuals seek to work through their issues.<span>&nbsp; </span>One may be rebelling authority of the society dictating a man and a woman relationship, and they may express their rebellion to authority by having the same-sex partner.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are different roots to get to be expressing oneself as a homosexual.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">An individual is present in the now and is creating their future at the same time.<span>&nbsp; </span>If they are headed within this creation of pictures – flick, flick, flick, flick – towards resentment, say, at a family member who has treated them harshly and they are locked up in their emotions, frozen in their emotions because they have not been allowed to expand and to express themselves and to come out and flow and open their heart, but have been shoved back into a contraction and feel they have been treated unjustly and they are frozen, then they carry that – flick, flick, flick, flick – picture to picture, they carry that into their future.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This lock-up of flow does not allow their body; it locks up the chemicals of their body.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their body can’t release proper chemicals and they then cannot get the proper flow of the lymph and they have stuck points.<span>&nbsp; </span>They can then, very well, get cancer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, this is part of the future that is laid in – flick, flick, flick, flick – one can change their future; one is not destined to have the same future if they really wish to change it, they can change it.<span>&nbsp; </span>As there is free will.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, if they do not move to change it, then one can see what their future will be, as it progresses and it is laid out in a series of projections in this illusion of all that is.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We leave the Nefertiti case aside, as we do not wish to move into this soul stream’s personal business.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, each person is a part of a soul stream.<span>&nbsp; </span>There can be fragments that join; we do not even wish to call them fragments, but other entities that borrow the stream of energy and move in to move along and learn from the flow of energy with the major soul stream and such entities can grow and learn and leave.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such entities can express addiction or can express other aberrations or other difficulties that affect the soul stream.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, when one is experiencing something they need to observe and see exactly what the components are.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">What is the method Jesus healed?<span>&nbsp; </span>For instance, did he go up to a high vibration within and become one with all that is and then face the person and act as a bridge to be his consciousness between divine infinite and the finite person before him?<span>&nbsp; </span>I have read Jesus. <span>&nbsp;</span>His method has been lost or hidden; but, I know nothing is hidden.<span>&nbsp; </span>All is simply vibration and resides in different frequencies.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please share the frequency as so many are open and asking.</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As Jesus was one with the Trinity; and as such, Jesus was not linearly making things a part of his own matrix and then confronting the person with it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jesus was non-linearly being the Christ Consciousness, the larger All That Is Father, and the son which was himself.<span>&nbsp; </span>As such, he had multiple focal points which are and were brought to bear upon the individual that was being confronted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So, if you move out of the sphere of Jesus himself into non-linearly being the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, then you have a whole multidimensional look at how Jesus could not only translate for the individual, but be the individual, and, as such, know all about him and his own matrix, and bring him into the greater vestige of All That Is, and therefore also bring help to him from whatever vantage point was available, or had the wherewithal to bring help to the individual<b>.</b></span></p>
