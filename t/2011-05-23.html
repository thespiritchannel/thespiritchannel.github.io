<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">This is May 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2011 and this Wynn in Sedona and Terry in Phoenix. This is our Monday night conference call. We have an interesting topic, but the real topic is going to be far more deep than the topic I announced. I think the topic was “One Size Doesn’t Fit All.” But, ever since I sent that out, I’ve been thinking about it and I was thinking that maybe one size does fit all; and, how does that work? What I was thinking when I put that idea out for a topic is how individual we all are. That we are looking for simple things - and you know what? If there was a simple thing that one person could say “Do this, think that, believe this”, our world wouldn’t be in a quandary now, because everyone would have done it already. Even the best of the best have failed to create something so simple that everyone could apply it and shift. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Of course, as we’re learning on our calls, each of us has a very unique energy signature. And each of us – okay, let’s just take a look at one point: Somewhere in the universe right now, at this moment there is a core of energy and that core of energy spreads out into the entire universe. The universe is made of that energy and somewhere at the core of energy which we call the center of the universe, exists an intelligence or a group of intelligence, that have called themselves the Elohim. They are able to manifest to us, to go through all those fields to get here and talk through Terry; not only talk through Terry but to come in as an energy that we all feel. Each of us started at that core of the universe sometime in the distant past – came in and took a body, or the energy formed around the body. You know, there is one question we asked that I thought was extremely fascinating which was “How does a soul get attached to a body?” Well, they said it started with the DNA, and then the DNA would pull in the soul or would create an energy around it that would come and differentiate itself. That’s a very interesting idea and of course in this kind of information I never say anybody, they should believe it because I can’t even prove that. But, it’s a very interesting concept: that, if you create a certain form of DNA, the DNA then pulls in the energy and forms it around the DNA so that it has a unique, individual energy signature. Prior to that, there was no individuated energy. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">So, this is an interesting idea about cloning – if somebody clones themselves and they make an exact DNA copy of themselves - then what would happen to the energy that gets pulled into that clone? Is it the same soul as the original person? Is it a duplicate of that soul? Is it very similar? Does it have the memories immediately? I think I’ll ask that question; although, we’re not into cloning (but) just to understand the nature of life, of how that works. In any case, when we started out we were kind of fairly innocent and pure in one respect, but not necessarily very evolved – innocent and simple. Then, over many, many eons of lifetimes we started to keep re-forming and re-creating that signature that was us, that energy signature, which some people call a soul – to the present time, when we have, each of us, a very complex energy signature. We sit here in our bodies and in our conscious minds and we want things to change and get different and we say “How do we do that?” Obviously, there are going to be certain techniques, which our energy signature, our very unique way of being, is going to respond to a certain thing where someone else would respond to something completely different. The system of yoga in India actually takes this into consideration. They have – I’m not going to remember them all – but they have four or five different kinds of yoga; and they say depending upon a person’s nature that they would gravitate to one yoga or another. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">For example, there is Bkati Yoga. ‘Bkati’ is devotion. So, those people that love to pray, go to church, have a woman who is devoted to her man… there is a quality of devotion that a whole yoga is formed around. All the exercises in that particular yoga are going to connect with devotion. Then there is another kind of yoga – let me see if I remember the name – it might be called Jnana Yoga, I’m not sure. But, it’s the yoga of wisdom and it has to do with learning the deep understandings of the way things work and to appeal to a person whose nature is looking for wisdom. Of course, the most popular form of yoga is Hatha Yoga, and Hatha Yoga has to do with the physical body moving into different postures. That’s the one that most people go to when they attend the local yoga classes – Hatha Yoga. I think there is more yoga(s) than that. It doesn’t mean that you’re just one or the other; I mean obviously you can be devotional and wise at the same time and you can have a physical body so you can do Hatha Yoga, but it’s “Where is the leaning for you?” It has to do with your entire track and all the energy signatures that you’ve picked up from the beginning of your individuation. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Each of us, in some degree, for our physical learning process in this realm, has to find those techniques, those paths that resonate with them, that are unique to them. Some people are vegetarians, some people love lots of meat. Some people are celibate, some people are sex maniacs, some people are this, that, the other thing. There are all these different natures that people have and probably Shakespeare, I think it was Shakespeare, that said “To thine own self be true.” Ultimately, only you can figure out your nature and what works for you. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Now I’m going to go into – this is where this gets really interesting – I’m going to go into a look at something that I was intuiting, because our groups always refer to ‘The Law of One.’ What happens in the Law of One? How does ‘oneness’ reconcile itself with individuality? How does that work? Now here is where I’m going to go off and speculate, then when we talk to our sources through Terry I’m going to get some clarification on my speculation. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Many people that are involved in spiritual groups today, spiritual awareness, talk about something called the ‘quantum field’, or ‘zero point energy’. There’s a physics principle, I believe it’s called the Heisenberg Principle, that discusses the wave/particle idea of matter. Let’s see if I get this correct. I didn’t study this exactly before this talk, so I hope I don’t make any gross mistakes in my physics. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">At the smallest piece of matter, there are certain experiments where it behaves like a solid and other experiments that it behaves like a wave. It’s a particle then it’s a wave. For a long time, this stumped scientists. How could it be a particle, and how could it be a wave? The idea is that it blinks back and forth; it keeps going from wave to particle and wave to particle. When it needs to be a wave, the wave side of it will work on the measurements and when it needs to be a particle, the particle side will work. This is a very interesting concept, because if we apply this to our consciousness which is what we’re going to do today – we’re going to apply it to our consciousness – what if our consciousness was a wave and a particle? What if all of us were blinking on and off, all the time? And, when we’re on we’re in the physical world particle and when we’re off, we’re in the wave world: metaphysical? For most of us, we miss the blinking. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">What I’m telling you is in no way truth. This is my putting stuff together and then we’re going to ask about it and see what they say, if I’m on the right track. If you look at a picture in a magazine, you will know that there are what is called little dots and there are so many dots that they form a picture and you don’t realize they’re dots. It’s the same thing with the television screen – they’re lines. There are so many lines that we don’t realize they’re lines, we see pictures. I’m going to propose that physical reality is similar in that we blink on and off, on and off, on and off – and, our consciousness pulls in all the places where we’re on and it looks like a continuum. But, it’s not really a continuum, it’s a blinking. When we’re in the particle phase, we are in a universe where everything is constructed and solid and ‘real’ so to speak. But, when we blink off we are in our non-physical existence. In the blink-off there’s no space or time, we disappear into nothingness just as if you took a picture in a newspaper, and instead of looking at all the dots you looked at all the spaces in-between the dots you’d have a blank picture, okay? Both exist, but we tend to flow it all together so that we only see what’s solid. My theory is, in that blink-off we are in the oneness, we are in the place of original creation, we are in the place of our sources – there is no separation, it’s all connected. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Sometimes when we talk, I suddenly stop talking and I say “Can you feel the space?” Now - in my theory here we are in the quantum space, and when we want to shift our lives all we need to do is blink into that space and insert some intentions and then the physical universe, the blink-on, starts to recreate. Now, that’s my theory – that’s how it feels when I think about it. That’s a very different way of looking at our sources, because oftentimes when we visualize the center of the universe we have something which is very far away. We know there are galaxies and galaxies and galaxies and planets and light years, etc. But, what if on the blink-off there was no distance and no time? Feel the energy when I stop talking. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">So - the question is: If that’s true, how do we move into the blink-off and insert a re-creative energy so when we blink on something shifted for the better. I’m telling you a theory; there is no way to prove it. But, we are going to bring in our sources and question them about this, because if I’m correct we’re on the edge of a technique that can be applied to everyone’s life to bring in the things they want. Is it different from calling in the light? I don’t think so. When we’re calling in the light and we do “Father Mother God” we’re expanding through the entire – in our invocation anyway – physical universe and bringing energy in from the center of the universe. That’s what we say. What if what we are really doing is moving into the place where we’re blinked off, and there is no time or space and we’re coming close to anything and everything we think about and intend, because we’re on the blink-off of the field? In that space is where everything starts. I don’t even know if this makes sense to you guys, but we’re going run it up the flag, and … Terry? Terry’s conscious mind – are you there?

Plus, when we meet everyone else in the nothingness and then we go into somethingness we carry a little bit of energy from everybody into it. I’ll tell you a story where I learned this. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">It was a couple of years ago and I had come to Sedona and I decided I was going to do a public talk and there was a little restaurant that had a free room that they would give me, their banquet room, to do a talk if people ate dinner. We did a talk, and then we took a dinner break and then I came back to talk again. That seems simple enough; but, what I found out was I made a terrible error in organizing my talk that way. What happened was – when I’m talking and when Terry’s channeling, we are in the midst of creating a group energy. Another way of putting it is: we are – it’s my theory here – is we are going into the wave part of consciousness where there is no existence. There’s nothingness. Those of you that are feeling the energy are coming into that with us – we’re going into it as a group. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">I’m kind of getting used to holding this energy. Terry is getting more used to it. Many times, people on this call or people that are hearing us for the first time are not used to it. What happened at this dinner is I created – when I say “I created”, I did not do it. I just showed up and talked. But, I experienced a group energy forming as I was talking. And then we ate dinner and when we stopped to eat dinner, the group energy totally fell apart. It was like I was in this energy that was being pulled apart, almost like (you know) how they take a body and if they’re going to pull a body apart they attach things to the arms and the legs and horses go each different way? That’s how it felt my energy field was; I was in the group energy and as soon as we ate dinner it was like it went back to the individual energies: “How are you doing?” “What’s going on?” “We really liked that” - and everyone was engaged in an energy of separation, not terrible separation, about like “Oh, let’s get to know these people. We live in the same town.” I’m sitting there, and as that separation occurred I was in the middle of it and I started getting headaches; I started getting nauseous. I was sitting there, I couldn’t eat my dinner. I told everybody “Excuse me, I’m going to have to leave.” I went out and sat on my car until everybody finished dinner. I came back and I was still separated. I was still like fragmented, and I had a huge, throbbing headache and I tried really hard and I pulled it together and I got the group energy to come back in, but I still had the headache for the rest of the evening. </span></span></p>

When the call ends there’s a certain rehabilitation time so that we come back to ourselves. It’s probably true for some of you as you get used to holding these frequencies. When the calls ends you feel the frequencies on the call and you now have to go back and you’re dealing with yourself as a father, or a husband, or a wife, or going to work. Each moment, the deal is, even though we may be moving into this quantum field on this call, when the call is over it’s a new moment. Can you step into the next moment and recreate being in the space of that moment? </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;" face="Times New Roman, serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="4">Oftentimes, people don’t learn how to do that quickly, and so when they look back at this and say “Well, that was awesome” or “That was great” or they’ll put me on a pedestal and it’s not me. You’re doing it; except, I’ve learned to be in the space. It’s not a linear process; I don’t know how to tell you how to do that, other than share my experiences and you have to pick it up and take it home and do it yourself. The idea of being in the space instead of in the solid part, and seeing your life as a blinking consciousness that’s moving from solid to ‘field’ or wave, and start looking for the wave and then you move into that place of recreation in not only your life but the physical universe you live in. Now I’ll shut up and what time is it? It’s 6:42 – luckily we can go over so people won’t be too mad at me, and we will talk about… there is some possibility I might go off when I put this power cord in and I want to put it in before I start so I don’t get desperate. </span></span></p>

It is very slow in the third dimension and from the higher realms one can move into an area of no time. This gives them a jump off place to move from any position to any position. So, when you say that we move from the center of the universe, through the galaxies, through the solar system, we are born of non-linear and we cannot move through space, locations, time but we can simply be there non-linearly; so, in the area of no time what you say one enters at a state blink-off. In this area there is no time, no space, no ego, no pride. This gives you some clues as to how you can translate into no time, and it is easy to do or hard to do depending upon the baggage you carry with you. Do you have questions? Are you on the line?</span></span></p>

There would be a beginning of physicality. We know in physics that when waves intersect you get harmonics. In physics, we get a new frequency – two new frequencies at least – that are different from the frequencies of the original waves. You get the two frequencies added together and you get the two frequencies subtracted, which are called harmonics. How did this principle engage itself in this aspect of the beginning of creation, if it did?</span></span></p>

I just have to go on faith that it works that way that when frequencies came together there was something unique in the properties that created persistence or solidification as a result of the frequencies coming together. Of course, all frequencies, all waves – if they’re sine waves (I don’t know if you guys know what a sine wave is, but a frequency is something that goes on and off, on and off – boom boom boom boom boom). A square would indicate that when it came on it came on it came on at full amplitude and when it turned off it would be zero. So, it would be like turning a light switch on and off, on and off so many times per second. </span></span></p>

Of course, when I say “slowly” when we’re talking about high frequencies, it’s very fast. But, if you looked at it, and you could see the wave, you could see it didn’t just come on and then go off - it would go off slowly. Were the frequencies of the original creation, were they sine waves?</span></span></p>

This interference created a little time delay in the motion, and thus time was born. The blinking, the spinningness, also created time in the spinning, but when the two intersected it created an interference pattern which was a slower time. Now one could graph that and the resulting graph could be a short, sensitive so quick, a short square wave, but not a typical square wave; but, not a sine wave. Does this make more sense?</span></span></p>

When two people gather together with a common purpose and a high intention, I believe there is a predisposition for both of them to help lift each other’s consciousness due the space where it’s harder for them to do it individually, which is why I do Team Shift calls, why we do group calls. Because, if we could do it individually I would just say “Okay guys, I’m here, here’s what I pray for the highest good.” But I can’t do that myself; it needs a group down here. In a certain way, when a group comes together are we all projecting energies out that create interference patterns that start potential for recreation of physical manifestations?</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Channeled information is not meant to be believed blindly. Sometimes information may bleed through from the conscious mind of the channel. It is possible that a negative Source may interfere. Apply your own discernment, take only what resonates and discard the rest. An answer to a question is meant for the person asking the question and you have the privilege of listening in because sometimes you can gain insights from the answer. However,<span>&nbsp; </span>even though the circumstances may be similar, do not merely assume the answer applies to you.. This is not meant to replace seeing your doctor, dentist or any alternative practitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some people get healings here, so you can be open to it.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
