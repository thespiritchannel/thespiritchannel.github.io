<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Terry:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Right. I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have to<b><span style="color: red;"> </span></b>get<b><span style="color: red;"> </span></b>ready to get out of the way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The truth of the matter is… we are never ready, OK?<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re just good actors.<span>&nbsp; </span>We show up and they show up. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Alright…we have some really good questions today.<span>&nbsp; </span>The first question…I didn’t write the person’s name down.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Now, I want to tell you, those of you who are listening on the replays, sometimes people ask health questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>At one point I did not ever want to answer a health question.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s a certain vulnerability.<span>&nbsp; </span>First of all, we’re not allowed to be doctors.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’re not allowed to tell people what to do.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I made a lot of disclaimers.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wanted to remind everybody of those disclaimers that if we talk about health, it is for entertainment purposes only.<span>&nbsp; </span>Check with your doctor and verify anything we say.<span>&nbsp; </span>The other thing is, if you want to ask a health question ~ if you want to come on here and ask a health question, the chances are greatly increased of me asking it if you become a regular because at least I know that you take what I’m doing seriously and that I have a sense that you understand the rules. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><br /> Because if somebody comes on to this call one time, and then they make this huge request, “Ra’An do this, Ra’An do that.” Now I’m not saying it won’t happen but I’ve noticed the people that make a connection with the energy have the strongest chance of having something happen.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re just kind of coming on one time because that moment in your life happens to be falling apart in a drastic way and then you’re never on again, you may not get results.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is about an inner action, a co-creative energetic inner action between realms, between us and them.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The way it works is start envisioning them as friends, not magic hocus pocus guys to do things ~ but as friends.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you want them to be your friend, one of the things is, to be worthy of that kind of a friend.<span>&nbsp; </span>What is worthiness?<span>&nbsp; </span>It means, be honest, be caring.<span>&nbsp; </span>Follow the precepts of the Law of One, we could say, of seeing people as yourself.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don’t hurt people.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do the human side as best as you can and that makes you worthy ~ being worthy means that you open up your own space so they can come into it, because if your space is filled with guilt, if your space is filled with anger, if your space is filled with resentment, how is the energy of another dimension going to connect with you?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Probably the best space is emptiness, neutrality ~ total neutrality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now things can show up and you’ll recognize them.<span>&nbsp; </span>No psychic pressure, just neutral.<span>&nbsp; </span>I show up on these calls neutral to the best of my ability and I’m always surprised.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not always, I’m kind of used to it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Presently it’s always…how can I say it…? I would say a couple hours before the call; like Terry and I were saying ~ we’re just humans here, just more bozos on the bus like you.<span>&nbsp; </span>On one hand we’re humans and on the other hand we’ve learned to get out of the way and leave the space for this energy to flow in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When we schedule ourselves for these calls, it’s so amazing that no matter how we’re feeling, they show up.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe some of you are noticing the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Now take a moment…take a moment and shut your eyes………………….and feel the energy….flowing in…to your crown chakra……………………………………………... </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Now if you’re not feeling it, that’s OK.<span>&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t mean you’re no good.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it takes practice ~ sometimes it takes repetition.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it takes clearing a certain pattern in yourself so the space becomes open.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be patient, don’t judge yourself.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are feeling it, congratulate yourself for developing the worthiness to have this experience.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Alright… now I have one person who asked a question here, and I don’t have their name.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s a personal question.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let me see if I can find it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here it is. There’s her name.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When people ask a personal question, they should always put their city in.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems that …I don’t know if they have as easy a time locating you if your city’s not there…alright?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The mystery schools were started after the introduction of the Ra material into Egypt and it contained, not only information from the Ra group, but it contained the remnants of information that was passed down earlier within the priesthood and the individuals within the schools felt that this information needed to be guarded as it could be misused by the general public at large.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, they felt that it could help them keep control over the general public at large and they felt very possessive of the information that they had written on the scrolls and then would teach to individuals. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So the people in there were not necessarily service to others because many of the individuals moving into the mystery schools were very interested in the different (higher) density information and were very interested in learning about their mystical life.<span>&nbsp; </span>They brought an intense interest in there, many that went into it.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, many that were in the management of the mystery schools kept the mystery schools in the service-to-self mode to be a tool for the priesthood and a reservoir of powerful information that they could draw on to help keep control over the populace. </span></p>

In the area of the bowel; there is a lack of probiotic, good bacteria.<span>&nbsp; </span>When one now--in the area you are in--eats certain foods ~ for instance, one of them being corn, one of them being corn syrup which is in many substances if you look on the label.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Corn is…along with soy, largely, genetically engineered modified food.<span>&nbsp; </span>Wherein, they use corn seed that is modified to carry a gene of a pesticide and an herbicide.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pesticides are to kill insects. Herbicides are to kill weeds.<span>&nbsp; </span>These substances kill off bacteria, beneficial bacteria.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When one eats corn chips from the wrong source and when one eats many of the products which are manufactured with corn syrup.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The genetically modified corn, with genetics of pesticides and herbicides, gets into the intestinal tract it changes the whole culture within the bowel which then gives an individual many problems and problems with digestion. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are substances one can take to reestablish the proper culture within the colon.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of these is Kefir from an organic source.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are probiotics which Dr. Marshall sells which one can take in a capsule form.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is acidophilus and substances such as acidophilus in the health food store that one can buy and take one in a small container a day. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Also, proper omega oils make a difference in the functioning of the intestinal tract.<span>&nbsp; </span>Much like when your car is lubricated, it runs well.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your body needs to be lubricated and among what needs to be lubricated, one of the main things is the digestive tract.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are enzymes that Dr. Marshall sells that can be used to enhance the digestion of your food.<span>&nbsp; </span>As when the food is properly digested, then it goes into the intestinal tract and it does not create a problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nutrients are further digested while the nutrients are in the digestive tract. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The bowel has an area within it for manufacture of B vitamins.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the bowel is properly cared for, it enhances and nurtures the body.<span>&nbsp; </span>When it gets impacted with old matter then it makes it hard for the interchange of materials in and out of the bowel. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Another thing is water.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having enough balanced pH water to drink as this water will help within the digestive tract.<span>&nbsp; </span>When one doesn’t have enough water, then the water is withdrawn from the bowel and leaves the bowel in a constipated state.<span>&nbsp; </span>We suggest attention be given to these matters. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You could even a get a free consultation by calling up someone at </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Marshall</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">’s office, (310) 320-1132 and asking to speak to somebody about all of the things one can do to create a very good environment in the bowel. They also have some other products that are very good for the bowel.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you very much.<span>&nbsp; </span>If anyone’s listening for the first time, when Terry recommends Dr. Marshall, it’s probably a….I’ve never completely asked because it happens to be her favorite person that she’s checked out that’s very good so it’s kind of a blending of her consciousness there that’s bringing that through.<span>&nbsp; </span>We don’t have any professional or referral commission from Dr. Marshall.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s just her conscious(ness), herself. (She) has a lot of experience believing in his impact.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have had people, I’ve had people email me who had called him and had very successful results with whatever he told them.</span></p>
