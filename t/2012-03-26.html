<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What show did I meet you at?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I recently met you at the show in Palomar at the Big Windmill in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Carlsbad</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">California</span><b>.<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1;" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""></a><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote;"><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">[1]</span></b></span></span></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That was a long time ago.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was a while back<b>.</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They just had another one in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Carlsbad</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I said, “I wish I was there.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’re in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Arizona</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> now, so it’s harder to go that far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you so much for coming. Have you paid any attention to our work, the stuff we’re doing?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve been very disconnected for a while. I’m kind of doing the hermit thing both here and on the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">island</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Hawaii</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> since the last time I saw you, so I’ve not really kept in touch.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Every Monday night we do this Conference Call.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Each one is different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Our normal Monday nights – each one is a special thing so it’s never quite normal – oftentimes we do a live channeling session.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We ask questions and Terry answers the questions. We pick a topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Once a month, Carla Rueckert is our guest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">For those of you who are tuning in and listening who are not aware of Carla, Carla was one of the people to whom I would give credit for inspiring me at the very beginning of the time I started writing the book about David Wilcock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She is a channel –using the word channel to mean a person who brings through messages from other realms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She’s quite extraordinary, quite different from most other people that do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She’s most well-known for something called <i>The Ra Material</i>, which she did in 1981 [through 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This was the first time this Ra group had picked someone to speak through in a very long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They were willing to talk through Carla because they believed in her high intent and her groups’ high intent to keep this at a very high level.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In short, [the Ra group] identified themselves as a group soul that was made up of people that graduated; of beings, entities, that graduated the physical universe of the third density, and then acted as helpers and guides for those planetary populations still stuck in 3D, like us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Throughout history they have done different interventions that usually ended up in some big transformation at this level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Carla was their current emissary. She still is, without going into long explanations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">If any of that sounds intriguing to any of you, Carla has a website – www.llresearch.org – she has a community – www.bring4th.org.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She’s got ongoing support, not so different from the way we provide ongoing support, different because she does it in her way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Many people around the world have been greatly inspired, enlightened and influenced by the materials she’s brought through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Many of her books are available on her website for free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you’ve never checked it out, there are probably thousands of transmissions that are transcribed up there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Close to two thousand<b>.</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Close to two thousand, plus a bunch of books – <i>The Channeling Handbook,</i> <i>The Ra Material</i> books – what else?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><i>Secrets of the UFO</i> – is that up there?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s up there. You can order the coloring book we did for children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s a nice round of things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For instance, I think we may be one of the few metaphysical groups that I know who has anything for children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In this case, somebody brought a child to a channeling session and the child asked a question of Hatonn. The answer [Hatonn gave to that child was perfect for making a coloring book.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We have a lady that draws cartoons for government textbooks that was a member of our meditation group and she was glad to help us out. [Our coloring book] is called <i>What is Love.</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’re recording this; we do that because we mail these all out and we have maybe a thousand people who are getting these recordings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I still have Alzheimer’s so my producer</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">always has to tell me, “Wynn, turn the tape recorder on.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Having Alzheimer’s, it’s called – some people call it “Ascension Alzheimer’s”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As you get more into spirit, it’s pretty easy to forget things down here.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Did you ever notice that, when people are getting really old and they know their time is getting short, they start worrying much less about the physical universe and they just seem spaced out, non-threatening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They’re not competitive and they’re easy to be around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They can’t remember things, because part of their energy is already in other realms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>To do this job, the job we do, part of our energy has to be in other realms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s an interesting phenomenon, because as you start moving into other realms all the things that I want to accomplish - I’m still in an accomplishment stage – there isn’t that angst about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You just do it because you feel, “This will help people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We should do this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is going to be of service.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m not doing it because I need to be at the top of some recognition heap, like, “Everybody lookin’ at me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Look at this.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t matter anymore. I just do it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Sometimes when you’re at the place of looking at the things you want to accomplish, accomplishment in 3D looks like recognition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Accomplishment in 4D and 5D looks like service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s the really big thing to integrate, that little fact right there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When you can do accomplishment out of service, you know you have come to a new plateau.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Carla, is there anything you want to say?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I always have to talk at the beginning, because as soon as I turn it over to Carla, I can just kind of relax for about a half hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then, I have to tell her, “Be quiet! Let Terry say something.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Carla doesn’t do that because she’s attached to attention. If she was attached to attention she would be getting mad at me for saying that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She just starts talking and she gets into a flow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One thing leads to the next to the next and I can feel the energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I always learn things from her, so it’s always great to have her on the program. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Moving on…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The topic tonight that I announced, Carla is “The Simple Things.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m making sure I get this out before I let you talk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We try to be on topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When we start getting into all this esoteric knowledge, all this grand understanding of how the universe works – I used to be this way some years ago – we start to think we are in a special, elite group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The whole thing is not about being elite. Nonetheless, it’s human nature to say, “Nobody around me knows this.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We look at the people around us and we can’t talk to them about all this sophisticated stuff, we start to think we’re better than they are. Yet it’s those very people around us that are giving us our opportunity to be of service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s an interesting thing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Terry and I did a reading for someone recently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m not going to say her name, and I’m not going to say anything that will give her away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There was a really great principle that came across in that reading.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This person had a partner and she felt that the partner didn’t understand any of this esoteric stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She felt separated from him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They were wondering, “Should we stay together or leave?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I thought the counsel for this was profound. She was supposed to learn how to love this person as he was and make him feel safe and make him feel secure, that she wasn’t going to leave him at any moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Through doing that, the nature of the relationship would shift.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Her mate felt really insecure because his wife was into all this esoteric stuff that he didn’t understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was very profound; a very profound answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s one that I can certainly relate to at different times in my life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When I took that very pose where I felt superior to other people because of things I knew – advanced wisdom, advanced esoteric knowledge –they didn’t know that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was not about them having to know that for me to feel connected to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I find just because somebody knows all of that stuff it doesn’t mean I feel more connected to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Even right now, both of us having the same viewpoints of the universe is not what makes me feel connected to somebody, although it can help in working out a personal issue. You can have some interesting discussions about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But that’s not the same as feeling compassion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">On that note, I’m turning it over to Carla and letting her take the stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Go ahead, Carla.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All right, Wynn – thanks<b>.</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Gijs</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Wynn, do you want to mute the lines?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn: Y</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">es.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think Wynn has such a good point in that it is the big things that make the news but it is the little things that count. In a relationship, in real life - in life the size that we all live it – it’s the person that turns back to give a nod or a smile, that remembers to pray for you when you’re sick instead of just giving a passing thought to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There are so many ways that indicate how you feel with reference to the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the Law of One material and The Confederation material in general is going to tell you that you’re here to serve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You’re here to serve the Creator in everyone that you see and in every situation that you meet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">People can interpret that in two ways, and that’s why there are two polarities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>People can interpret that by meaning that we’re here to serve people by influencing them with all of our wonderful wisdom and power – and that’s called the service-to-self polarity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So, we whip everybody into line, punish them if they don’t agree with us and reward them if they do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We have a universe that is as controlled as possible and we’re doing the very best we can to make a beautiful world in which everybody will be happy according to the way that we think that they should be happy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The other way, of course, is to view the world as a very powerful and sacred thing and yourself as a servant – and, that is the service-to-others approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can take that exact desire to serve the Creator in everyone into such a vast array of attitudes that it helps to be able to break it down and to [ask yourself,] “Is this for me, or is it for the other guy?<b>”</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Carla, I want to insert a point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Don’t lose your track.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Using that terminology of service to self and service to others, it can easily turn something into a doctrine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I watch people walking around, like, “You’re the devil”; “You’re service to others”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There is another way of looking at that distinction which I wanted to share which may help some people see it in a slightly different way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ll say it and you can contest what I’m saying.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Everybody needs attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When you’re in this realm, attention is one of the most wonderful things that you get.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s the way in which you get attention that has a great deal of bearing on [whether you are polarized] service to self or service to others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Service to self would mean, “Look at me, always look at me.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When somebody is looking at you; when you’re espousing great wisdom or great pontifications””, you’re getting energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Anyone who is standing in front of an audience, whether they’re negative or positive, if they’re working it correctly it’s getting energy from that group. Anyone who has a following is getting energy from their group.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The thing about it is, when there’s no co-creative energy, the energy doesn’t sustain just because somebody is paying attention to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It sustains for just so long, and then you have to go look for someone else, and then look for someone else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It starts to become really negative because you have to manipulate people and enslave them to try to squeeze more energy out of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You keep doin<b>g this</b>: getting energy, energy, energy – but it’s a never-ending kind of funnel of needing energy, in its worst case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s where you get all these terrible sacrifices and rituals – all done to get energy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">As you move just through the other side of that – because we all need energy – it becomes co-creative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You’re not just taking the position of, “Let me get energy from you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Give me energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am smarter than you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am your teacher.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You move into the space where the energy goes back and forth and no one knows what’s going to happen next, in which case the energy doesn’t die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You don’t have to keep looking for new people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You always find ways to keep the co-creation going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Now you can have committed relationships.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">You notice on these calls, this is ‘seat of the pants’ – it’s co-creative. Whatever we’re doing, whether it’s me and Terry or me and Carla, we’re bouncing energy back and forth between us. We could probably go for five hours and not run out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s because the service-to-others aspect has the advantage of not running out of energy, whereas the service-to-self [aspect] runs out of energy and always is acquisitive. [It is] always trying to acquire more energy and always trying to be the top dog, getting everything focused on them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Did you ever go to a group and have somebody that totally dominated the conversation?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It gets boring so fast when you have to sit through it, because they will not let go. They don’t even know they are dominating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They think they are God’s gift for sharing things with people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s one way that I have come to look at service to self/service to others. It’s not a matter of, “I’m one of the good guys: I’m service-to -others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’s one of the bad guys; he’s service-to-self.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The reason the person is service-to-self is because they never had that experience of co-creativity with someone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I won’t say that’s absolutely true. Maybe they have and they said, “I’d rather do it this way.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The Ra group says you can go to a very high level being service-to-self, but at a certain point, if you don’t switch you’re stuck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can’t go any higher. You’re at the pinnacle of all the power over this realm. You enslave everybody. You’re manipulating people. You’re predicting everything that’s going to happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You’re creating patterns that other people fall into and you’re stuck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It gets boring because you’re creating all the outcomes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Until we move into the place where you don’t know what’s going to happen next – I don’t know if that’s exactly the right way to say it - When we move into the place where there’s co-creation and we give people the space to be themselves and they’re not afraid of you and they can be themselves and you can be yourself, the energy moves to a new level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s where the Law of One comes in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Did that make sense? Back to you, Carla.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes – that made perfect sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What do you think, Terry?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Terry</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I totally agree with what you said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I do too, Wynn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The heart of it is that you release, within yourself, the attachment to how people see you or to how you see yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you see yourself as a person who is service-to-others then it doesn’t harm you to say, “I am a servant.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I start out each day praying to be a servant in my Father’s house and really, truly mean that – “May I please address every circumstance in the highest and best way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>May I not be caught by circumstances so that I lose my perspective and my compassion and my judgment?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It really helps to have that determination.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When you are of service to others; when you are wanting to love rather than be loved as St. Francis put it<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""></a><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote;"><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">[2]</span></span></span></span> – to be a support to others rather than be supported; to console rather than be consoled – [to do] all those beautiful things that you hope to do for other people, it takes a good deal of substantial, what my mother used to call “bottom.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It takes a lot of soundness, groundedness, to stay humble and to stay genuinely in that place where you know for sure that things are coming through you, not from you, [and that] you are well-cast in your role as servant. Your job is to get your mind and your heart empty so that you can receive what the Creator is giving you so that you can create the most beautiful possible day or best day or food if it’s something that you’re cooking, or the most beautifully painted bathroom or whatever it is that you are doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you’re empty like that then you are free to be taken by the highest and best of energies and to create the most helpful and the best feeling vibration to live in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Just think [how it would be] if all the people that you knew were really interested in creating that kind of atmosphere, even on a tiny scale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It [boggles] the mind as to how beautiful an experience it would make for everybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s the basic thing about the little things counting: what do you have but little things, really?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you don’t make those little things count, what does count?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s really important to honor your days; to pick out things that make days special.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The thought that occurred to me is – when you say things I hear contrary things in my mind; I’m just going to say my contrary things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The idea of humility I think can be interpreted or misinterpreted by some people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I misinterpreted it for a period of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I remember:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When I was younger, I used to look at Mohammed Ali and I said, “What an ego trip that guy is on!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m the greatest!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They’d never accuse Mohammed Ali of being humble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On the highest level, I don’t think he said those things out of the sense of ego.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think he was on a Divine Mission.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He was a performer<b>.</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He was a performer, right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And, he was on a mission, either consciously or unconsciously, to be a hero for black people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He succeeded beyond anyone’s wildest dreams, and he used that ability of this bravado in order to get the right attention so he could do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Underneath it, he is a humble person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When you use the word ‘humble’ and you try to apply that to people, it’s very much a trick to figure out, “Are they really</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">they doing that out of service or are they doing that out of ego?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s why Jesus said, “Judge not lest ye shall be judged.”<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""></a><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote;"><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">[3]</span></span></span></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You don’t have to worry about it. You just have to worry about yourself and figure out what you’re supposed to do and evaluate yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, even making the distinction between service to self and service to others, it pulls at you. It can easily tempt you to move into a judgmental thing, like, “This person is this, this person is that, this person is this; this person is a reptilian!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">On the simple things, I know myself, I’ve learned this:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>there are days where I feel funky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There are days where I look like a criminal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve learned to understand it. It’s kind of like I’m washing up all these old lifetimes, and on various days they show up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I look in the mirror and I say, “Uh oh, that’s one of those patterns coming up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have to shift myself.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">One of the things that I’ve learned as a way to shift myself is through the simplest acts of kindness, like calling up somebody that I haven’t talked to in a long time and saying “I just thought I’d check in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>How are you doing?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We start a conversation and five minutes into the conversation, all those patterns that were rising up in me go away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Yet, it’s so easy to forget how to do those things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you don’t do them - if I don’t shift myself,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I could look like a criminal for the entire day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In fact, I’d better not go out today. They might arrest me if they look at me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In a sense, you’re doing those things for other people but you’re also doing them for yourself, because the energy always comes back. And it shifts you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You have to learn to ride the energy of transformation that keeps you in a state of flow and keeps you in a state of movement. For me, if I don’t keep that kind of motion up, then I just withdraw.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I go into old patterns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I need to do that, I have too much energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The energy backs up on me if I don’t find a way to release it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Carla, I bet you never look like a criminal, do you?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Very few women as small as I look like a criminal. The summer I turned 19 I was let into the State Fair for under 10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am so innocent, although I can be devious,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m pretty much of a straight arrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I suppose that humility can be taken in that way of false humility. True humility is that emptying out that makes you ready to receive. I don’t really know any other way to be the servant of the Most High other than to empty the self and prepare for whatever I’m going to feel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, this is all on the inner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you’re telling somebody with whom you’re riding down to the office that you’re doing all this dramatic cleansing and emptying of self so that you can do the Creator’s work in your cubicle, they’re going to look at you and say, “My – you’re taking yourself seriously, aren’t you?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">And, all I can say is, “Yes I am.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is what I volunteered for.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I’m talking on this show and I’m empty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m not really talking.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have found with apologies, at those times when somebody really has done something to me, that they have really hurt themselves.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think a lot of people think that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When you say service-to-others, and then you say humble, people start thinking that I’m going to spend the day walking old ladies across the street and I’m going to give some money to a charity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Being service-to- others can have a warrior aspect to it. It doesn’t mean being a doormat, or small.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It can have a war[like aspect] to it; it can give passion to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It depends upon your own personal attributes and your way of expression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You have a natural way of expressing.

A lot of times, people like the feeling of love and they want to be totally loving and they don’t understand why they can’t just be totally loving.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I think that [in that] part of that is within their own selves, at some point, they felt like they were right and nobody would listen, nobody would give them any credit and then they just had to shut up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think communication is a big thing. People could start to alter their lives by writing down each day where there was a big change in their life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Like, where they weren’t allowed to say something or do something that they felt was very, very important – perhaps in their childhood – and they kind of hold that to themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It creates a blockage towards reaching out, and they then think everybody is going to be that way towards them like their parents were.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If they try to be totally loving and they still have these belief systems that were instilled in them when they were a child that it’s going to create conflict.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I think communication or genuineness and sitting down and writing down where the major changes in one’s life are, and what was going on at that time and just writing down your own point of view and how you were right at that time, then, eventually, you can let go of having to be right because you’ve expressed it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There’s also a little bit of angst that came about when one isn’t able to do what they feel is right.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Those are my comments<b>.</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There is a technique that you can use. My husband is very good at it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He used to teach it. You create a drama [out of] one of the situations Terry was talking about, and one of the roles is played by the self.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The other role is the person they had the trouble with, that they had the miscommunication with. For this Neuro-Linguistic Programming, you get out in front of the group. It’s all very done in a very intense group therapy atmosphere. But you don’t play yourself necessarily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You might play the boss or the mom or whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But, whoever plays what roles, you re-enact that role and this time you do the things you did not know how to do when you were a child. And you successfully – if the therapy is successful – defend yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That is supposed to be a tremendously healing thing<b>.</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think one of the greatest services that a person can do for another person is to be a little wise. You have to be able to look at this from afar in order to know what you’re doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, you probably won’t do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We always like being around cheery, uplifted, joyful people – we all do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It takes less energy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There are times when somebody is going through a Dark Night of the Soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You have to identify [whether they are having a Dark Night of the Soul, or [whether] they’re just an energy sucker.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When you hook into somebody who is going through really heavy, negative stuff – oftentimes, they’ll latch onto you and they’ll just keep draining your energy and it doesn’t go anywhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They don’t change, and they use you as a constant distraction because they’re in so much pain.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There is a point where someone is actually attempting to take responsibility for their stuff and their stuff starts coming up and it doesn’t look pretty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Most people back off from that because it’s so hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you find somebody like that in your life and you can hold [love] for them when they’re going through it, you can help them reach the other side of it. You have done a huge service for the universe because now you’ve been responsible for holding [love] so someone could have the courage to go through all that garbage that’s coming up and get to the other side of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Once they’re on the other side, there are huge amounts of gratitude that get exchanged, because on some level they know you did that for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then they learn how to do that for other people because it was done for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s one way to make a huge shift and change in your life, and in other people’s lives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I know there have been times where I’ve done that for people and I see how it works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I know that there are people who have done that for me and I see how it works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s not an easy thing, when you’re going through stuff like that, to [find] someone who can hold [love] for you, unless you’re lucky enough to be married to a very compassionate person. Then they’ll understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The thing is, when you’re [suffering], you don’t look good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When you don’t look good, people turn away from you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s very special when someone does not turn away from you when you don’t look good, and holds [the love]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>for you until you heal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Do you know the experience I’m talking about, Carla?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yeah, sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You speak about it very well, Wynn.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve been there and done that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think we all have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I know that you can be that place for other people; that lap that people can crawl into, that smile that people can snuggle into.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I get letters from all over the world all the time from people I’ve never met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I got a beautiful little dangly thing – it looks like the kind of thing you hang over the rearview mirror in your car - and she made it herself. She is a Buddhist nun in the far reaches of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">India</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">. She wanted to thank us for having the materials online where she could read them for free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s just like that all the time. There’s a bottomless well of gratitude right out on the waters?? It’s amazing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t come in ten-fold; it comes in a hundred-fold or a thousand-fold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m not saying this financially; I’m saying this in terms of the deep bottom of your heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can’t believe how warm it can grow because of the thank-yous that people will give you. And really all you were doing was trying to serve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s a crap-shoot. You never know whether you were able to serve or not; you’re just hoping that you can.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes when you do that gratitude comes back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, you fail.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You don’t fail; I call it getting a blessing.<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn5;" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""></a><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote;"><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">[5]</span></span></span></span> Those who are poorer because they are the children of God are [receiving] the benedictions; you get a benediction sometimes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You get to be those that are accursed for the spirit’s sake. So, when I get somebody that does me that way, I say, “Oh thank you.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">You can drive people crazy [doing that].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t have anybody in my life right now, but I used to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’d thank him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’d tell me how rotten I was and I’d thank him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He’d say, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>“Why are you thanking me?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And I’d reply, “Blessed are those that curse you.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I just got an email last week from somebody that I’ve known for years who decided I was evil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This was somebody who was going through really hard times. She’s probably going to listen to this so I’m not going to say her name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She was going through a very hard time for years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Somehow I gave her my phone number and she would call me every other day and oftentimes, she would complain about everybody and everyone with whom she was coming in contact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I kept telling her, “You’re not supposed to judge people. Go through your experiences and just dismiss them.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Everyone was cursing her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I knew eventually it would be my turn and it got to be my turn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was okay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s just how it works.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I think officially we need to end the show now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Since we can go a little longer, if you guys have the time, Carla and Terry, we could open up the lines and see if people have anything they want to share on the topics we’ve been talking about, or anything they want to ask anybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Would you guys like that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Is that okay?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Gijs, come up with a good question.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Gijs</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What I keep telling my children is to treat others the way you want to be treated.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Okay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Who said that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Jesus said “Love your neighbor as yourself.”<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn6;" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""></a><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote;"><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">[6]</span></span></span></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Didn’t he say that Carla?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Bible says that and most world religions have that precise sentiment:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Golden Rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s the basis of so much.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Anyone else have something they want to share?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Nimoway</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I guess I would put forth the idea that if we’re just simple then we just try and be the best that we can in all ways and not try to get real mental – either puff ourselves up or put ourselves down and sort of take the consequences sometimes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Things seem to be flowing and sometimes things don’t go over so well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>To me, it’s a centering to stay simple and not get too mental on it, just do the best you can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Like you said, do not be so judgmental. But if you find yourself there just kind of cool it down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s kind of like overdoing it on the understanding and on the intellectualizing about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I still feel motivated to be that kind of person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I guess that’s all I have to say, if that makes any sense here.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think, if anyone is interested, that here is a technique; something you can do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>when you wake up in the morning, say, “God, give me opportunities today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I will not miss any opportunity to make a difference in someone’s life by uplifting someone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If I don’t get any opportunities thrown at me, I’ll make some up.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Think of things that you wouldn’t have normally done and that you go out of your way to do that will change the vibration, the joy, the happiness of someone else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Do that every day for a week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’d be willing to bet you will feel different at the end of the week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Do it deliberately; don’t be passive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Say ,“I will not miss an opportunity.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I built that into my system and it’s like when I go out into the world, all these things come to me where I have something to contribute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t have to look for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some days I’m scared to go out of the house because I have all this stuff to do and one of those things will pop out at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ll share with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I like to go and sit in coffee shops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have this tiny little RV and it’s like. right now, I went and parked it in a parking lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I love being in this RV. The world is around me and I’m contained in this little beautiful energy bubble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t know why I brought that out but it’s my unique way of getting away from everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, if you’re in a house, the energy [is challenging], especially if you’re with other people. I know this isn’t true too much with Terry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But occasionally<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I like being in my own space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is something that I’ve had for a lot of my life – it’s very weird.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">One of the things that are in my background is being a singer/songwriter. But truthfully the singer/songwriter part of me goes back to being a troubadour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Troubadours can’t have a home. They have to travel around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They go into a city and they suddenly create a circumstance where they have a home and then they move to the next city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s limited. I used to do that in this lifetime.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I was so bad at having a home that even when I had a home and I had to make phone calls, instead of calling somebody from my home I’d go to a telephone booth. This is crazy!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I used to watch this when I was younger and I couldn’t figure it out but I accepted it. I understand it now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I could connect with somebody from a telephone booth better than from my home.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The reason was, even though I had a home, I didn’t know how to make it a home because I had this troubadour part of me that identified with having a home as being uncreative, being trapped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I was on the road, all these amazing things would happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I used to go to telephone booths to make phone calls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve never heard anyone say that before in their life; that was my own unique [eccentricity].</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I would just say odd experience.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Odd experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I knew it was true and I allowed myself to do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I didn’t try to think I needed a shrink because I needed to make phone calls from phone booths.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I’m going to make a challenge to all of you who are listening and not talking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Instead of thinking, “I don’t have anything important to say; I’m not worthy to speak,” or anything like that,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I want somebody to say, “I have something to say,” and just start rambling and let yourself talk without knowing what you’re going to say next.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Who has the courage to do that?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Steve</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I sort of like what Nimoway said, like try to be simple kind of guy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>[By the way,] I can get off [my headset].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I purchased the headset on Amazon.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Steve</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I thought [what Nimoway said] was very poetic and very endearing; I really liked it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You must be a very sweet, nice person, Nimoway.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Anyone else want to say anything?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Tracy</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I do, Wynn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Tracy</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">West Virginia</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Everything you said today, everything Carla said – has really hit home to me. something that I found [ in their words is that] the most promising way to actually relate to people or change people and change the world is simply be kind to them and listen to them and to not judge them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I, like you, go out of my way every day to take people that I see that nobody is doing this with and just spend a little bit of time with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I ask for those experiences and they do come to me just like they do you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Seriously, it’s a small, it’s a little tiny thing but it makes such a huge difference in people’s lives. You can look at these people a few days later and you can see that suddenly they don’t feel as badly about themselves or their experiences or whatever they’re going through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t take that much time to give somebody a little attention, a little bit of recognition, a little bit of your own [reassurance] that whatever you’re feeling is okay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Don’t judge yourself so hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s little but it’s big.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you so much for sharing and affirming what we’re saying.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Let’s just suppose that you’re God’s representative down here and all those people you run into aren’t meeting many people who are God’s representatives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They’re meeting people who are part of God but not consciously caring in the way that you’re able to care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The little slightest kindness and the little slightest wisdom that comes through you spontaneously can change that person for the rest of their life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I know there were people who did this for me when I was younger; they didn’t even know they said it but they went out of their way to say it for one reason or another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I thought about it for months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Each of us has the ability to do that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When you start doing that; when you really assume that responsibility of being spirit’s representative down here, you catch the attention of spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>People want to know, “How do I connect with the higher realms?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Start doing that and you can’t help but connect with the higher realms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They start paying attention to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Tracy</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One of the things that I’ve found [is] that there are so many people that feel shame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am an ordained minister, and I counsel a lot of people, mostly sexually, honestly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s just amazing how many people have these horrible feelings about themselves. And you don’t have to change that person to enhance that person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All you have to do is show that person that it’s okay to be who they are or to have the experience or the thoughts that they think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They are different and the world is different.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You said sex, right?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Tracy</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sexually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I do a lot of sexual counseling.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sex is one of those things that people have been conditioned to feel bad about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve read this, and I think it’s true, that in olden times, thousands of years ago, the reason sex had so many prohibitions in it is because sex is something that empowers somebody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Those beings in this realm that wanted to control others didn’t want people empowered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>[Even today] they tell them, “Don’t have sex.” They have a bunch of people that aren’t feeling empowered and they’re easy to control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s how I think all the prohibitions of sex have come about; through religion, through everything else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s one of those areas!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I don’t think you’re supposed to be promiscuous. I think you have to be very discerning about who you partner with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But, I don’t think sex is bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In general, it’s better to make a mistake and move on than not do anything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">That’s true of anything in life, whether you’re trying to make money, or you’re trying to find love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you don’t do anything, you’re stuck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you make mistakes, you’re learning and you’re increasing your discernment and you’re increasing the possibilities of success.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">A lot of people are afraid of making a mistake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What if I get the wrong person?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Just don’t get somebody that has a disease, that’s all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Don’t get somebody that’s going to stalk you, or want to hurt you if it doesn’t work out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Other than that, [just] get somebody who is strong enough, and you are strong enough, so that if it doesn’t work out, you can go back to where you were.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You always have the place where you were.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Sex is a hot topic; one day we’ll have a juicy Monday night with Carla talking about sex.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s certainly a wide and broad topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can talk about sex all the way from sexual addiction to sacred sexuality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Any of those levels are wonderful to talk about.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Again, it’s something that you have to experience without judging yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think it was Shakespeare, what did he say?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“To thine own self be true”<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn7;" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""></a><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote;"><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></span></span></span> This is one of those areas where you can’t make a one-size-fits-all rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Everyone has to figure out [this for themselves].</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There is no one-size-fits-all sexuality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The thing of it is, there is a one-size-fits-all love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You have to lean on the love and then be creative about the physical details.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ll bet Carla has some juicy things to share! We’ll get a lot of listeners if I put that up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>69-year-old Rueckert is about to explode [with stories] here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’d just really make our day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Anyone else have something they want to share?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Gijs</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes – that I believe sex is the greatest God-given exercise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Alleluia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Amen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Not that we use it well, but it has that potential.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Anyone else?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Is there anyone on the line that feels really guilty and ashamed about sex that wants to admit it?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Caller</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Feeling good about sex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sorry!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Anyone on the line besides Gijs who is having a great sex life who wants to admit it?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Anyone want to say anything before we sign this show off?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>God bless everybody.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you all who are listening.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">You know I said earlier, that Carla and I can go on and on because it’s co-creative and that we bounce off of each other?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It took me a while to get into the space where I could totally be myself around Carla because she intimidated me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was like, “I’ve got the great Carla Rueckert on the line and I’d better not screw up.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But that’s part of growing together, trusting each other.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When you are dealing in lower level stuff, oftentimes, if you express any kind of weakness, everyone jumps on you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Even I have done that with people here and there, where they’re getting vulnerable and expressing their weakness. I’ve done [it] with Terry, I confess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I said, “Yes, you’re always like that.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s not a good thing to do because then you shut down the energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It’s great on these calls where we can be totally ourselves, totally vulnerable. [We can0 talk about our own processes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Our processes are your processes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Learning how we process the day is a way that you can learn how to process your day in your own way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you find your own successful ways of processing your day, we can all learn from you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Life is a creation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’re all in the middle of the creation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’re all learning how to play bigger parts in the creations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You guys inspire me; Carla inspires me; Terry inspires me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s why it can go on and on like this and the energy doesn’t die.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It’s not because we’re all such interesting people, even though we probably are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s because we have the courage to co-create with each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I can say anything, Carla can say anything, and Terry can say anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is the co-creative energy that goes on and on and on that changes our worlds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Learning how to co-create with your own life with the people around you, and realize that you’re co-creating not only with the people around you; we’re co-creating with the creator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’re co-creating with God; every one of us in this realm is playing that part.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">You’re not here to disempower yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As that famous quote by Marianne Williamson<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn8;" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""></a><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote;"><span class="FootnoteCharacters"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">[8]</span></span></span></span> – I read that, I said “I understand that” – that said each of us can step up to the plate and be the light we are, but we’re afraid to, all of us, [including me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I] learned that as you do that, it’s one of the ways you get more joy, more fun.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I’m talking too long and I’m blowing my climax in what I’m saying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Now I’m being honest, because I said I could see myself doing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If I take another step, I’m going to do it, so I’m just going to tell everybody I’m doing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That is being in the moment; following the track.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Saying, “It’s okay.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I can’t even remember what I said now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think you were trying to move into a moment where you could show how ineffable everything was and the trouble with that is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>when you get close to showing that, you run out of words.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m around people who have better vocabularies than me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s just a matter of how much you like to read.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What does ineffable mean?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ll bet there are a bunch of people who didn’t know what that meant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Ineffable means you can’t really pin it down with words, or describe it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Indescribable, I suppose, could work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s very hard to capture an essence, let’s put it that way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Once you move into essence, it’s very hard to talk about it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes you move into essence and the words keep floating above essence, or just below it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s like that moment of space where I always say that the interdimensional energies are in spaces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I start talking, I just find myself having this incredible space between my words rushing in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I go to that moment where if I stop talking now, we’re all going to go into a state of meditation and everyone is going to be together in that meditation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Dancing around that space is a really interesting place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I used to write songs and poems, and that what I always tried to reach for in that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Wynn, I didn’t tell you!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have something to tell you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve been doing my poems and I understand from the archive website webmaster that they will be up soon, up on site [and available in print.].</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On your site?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m not saying my poems are particularly good, but I did finally edit them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s wonderful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That’s one of my projects.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s one of those things you never, ever do, normally. After five decades of them I finally sat down. I really can’t write at this point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m on pain medication. I’m not that sharp. And I want to make sure that I get everything when I’m actually writing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">I’m doing things that I actually can do well, even with pain medication and not feeling well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I just finished the poems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It feels so good to have something positive done, not that I think my poems are so hot.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">When you talk about metaphysical subjects, then there is always a possibility that you might be talking about something that somebody wants to think about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Even though my poems aren’t all that good, they might be a resource.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m glad to be putting them online, just in case one of them might help somebody.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On one of my mailings occasionally I put one of my old poems up and always I get an email back from someone who realizes that I really am human and that I really did go through a lot of experience in life and that I did have pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It helps connect with the rest of my work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All this channeling stuff can get so exalted in other people’s minds that they don’t realize it came from a human.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have a section called “Love Poetry”. I put all the poetry I had written specifically for a guy in that section, and of course that’s where [one reader] went first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>[This] one person read through and he said “I didn’t realize that you had such horrible experiences in love.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s not that I had [nothing but] horrible experiences in love; it’s that I [only] wrote about the bad ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He couldn’t imagine that I would have a difficult time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>[It’s] sure, if you’re going through real life, you’re going through real disturbances and real disappointments and real catalysts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>[As] a singer/songwriter, when I was younger, I used to adjust my life to go through things so I could write more songs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was like having a stable relationship was like having a home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Once you had a stable relationship, there was nothing to write about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You had to be moving in and out of relationships to get the inspiration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When you met me, Carla, it was when I first met Daphne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was in that space.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You were living in your van and selling sunglasses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And writing poems.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carla</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Good poems.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then, I stopped wanting to put my poems out. When I was younger, writing poems and songs, I thought no one ever understand me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I had this depth and I never could express who I really was to anybody. So I started writing songs and poems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then, everybody used to think, “Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am going through that too.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It really encouraged me to be an artist, because suddenly people were understanding me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Or, I was waking up the part of me that’s them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Terry, you’re not saying enough you know.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Should I push you to say something or should I just let you be quiet?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can have a choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Go ahead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Terry</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’m enjoying listening to people, so I’ll just be quiet some more.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wynn</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Alright.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You see, we can go on and on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I said I was going to do ten minutes and now we’ve done thirty minutes and Carla doesn’t want to leave.</span></p>
