<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This is 12.12.12. A lot of people give this date special significance because of all the twelves being together.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">One time I asked a question about that; not 12.12.12; it was another one of those multi-digit calendar days. I didn’t get a clear answer about that being something special, except for the fact that because people thought it was that they created an energy to it and that energy was real.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You know, sometimes people make excuses for holidays and it doesn’t matter because they’re still on holidays. So if this is 12.12.12 and there’s something to it, we will participate in all those 12.12.12 energies that are going around on the planet right now. We’ll bring in our own energy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">My name is Wynn Free, here with Terry Brown; we welcome everybody on BBS Radio and everyone that’s on the conference line. I thank you all for being here. As many of you are learning, these are unusual calls; they are really unusual. Sometimes it takes a while to get the hang of it. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When things are happening in invisible realms, when you feel shifts of energy, we’re not going to go to a scientist and say, “Hey that happened”, but you know that it happened. There are so many people that get on this call that are feeling shifts of energy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We have voices that are talking to us that say they’re connecting with you and that’s how it feels. It’s usually very positive and it’s usually very uplifting. I’m just speaking from the kinds of emails I get; people suddenly feel their hearts open, their depressions go away. I’m glad to say that I’m not doing it; I’m just showing up. It would be scary if I thought I was doing it because my phone rings off the hook enough. I am just a facilitator; Terry is a facilitator and Daphne is a facilitator.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Let me see; she was going to show up tonight; let’s see if she’s here. Are you here, Daphne?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; I am here, Wynn.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; You know Daphne’s been on sabbatical. When she does these sessions, it’s kind of hard to figure Daphne out, even for me. Sometimes she does them and she feels really great. Other times she gets all kinds of side-effects when she channels. We talk and we theorize and we try to figure out how she can clear all that.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Is there anything you’d like to share with everyone?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Can you hear me?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; We hear you loud and clear.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Alright.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It’s the much-heralded 12.12.12 and we’re moving into the 12.21, so for me personally this has been exceedingly intense. I think it has been for some other people, too. For other people, it’s been very uplifting and very good.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Yes.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Here’s a question I’m probably not going to ask, or maybe I’ll answer it myself. This is from a guy named Dan. He said:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">“I thought things were screwed up on earth, but now that I know about the Elohim, things don’t seem much better up there. This is very depressing. The Universe appears to be run by a bunch of incompetents.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I don’t know, Dan, how closely you’ve tracked us, but the key element to the way this realm got started was to create free will as opposed to slavery. Within the context of free will, things would unfold how they unfolded. It’s as if you had some children and you were bringing them up; many people do have children and they know their children are going to do what their children want to do. They’re not going to do what the parents want them to do.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When they’re young, the parents try to influence them in a positive way, hopefully. Sometimes, they don’t do that. Sometimes the parents are screwed up because their parents were screwed up and all this stuff gets passed down. The one key element that I get in this connection with the Elohim and the higher groups, the Ra group, is, they don’t run this realm. They co-create with it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It would be, again, as if you had a child that was screwing up and screwing up and doing drugs. You can’t stop them from doing that, but one day they call up and they say, “Dad, I need help” and you’re there. That’s the way it works.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We’re on this line, in a sense, saying, “Dad, we need help.” Many of us have found that they become present and active if we ask. Otherwise, if they just did things without anybody asking, we wouldn’t grow. We’d be a bunch of slaves. The goal, from their point of view, is to create spiritual growth, to create expansion into the higher realms, not just to placate us and give us whatever we want.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As you start to expand into the higher realms—you may not know what that means; you’ll know it when you know it—but when that starts to happen, that’s when this thing that Jesus said kicks in: “Put the kingdom of heaven first and everything else will be given to you.” The addendum to that is that it doesn’t matter at that point. It matters if you’re struggling to survive; it matters if you have a family and people depending on you. It does matter, in that sense.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Say in terms of ambition, in terms of what you want to become, how you want people to see you, being wealthy or famous; you don’t care about those things any more. Thank you, Dan for your question. I don’t think I’ll ask it. They may want to say something about it. Now that I’ve read it, who knows what they’re going to do? I thank you all for sending in your questions.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We have some really interesting questions tonight. Terry? Hello, Terry; are you there?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Yes, I’m here.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Is it okay if Daphne answers a question tonight?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Sure, that’d be great.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Yes? You don’t have a question for her, do you?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Maybe that: what’s the meaning of 12.12.12?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Okay; that’d be a good one: What’s the meaning of 12.12.12? From an Elohim point of view, the whole Universe is put together by mathematics. Numbers mean something. There’s a whole science called ‘numerology’ that puts numbers together and tries to create interpretations.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I noticed when I was younger, aside from doing astrology, I was paying attention to numbers, but I never studied them; I did notice that there were certain numbers that kept re-occurring in my life. For example: The street address that I grew up on kept re-occurring in different ways. It would re-occur, or close to it, in phone numbers of people that I would be connecting to. I put together the idea that maybe it had to do with grounding, since it was where I grew up, the street numbers.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What do you think, Daphne? Do you think that would relate to grounding?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; I think it depends on the street number itself, because clearly it’s your home, so there is an aspect of grounding. I also had a combination of 1 and 9 and 7 which kept showing up in my life as my parent’s home, as my husband’s zip code, telephone number; each of those numbers in itself has a meaning, so the combination, when you put it together, has meaning too.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I think I would say “yes” to you, but there’s also more you can play with that, too.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Okay. Let’s get started with people’s questions. What I’m going to do is I’ll call in the Light and I’ll see if our Sources have anything to say through Terry just in manner of introduction. Then we’ll go through the questions.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Father-Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light, to surround and protect each person on this line and any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the energy fields of the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth. Right now we invoke a group energy connection, while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One, to join with us as we create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I turn it over to Terry to do an introduction, or a welcome, from our Sources.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator. This is </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the 12<sup>th</sup> of December, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. The sun has moved, positioned itself more toward the south and it is getting colder in the Northern Hemisphere. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We look in on the individuals in the earth realm and we greet each and every one of you. We are available to you, the ones that wish us to be available to them. We are totally free-will; we don’t know what the word is here; we are a totally free-will group; an individual which allows free will.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If one does not wish to connect with us we know that and we do not connect. We connect to a degree that you seek.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We are available to you. We are taking a moment here to orient. We see that there are, within the earth plane, different groups who celebrate the winter and bring cheer into the darker days when the sun does not shine as long. This brings cheer and connection with individuals. It is a time of love and time of connection and a time of drawing close.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; “For many decades I’ve been on earth and I have been astounded at all the things I don’t know. Although I amaze myself with innate instincts about things and concepts I have no knowledge of. Is this a flow from the junk DNA we carry?”</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I would add the question: Is it something, flash-throughs from other dimensions or other lifetimes? That’s what I would add to that. Now, going back to her question:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">“Secondly, since my early childhood, it’s been my belief that once you pass over to the other side you know and understand everything; everything is correlated and inter-related; are these assumptions correct?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">That’s from Angeline in </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Marionville</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Canada</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. Terry?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Thank you. When one passes over to the other side, they do not necessarily know everything; it depends upon the baggage that they carry when they move to the other side and it depends upon their focus. What do we mean by baggage?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There are memories that one can become immersed in; there are energies that one can become immersed in and carry to the other side. So then, as they are on the other side, they still do not have the awareness to know all. There is a school in the heavenly realm where one may read of the Book of Knowledge and may ask questions and may learn at a greater rate.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If one is very clear, they can then observe and they can focus on what is around them and have extra-sensory perception and begin to be able to see things that others do not see even though they are in the higher realms, because as they, themselves, become an instrument of viewing and open to the higher frequencies, they can increase their sensory perception beyond that of the lower earth plane and can increase it into the higher realms.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">An analogy would be when one sees colors. If one could increase their sensory perception, they could see into the ultra-violet range or down into the infra-red range. There are ranges of frequencies above one; one can, when they become clearly able to re-focus and to not get their attentions locked on some of the lower vibrations, they can begin to have a wider range of knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When one is in the earth plane, there are many things based upon how they were brought up where they were oriented in one way or another. This can cause them to be not completely focused as they would wish, as they have been given commands from their parents, rituals perhaps, that they may perform, beliefs that they have, according to what their parents believed and instilled in them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This causes them to participate in other things, which they, of themselves, think may be extraneous. There are consensus realities of procedures and of social graces that are in various cultures that one may come to believe are a waste of time, yet one is influenced by them, by their past and by their groups, to do them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When one is in the third density, it becomes harder to think a thought and to have it take place, as the physical Universe needs to respond and to re-form and to manifest. It can become very frustrating to be in the physical Universe, as there are many things that a person need do in order to survive; the cleaning, the mundane things, the taking out of the garbage, things which, as they may not be in the person’s purpose, their lasered-purpose mind, then they may consider it frustrating. However, many people enjoy the cleaning and that is their profession. Then they may have other things that they do not feel comfortable doing.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But, there is a time delay entered between the thoughts and the actions and accomplishment of the goal in the third density that makes things frustrating. We hope this has shed some light on this.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">: &nbsp;Thank you.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Next question: This is a question I want to pose for Daphne; are you there, Daphne?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Yes, I am here.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Okay. Somebody sent me a photo; do you remember Terry Cole-Whittaker? She was a very pleasant minister, on TV quite often. She sent somebody a picture where she was somewhere; where was she? Mount Shasta? I don’t remember. She saw the sun; it seemed like a second sun in the sky.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Now some time ago, through Daphne, there was a message that came through, something about this shift, about there being two suns in the sky. Maybe we could have some more explanation of that. If Terry Cole-Whittaker took a picture and there was a second sun, how come we can’t all see it?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Thank you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne:&nbsp; </span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is an interesting one, because I’ve been getting pictures from people in </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Australia</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> since 10.10.10. Give me a moment.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ra’An:&nbsp; </span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We greet you in the Love and the Light of The One Infinite Creator. This is Ra’An, on your date of the 12.12.12. There are many anomalies and many physical signs and wonders at this gateway, at this opportunity for attunement and reconciliation of those higher matrix frequencies of perceptions and analogous transportations.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">By transportations, we speak of those inherent energies, those inherent gateways, those inherent transduction lines by which certain souls are compelled to experience certain experiences.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Regarding organs of perception, from your 3D vantage point there are anomalies, there are phenomena, which are occurring with a more intense stream-lined focused effect and punctuating your 3D density-reality with those images beyond the 3D density-reality. And, in this way, peppering, or we would say, ‘salting and peppering’, the 3D density in preparation, for an expansion of consciousness which would lead those souls which are so able to continue a journey of expansion and unfoldment, incorporating into their own perceptual mechanisms those experiences which lie beyond the 3D matrix.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The short and the simple is that you are being introduced to that which is beyond your current framework, in a way which would preserve the present framework in so far as it is necessary for a peaceful evolution into stages of higher consciousness.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When moving a civilization from one level of consciousness to another, care must be taken not to introduce elements too quickly, as panic or mass hysteria is to be avoided. These are negative outcomes and serve only to hurt the learning populace.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">That being said, the phenomenon of the two suns is indeed real. There is indeed, beyond this dimensional perspective, a multiplicity of suns; there does exist a binary star-system. As the DNA unfolds, as it is able to calibrate and incorporate more light, one is able to traverse the time-space continuum and the dimensional field, bringing in perceptions of a multiplicity of phenomena that exists in the here and now, for all things do exist in the here and now. Time travel shall be possible. Cosmos travel shall be possible.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It is as if you were arriving at a huge way-station, a huge galactic transport station. Depending upon the level of consciousness, your main focal point of the consciousness, the main place you have arrived. You shall depart at this time in these coming months unto a journey that includes the highest expansion of consciousness possible, wherein you have attained a certain threshold, a certain calibration, a certain attunement.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you make yourself as a string on an instrument, you have perhaps been hovering around a D or a D# or an F or a G. It is there you shall be going. It is there on this new higher frequency you shall be moving; it is there you shall be exploring. It is a point of embarkation.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We hope this has helped.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I’ll address this other question to Daphne; it’s from Claire. Claire asks; I think this is kind of funny:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">“If the Elohim want to speak with you (me) why do they not do so directly rather than through external channels?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> (through Daphne):&nbsp; I can answer that from my consciousness.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; I could too.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Why do you go to a concert to listen to Itzhak Perlman? I’m not comparing myself to Itzhak Perlman. Why do you go to an acupuncturist or why do you go to an art museum? You go to see or to hear or to experience those people who have honed their craft. Everyone has craft, everyone has gifts; it’s discernment of course. Everyone practices and has most likely lifetimes of experience honing a certain craft, a certain precision, a certain frequency.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you look at Carla Rueckert’s material, if you look at the Ra Material or the Jane Roberts material, the level of craftsmanship there is phenomenal. Clearly those people had lifetimes and lifetimes of doing this kind of transmission work. Just as there are people—like Terry is a master painter; I’m a bumbling musician, but I love it. I think that it’s a matter of skill and perseverance and something that’s built over eons of experience. That’s just my human answer.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; I think that it can appear to someone that the Elohim say, “Let’s decide to talk to this person or that person.” What they don’t realize is that the people that end up having this kind of high-level communication have developed it as a talent. It’s a two-way thing; a receiver has to be on and tuned to the right frequency. Not only that, their intent has to be high.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you read <i>The Creator Gods of the Physical Universe Want to Talk to You</i>, you found out that when Daphne and I were first experiencing each other in 2002, I asked the questions, things like, “How do I connect with the parts of myself that are in higher dimensions? I know I’ve got all these synchronicities; can you tell me more?” They said, “Write your dreams down.” So that night I put a pad by my bed and I wrote my dreams down, what I thought were my dreams; I would wake up and I would scrawl something on the pad.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In the morning when I looked on the pad there were all these sentences, kind of a wise guidance that they were giving me. It wasn’t dreams; it was things like: <i>You have to look tall and thin. You’re supposed to be the front man. We’re not doing this for entertainment; it has a serious purpose. Communication from another dimension, just like Cayce (he slept to connect with this dimension). It’s the insanity of passion that makes things happen in the real world.</i> I looked at that and I, said, “I must truly be going nuts.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Here I am, writing <i>The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce?</i>; I’m about two months into having conversations with a voice that says they’re the Elohim through Daphne and suddenly they’re coming through in my dreams.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I have more of an affinity with the Ra group I believe, than the Elohim group; so I tune to the Ra group’s frequency. You notice when I talk; I can talk and I bring in a lot of wisdom when I talk and a lot of understanding. It’s the Ra group kind of wisdom.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Daphne brings in celestial information; Terry kind of brings in a cross. We’re talking to both groups, but my energetic leaning is more towards being a Ra Wanderer.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Another thing is; if one wanted to design a circumstance to bring this into the public awareness, I don’t think it could be better designed. The way the story unfolded, the way that there are two people doing it. I don’t think they designed that; I think that was an act of Divine stumble-bumblism; that it just occurred that there were two people in my life that had the talent to bring this through. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I had the public, the ability to be a public speaker about it, so that I could get it to people. It’s far more effective than me coming on the line and saying, “Hi this is Wynn, blah blah. Now we’re going to have the Elohim.” I wouldn’t believe me; it’s hard to believe this is real. The way it’s come about makes it a lot more accessible and interesting to people, because there’s so much phenomena attached to it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Do you want to comment on that, either Daphne or Terry?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; What do you think, Terry?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Yes. Could you give me a short summary because I came clear out of trance and I don’t know what we were talking about.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; You can go back into trance; I’ll tell you what. Go back into trance and answer from their point of view: “Why don’t they talk to me?”</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Terry</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Oh, okay.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Thank you. Give us a moment.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We try and we try to talk to people and we have tried different things to be able to get through. One of them is to have a merger with the frequencies of the Ra group and the frequencies of the Elohim group, so that we have a broader frequency that we could get through on. We comprehend much more than people think that we do, because of such a high frequency that when we respond they may get a feeling of response or a feeling of energy, but the fine-tuning of it in words and sometimes the larger concept does not always get through.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But, one can be aware that when they talk to us we listen and we make ourselves available first of all in the area of concepts, providing an energy that contains the concept. Hopefully, the person will be able to utilize this in some way. For instance, when you do the calling in of the Light, you present a concept to consensus reality and it is beyond language. So when we get a prayer, a communication, a desire, a yearning, a wishing from someone in your realm, then we are available to them. We listen.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This has been one of our fondest hopes: that the individuals in your realm can know that we care. We look at an individual’s growth, at potential for growth. We see sometimes the lessons are very hard and we do not interfere where it is not for the highest good. But we are available and we are there and we are beyond the English language, beyond the workings of the lower frequencies; we are beyond that. Very often it is very hard for individuals in the third density to connect or to know that they’re connected with us, even though they are connected with us.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Thank you. Maybe I can take this opportunity: Daphne, I thought I would ask a question that sometimes is your question. I’ll tell you what the question is and if you give me permission I’ll ask it, okay?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Okay.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; The question is: Daphne comes from a tradition of using the word ‘God’ and thinking of God in a somewhat traditional way. Sometimes she finds a conflict in the word ‘God’. “Who are the Elohim and what is their relationship to this word, the normal use in this realm of the word ‘God’?” That’s the question; would they explain that to us?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Is that okay with you, Daphne, to ask that?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Are you going to ask it through Terry?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Through Terry, yes.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Yes.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Okay; so do we have an answer to that? Did you understand the question?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Yes. Thank you. We are delighted with your question, as sometimes individuals put us up and label us ‘God’. Sometimes when they can see us, there are individuals that can see us, and they assign us the status of God, or God itself; we do not consider ourselves to be God, although some other beings in the third density do consider us gods. We do not consider ourselves as such; we consider that there is—we get beyond words at this point—there is and it’s very faded on descriptive words to say, ‘All That Is’. There is a power beyond time and space, but it is not of time and space. There are guidelines that the logos can take advantage of in setting up the rules for their local galaxies and their local star systems.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There is a force that is not an old man with a beard, but an all-knowing, all-seeing force that is beyond existence, because it’s beyond space and time. We would consider that closer to what you would call God. It is a force that dearly loves the life-forms and is pulling and rooting for the life-forms and for their growth in the difficult multi-Universe.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We hope that helps.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; When a person that is not sophisticated to all this understanding of logos and sub-logos, etc. and they have just learned the word ‘God’ and they use the word ‘God’ and they make requests using the word ‘God’, does the Elohim or the Ra group sometimes answer those requests on behalf of All That Is?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Yes; as an instrument of as you say, ‘All That Is’, as an instrument of this, in the way things are designed to work. We are aware and we do what we can for the highest good to bring <span style="color: black;">their wishes.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Thank you. We have some requests from Theresa; Theresa, maybe next week I will ask one of your requests. What you’re asking is kind of on the order of a very personal reading. For most people, we try to pick the questions that are broad enough that even when it’s personal it can reach other people as well.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I thank you for your question; watch for next week. Maybe try to re-send it and pick the question that is most relevant. I’ll give you an example. You asked the question: Will my financial situation improve in the New Year? And, you’re thinking that there’s a destiny that is not in your hands, that you don’t create that. The fact of the matter is, if something changes, you’re part of the creation of it. The question would be better put: How do I change my financial situation from where it is now so it’s better? Talk about some of your obstacles. That would be more likely to get a better answer. Thank you, though, for asking.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Next question, this is from Caleb. I don’t know where he is; he asked his question before, but he tried to refine it. “It’s said that the answer to why anything exists at all is joy. Joy, the answer to why we strive throughout many lives into infinity is to find and express joy. But, is joy really kind of like a drug to placate us, because otherwise we’d go mad, existing forever in infinity, trapped in infinity, doomed to be conscious for all time; is joy really an answer in itself? What is joy and why should everything’s existence be dependent on having joy?” Thank you. That’s from Caleb.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Would you like to answer that Daphne?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; I could give it a try, sure.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Okay.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ra’An</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; We greet you in the Love and the Light of The One Infinite Creator. You have asked; you have presented us with a very pertinent question; a question which is seemingly at the heart and the desire nature of what you would assume to be the physical expression of manifest experience.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Indeed, joy is desirous. It is desire-full; it is full of desire. It is awakening consciousness reflecting back upon its state as awakening consciousness, thus blending <span style="color: black;">into over-layers,</span> moving forward in the envelope of the space-time continuum. It is a fuel; it is a propellant. It creates creation; it makes creation ‘go’.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In the final estimation, if there is no go, if there is no fuel, if there is no juice, there is stasis. Stasis, stop; creation ceases. There must be love; there must be joy and there must be compassion for creation, to continue to create. Else, all is in status and begins to implode.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Daphne</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; This is me talking now. I’m getting a very strong sense that they’re saying that if we don’t have joy, if we don’t have exuberance, if we don’t give love, there really is no purpose in these human-dimensional expressions. It’s the highest purpose that we have here; something that I’ve grappled with for a long time myself.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Are there any other questions?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">:&nbsp; Thank you. Its </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">7:58</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> and we have to come to a close. I took the time because Daphne hasn’t been here for a while, to ask a couple questions on her behalf. Those of you that asked questions that were scheduled and didn’t get asked, I apologize; put them in for next week and I will give them first priority.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Also, I’ll be sending out an email tomorrow. We are going to do a special grid healing on December 22, 2012 at 8:00 p.m. Pacific, that’s going to be broadcast on BBS Radio as well as on a phone line. I’m going to encourage you to share that with everyone and invite them to that. This will be particularly addressed to having a lot of new people on the line.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Watch for it. I’m really grateful that Daphne came in tonight and shared; she brings another energy to these calls; it’s really beautiful. I hope she’ll want to come in the future. Of course, I thank Terry for being such a stable influence in holding all of this together and her own dedication.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">On that note, we’ll bring this call to a close. Thank you all for being here and holding the energy that makes it possible to do this in a public way. We’ll see many of you on our public grid healing. Thank you. Everybody’s unmuted. It sounds like a party going on out there!</span></p>

Sometimes information may bleed through from the conscious mind of the channel. It is possible that a negative Source may interfere. Apply your own discernment; take only what resonates and discard the rest. An answer to a question is meant for the person asking the question and you have the privilege of listening in because sometimes you can gain insights from the answer. However, even though the circumstances may be similar, do not merely assume the answer applies to you.</span></i></span></p>
