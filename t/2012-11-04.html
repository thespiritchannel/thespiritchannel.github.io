<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Sunday Call 11/04/12<br />Audio: <a href="https://intelligentinfinity.egnyte.com/h-s/20121104/98ee35da09e64b38">https://intelligentinfinity.egnyte.com/h-s/20121104/98ee35da09e64b38</a><br />Host: Wynn Free<br />Channeled by Terry Brown<br />Transcribed by Cynthia Izzo<br />Edited by Terry Brown and Valerie Hawes<br /><span face="Calibri, sans-serif">Formatted and sent by </span><span face="Calibri, sans-serif">Aharon ben Or</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> Let’s shut our eyes and move back into that space of oneness and connection with each other and the group souls…It’s not the words that are magic, it’s the energy tracking that goes with the words that changes your relationship with the universe.</span></span></p>
<p><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the Light</b></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> to surround and protect Terry, myself, everyone on this line, everyone on the replays and any negativity be taken to the highest realms of Light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet Earth, through our bodies and into the center of the Earth. Right now, we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring </span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><i>The Law of One</i></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> to join with us and we create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave </span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><i>now</i></span><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">. </span></span></p>
<p><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We turn it over to our sources who explain themselves to be these two group souls, one of which created the universe, and allow them to take the podium for the message of this morning. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"><b>Ra’An:</b></span></span><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator. This is Ra’An. This is the 4</span></span><sup><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">th</span></span></sup><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;"> of November, 2012 and we expand our look, our energy, to include each and every person on this line and we impart and are available to impart, Love and Light and healing to each and every person who wishes it and asks for it. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">If you have others that you are sending love light to, if they are open, they will also receive it and it can help to stack the deck in favor of their healing. It is like having other people on your team that can make a difference. One does not have to be on the line to know that there is an energy that is favorable to them and is working toward their healing. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We look farther across the earth and we see the results of hurricane Sandy and we, in the field of all of those people, send strength, that they may make a network, an electronic grid that it is stronger and that the destruction that happened be replaced with a strength in building codes. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We see a cold front that is also coming and is propelled by the factors in the stratosphere. We send strength that the electricity may go on before this cold front arrives. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We take a look further at 2 other areas. One of them is the New Madrid fault and we see weaknesses in that area and we send strength and we see that those individuals in the area need to pay attention to conditions and need to have within their area, within their own homes, a preparation in case of earthquake activity and the same for the areas of California. On top of that we send strength to the fault lines, that they may withstand any untoward influences towards destabilization. We give a minute to this. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We look at Fukushima and we see the need for intelligent preparation to re-situate their storage of nuclear waste and that individuals there may rise to the occasion and may put into effect new rules that will stabilize the area.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We send love light to all of the families across the globe, all of the mothers and fathers, all of the children that are working to have a stable life. We send Love Light to all of the employers that are offering jobs and we send strength to the economy that it may support the individuals with their interaction, with their own lives and with their jobs that they may become supported and we are mindful of those that are in need of support at this time. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">We recommend holding within your vision the goals that you wish to achieve and also do not discount where you are at, for you start every journey where you are. If you accept where you are and then hold as a vision where you are going, the goals that you have in mind, and then you have your journey in mind and can begin to make in-roads into the area in which you wish to be. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Similarly, when one is working to increase and heal oneself, keep where you are going in mind, and also where you are at, to accept where you are at, but yet keep the vision of where you are going totally burning and in your mind, then you will begin to move from where you are to where you wish to go. You may check out other opportunities for healing in areas where you have not checked and may find other avenues for healing.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">This is a sacred moment in time that we have this interaction, contact, with each one of you who wish it. We thank you for this. </span></span></p>
