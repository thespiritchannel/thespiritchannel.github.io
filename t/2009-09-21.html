You’re cutting out.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I’m just meeting everybody. Normally I say hello to everybody at this time.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Well I think that’s wonderful. It’s just that I couldn’t hear anything. If somebody asks a question later, be sure and repeat it for me.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Okay. Actually, I can’t hear them either. But they can ask a question by pushing * 6. That un-mutes them and then they can push * 6 again and mute themselves. Terry is with us. Carla, I called her about ten minutes ago and I said, “You know what, Carla said she would love to have you on and Terry told me, “Uh-oh, I’m blushing.” She got very shy. I told her she could be in the background.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">That’s okay. You know, my husband doesn’t say as much as I do, but when he says something, everybody stops listening to me and listens to him because he doesn’t talk all the time.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I can’t tell you how many times we’ve done these Monday night sessions. If I give you the agenda for what we do on Monday, Terry works with [a legal] office. And at </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">6:00</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">, when she gets off from work, she goes across the street, drives her car into the parking lot of McDonald’s and she sits in her car. And then the Elohim talk to us. So actually people say, “Wynn, stop talking! Where’s Terry? Put Terry on.”</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Terry, Carla and I were starting off tonight telling jokes because everyone expects [us to be] really heavy and intense. Carla, you didn’t know this but at one time I made up a bunch of jokes. I was waiting to be successful at it. I would know when I was successful when somebody came up to me and told me one of my own jokes back to me. But it didn’t happen. Maybe I’ll tell a couple of my jokes now and that way it gives it another chance to get it started, it’s actually a line of octopus jokes, okay?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">That’s so cute. I have an Episcopalian priest who hails from </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Oklahoma</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> and he was brought up in a hard-shell Baptist church. Every summer, when there are not quite so many people in the congregation, we lighten up from being high church a little bit. He starts bringing out those old Baptist hymns. In the years I’ve been singing in the choir there I’ve learned quite a few of them. They’re great and the basses love them because they get more work. They get to sing all the parts in between. I’d better stop on this—this isn’t even a joke!</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wait a second Carla.

Do I know it?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It’s a wonderful tuning song. We were talking before we came on the air about ways of tuning. Telling jokes is one way. [Singing a hymn is another.] Are you ready?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wait. Before you sing it, tell people what tuning is. You use that like everyone knows it, but that’s a special word.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Okay, well I figure most everybody has had “Oppornockity” come and tune, right?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">What have they had?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Oppornockity coming and tuning your piano. Mr. Oppornockity?<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="http://www.llresearch.org/interviews/interview_2009_0921.aspx#_ftn1"><span style="mso-bookmark: _ftnref1;"><span style="color: #cc00cc;">[1]</span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: _ftnref1;"></span></a><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Anyway, tuning is just like tuning an instrument, only the instrument is yourself. You’re a wind instrument and your thoughts have a certain kind of energy that’s like the wind and your voice is a literal wind. You’re using your precious breath, the breath of life, in order to say words. So with everything that you say, you’re basically saying it as a musical instrument that is tuned more or less in tune with your instincts and your intuition and the Creator in general. Basically that’s what tuning is.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">You’re trying to tune to the vibration that created all that there is, which is love, unconditional love. You’re just tuning your instrument and trying to get it closer to that vibration that is the Creator, so that when He sings through you it will be melodic and it will be helpful to people, because they’ll just be glad that there is a good vibration around. It’s not necessarily what you say but more or less what you bring to saying it. I tune all the time.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I was telling Wynn before we came on the air that when my beloved companion, Don Elkins, was alive, before 1984, when we had a meditation group, he allowed three ways of tuning. We could “</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Om</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">” together, we could sing together or listen to music, and the third way was, we could tell jokes.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The idea, of course, was to get everybody in the circle—who might have come from anywhere on the globe or across town, but from separate lives—into one group that was a circle of seeking, that could focus together and bring in the highest and best station that you could hope for from that group, and get the best information and inspiration. So it was very specific tuning for blending and allowing the harmonics of our auras to flower and welcome each other.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">We can do that on the air. It doesn’t matter where we are. We can do it here on the radio as much as we can do it in the room together—except we don’t have all those visual aids that are so helpful. But I can feel it and I think most people can.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">You know, what you’re saying I do [on] almost every one of these shows. I do this meditation, or invocation to the light. I started this experimentally. I didn’t know if it would work, but I’ve had many conversations with these guys. I’ve learned that, either we being out [there with them] or they being [in here within us], that we can touch each other energetically. See, even when I just say that I feel the energy shift.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Yes. So you allow whatever is true of that thought to resonate and it gradually becomes your creation. We have this thing in common. I think it’s so important, and not just when we’re on the air, because we’re always “on the air”. Don’t you sometimes feel that there is a camera following you? Sometimes things are so priceless, I’ll look over my shoulder and say, “Did you get that?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Anyway, do you want to do the tuning? Do you want to sing this song? I think it’s a good one? You don’t have to join in unless you just want to. Everybody can join in if you want.</span></p>

You know, at one point I had discovered some of my past lives and I was fairly certain that it was accurate because all the pictures matched and all the other people in my life matched, and so I asked the question. Terry is so shy and so pure, and she’ll be in a room and change the energy of a room, and no one will even know she’s doing it because she does it so quietly.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Everyone is always glad to see Terry, I’ll bet.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Yes. Much more than me, because I just catalyze everybody. So I asked them, “Was Terry ever anybody famous?” Normally they don’t answer that, because people will take it into their ego and it wouldn’t be good to know that. But in Terry’s case they answered it because I think they knew that she would be more confident if she realized who she had been in a past life. So they said, “Look up St. Catherine of </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Siena</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">.” I’d never heard of St. Catherine. I found a picture of St. Catherine and Terry was the spitting image of her. If you don’t know who St. Catherine was, I just started reading about her. She lived in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Italy</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> in the 1300’s. She would go to the local monastery and she would start blabbing and the other people in the monastery would write down everything she said because they thought God was speaking through her.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="http://www.llresearch.org/interviews/interview_2009_0921.aspx#_ftn2"><span style="mso-bookmark: _ftnref2;"><span style="color: #cc00cc;">[2]</span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: _ftnref2;"></span></a></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">St. Catherine’s dialogues with God are still a part of [Roman] Catholic history and they’re outselling my book! Terry says she wants to go back and edit it.</span></p>

At any rate, she was a most blessed one and a martyred one also. But you know, you leave your works behind you, don’t you?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Yes. You know, when you tell a story like that it’s not to exalt somebody or go “Ooh! Ah!” For many people I think this channeling stuff is so far out, [since] it’s hard to believe that intelligence can come through somebody. And when you have a case like Terry, or David Wilcock, where you can show the amazing connections between lifetimes, the advantage of that, for somebody who is skeptical, [is that] it’s hard for them to put that aside. Because they look at the pictures and they look at the personality and they read about it, and there’s a congruency.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The hardest thing is to get through people’s doubts. It’s amazing that no matter how clear it is that something is real [to you, it is not clear to others.] Carla, you channel once a week. You have people over. You bring through [material]. If you’ve never read Carla’s channelings, we read them every Tuesday night on our conference line. Carla has thousands of them up on her website. When this is happening, it’s almost like someone who lives in a beautiful city. [He] forgets that he is in a beautiful city because he takes it for granted. But in this realm it’s extremely special to be able just to even know that that exists, that you can go searching [for it]. There is such a wealth of understanding. How many channelings to do have up, Carla?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">About a year ago, my webmaster said that it was over 1,500. Each one is somewhere between one and two hours long.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">And I would say you’re channelings are quite different from [those of] most other people that channel, both your Q’uo channelings and your Ra channelings. They’re different in their specificity. There’s such a wealth of information available. People ask Carla any question under the sun!</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Well, as long as it has to do with spiritual principles. They don’t talk much if somebody asks them, “Where should I go for my next appointment,” or, “When’s the next earthquake.” They’ll just say they’re not much interested in that. But, anything about spiritual principles, they’ll tackle. I’ve been surprised at how flexible they are. As long as you ask for the spiritual principles involved in thinking about such and such, you can ask about anything.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I’m amazed all of the time.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It’s been a blessing. Lately I’ve been editing an old manuscript I created in 1975.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="http://www.llresearch.org/interviews/interview_2009_0921.aspx#_ftn3"><span style="mso-bookmark: _ftnref3;"><span style="color: #cc00cc;">[3]</span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: _ftnref3;"></span></a><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>At that time, Don Elkins was the senior channel in a circle that was teaching a group of us to channel, but I was the one around whom he formed the circle. I knew that, and I was doing my best to learn to channel. It didn’t come naturally to me. I had to work at it. And once I got it, then it did come naturally to me. I had a lot of things that I could use, but it was just tough.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">During this time Don began taping our sessions for the first time. We just hadn’t done it before. And before we wrote<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-family: Arial;">Secrets of the UFO</span></i><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>in 1976, we decided that maybe the thing to do, since we hadn’t been able to sell the novel that we had written, and which was the first way that we tried to talk about the Confederation, [we would] take our channeling [sessions] and cut them up into pieces [by topic]. Back then you couldn’t cut and paste, since there were no computers. You had to do it with scissors and paste, actually cut up the sessions.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I sorted them out into [subjects such as] life, polarity, love, and truth. I just sorted them out into all these little bundles. Then I sorted the bundles into chapters, and for each category I would select a little quote. Then I would make a little comment and then have [the collection] of these selections from the sessions on that subject, so you could really get what the Confederation was trying to say. It’s about a 200-page manuscript. We just dug it up! I had forgotten about it. We never went back to it after [we wrote].<span class="apple-converted-space"><i>&nbsp;</i></span>We started to try to make a movie instead.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Now Don had grandiloquently called it<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-family: Arial;">Voices of the Gods</span></i><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>because of Erick von Danikaan’s<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-family: Arial;">Something, Something of the Gods</span></i><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>series.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Yes. It was a punk idea and when I resurrected it—and it really is fun—I renamed it<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-family: Arial;">Voices of the Confederation</span></i>, which has the virtue of being true. And I have had such a wonderful time rereading Don’s channeling. Nobody ever channeled just like him. It was so clear. He’d build one concept on another, taking little baby steps and building on a concept.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Don could channel? I didn’t know Don could channel.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Don and everybody in the original group, learned to channel except me. I was the holdout. That was way back 12 years before I learned to channel.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="http://www.llresearch.org/interviews/interview_2009_0921.aspx#_ftn4"><span style="mso-bookmark: _ftnref4;"><span style="color: #cc00cc;">[4]</span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: _ftnref4;"></span></a></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">For people that are listening that don’t know about your history, let me just tell them that in 1981 Carla Rueckert started channeling a voice that identified itself as Ra. I don’t think [she knew that] at the time, but this was a very rare and special thing, in this realm, for someone to bring through the Ra group.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But you know who did? Don did! In that very first session, he asked if he could make a book out of this conversation. Anyway, go right ahead, Wynn.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">So, for four years, she was bringing through this most extraordinary communication from this group-soul entity that was sharing how we looked, in an evolutionary way, from their perspective. They were explaining the way that the universe evolves. I don’t think I ever heard it from anyone before. And that was that someone in this realm, in third density, goes through many, many lifetimes, thousands of lifetimes sometimes. And they have this potential to graduate from this realm [if] they’ve mastered the lessons from this realm, in which case they don’t have to incarnate back into this realm. And when they graduate, there’s free will. So there are a lot of choices.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Apparently, there are happier planets. There are easier planets. God knows I can’t even imagine the choices! But one of the choices is to join this huge group-soul that helps planetary populations in third density go through their graduation process. This group-soul is explaining that they hoped to help them to graduate. This group-soul was talking through Carla and identified itself as the Ra Group.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I don’t know if you take this to be true, but I have this idea that the Ra group has worked hand in hand with almost every positive religion, spiritual movement, all the New Testament [energies], and has been connected with all of that and is working with trying to bring the information that would be able to be received for this time period.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">We asked the question about St. Catherine [to the Elohim], and who [Terry] was channeling. I went back and read her channelings, and the information that came through said it was the Ra group, that they were bringing through this amazing wisdom through St. Catherine but it was, it had to be, under the framework of strict Christianity because St. Catherine was going to a church. If it wasn’t under that framework, it wouldn’t have been acceptable.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">She wouldn’t have been able to get it—she wasn’t on that station.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Wynn:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Right. So you, [Carla,] never said this directly, I don’t remember reading your take on this. But if you read the Ra Material, they said in so many words that that was who they were and essentially, because Carla was so articulate, [and because L/L Research] was such a highly intelligent group they could bring through information with far less distortion.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Carla:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I think that’s true in [rough] language, but I think what really helped us bring through the Ra group was the purity of our seeking. We had joined [together to serve], and each of us had to make quite a few sacrifices in order to join, but we knew that we needed to have the three of us in order to serve and Jim wanted to join. I had become unable to type—typewriters were much harder to use than the keyboards of today—and I was sidelined from doing any more work. We needed somebody who could manifest [work]. Jim came in, as Ra always called him, as the “Scribe,” but we were three very imperfect and flawed people, as we all are, but with such a united desire to serve that I think we just had a good radio. We were able to tune in that station. And it is a blessing that one of the many gifts I had discovered that feeds into the channeling is a love of literature, a lot of reading. The more you read, whether it’s technical or not, the more words you have in your brain the more they can use. And [there are] other things too. I used to be a performer when I was a child and there is a certain element of performing in there, where you really like an audience, so nervousness never gets in my way. I just love feeling the love back from people and giving the love to them. I love an audience.</span></p>
