<p>Alright, this is Wednesday, <span style="font-size: medium;">September 28</span> and this is our question</p>
<p>and answer call.</p>
<p>We were just having a conversation before you guys joined us we</p>
<p>were having a conversation and Gjis said, Wynn is getting good,</p>
<p>we should start the tape recorder. I never like to start the tape</p>
<p>recorder because someone might think I am being the performer and</p>
<p>before that I was just being the BS'er. (laughs). You don't have</p>
<p>the responsibility of having a lot of unknown faces listening to</p>
<p>you. One of the things when I first started doing these calls, I</p>
<p>said, I had better be careful what I say. People are going to</p>
<p>quote me and I am going to be all over the internet and people</p>
<p>are going to say, Wynn said this and Wynn said that and that was</p>
<p>a little bit of fear consciousness but it was also a bit of</p>
<p>learning consciousness. Is Anna still on the line?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong> Yes. Now do you feel less self consciousness knowing all</p>
<p>those people are going to be listening to you? You don't feel so</p>
<p>lonely now?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong> I don't feel so lonely now.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> We are all going to beam Anna love and all our Sources on</p>
<p>the other side.</p>
<p>Anna, are you open to receive?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong> Oh yeah, I'll be beaming up to heaven?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> We are just going to be silent and focus love energy into</p>
<p>her heart and her whole body. (silence on line)</p>
<p>Ok, Anna you are going to send it back to us now?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong>&nbsp;Ok</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> If anyone could tell others how to let go of our patterns</p>
<p>and how to be a new person and they could switch people around</p>
<p>that easy, the world would be a different place. But these</p>
<p>patterns are so deep. I have learned about some of the people I</p>
<p>was in past lives and some of those around me and studied the</p>
<p>people they were and their personalities and it just blows me</p>
<p>away how similar they are now to what they are then. Maybe they</p>
<p>were famous then and they are not famous now but their</p>
<p>mannerisms, their habits, their intelligence, their sense of</p>
<p>humor, etc. Basically you would think you were a new person in</p>
<p>each new life but you are not. It's as strong as David Wilcock</p>
<p>and Edgar Casey. For example, there was a man named Harmon Bro</p>
<p>who wrote about 4 books about Cayce and he lived in the Casey</p>
<p>household. He was a very sharp guy and he experienced Edgar Cayce</p>
<p>firsthand, and he kept saying how Cayce kind of resented being a</p>
<p>channel and people coming over and saying, ok, now go to sleep.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself in that position. He felt that his own self</p>
<p>expression was contracted and if you have watched David Wilcock,</p>
<p>it was me who convinced him that this book would be very</p>
<p>important and that his channelings are important. Right now he</p>
<p>does not present himself to the world as a channel. When I met</p>
<p>him he was being a scientific intuitive and he was probably right</p>
<p>that he could reach more people in being a scientific intuitive</p>
<p>than being Edgar Cayce. He has a New York Times best seller</p>
<p>called Source Field Investigations where he puts together all</p>
<p>these historical prophecies and tries to indicate that we are in</p>
<p>the middle of a shift. He didn't want to be known as a channel.</p>
<p>No one wants to be known as a channel because people think you</p>
<p>know all the answers. The reason we are getting away doing this</p>
<p>is because I have figured this out. I learned over time that I</p>
<p>was creating a very valuable function in the manner I was doing</p>
<p>this. I may not channel but I hold an expanded hologram. When you</p>
<p>do that, how do you know you are doing that? You are just weird.</p>
<p>You see things others don't see and so the expanded hologram to</p>
<p>hold a safe space for someone who channels can be in that space</p>
<p>and bring through verbal messages, but that space holds the</p>
<p>energy of those beings and the message is on top of the energy.</p>
<p>So I have the ability to hold the space, but I didn't know I had</p>
<p>it. I just knew that I didn't fit and everything was boring and I</p>
<p>imagine that over many lifetimes I have done all these things and</p>
<p>so they are not interesting. Ra said in one of my night readings,</p>
<p>“you finally have found a job that you don't get tired of.”</p>
<p>Because of all of that experience it allows me to hold the energy</p>
<p>in a very human way. On one hand, it's sacred and on the other</p>
<p>hand it's very human and bridging from the sacredness to the</p>
<p>humanness. In fact and we have a question about that tonight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some years ago I would not believe I was good enough to do this.</p>
<p>When we started putting this out I just wanted to stay behind the</p>
<p>scenes but it's evolved since then.</p>
<p>Everyone here is worthy of love. So let's go into this now. Terry</p>
<p>are you ready?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Terry:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> (Wynn calls in the light)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> We wait for our Sources to identify themselves and become</p>
<p>present.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you. As we approach the end of September, the</p>
<p>configuration of energies have changed. This is Ra'An and we</p>
<p>greet each and every one of you in the love light of the One</p>
<p>Infinite Creator. We are delighted for this opportunity to make</p>
<p>contract with each and every one of you, whether you listen to</p>
<p>the call live or whether you listen to an audio, or read the</p>
<p>transcript. We are pleased to make contact. Even if you read a</p>
<p>transcript, the energy; the frequencies come through and in the</p>
<p>book, The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce in part two, the</p>
<p>frequencies of Ra come through in that and there is an aura about</p>
<p>the book and in David's new book there is an aura about the book,</p>
<p>about the Source Field and it is a wonderful way to connect to</p>
<p>the energy, to read these materials and listen to the replay line</p>
<p>and to listen to the live calls and to also listen to replays of</p>
<p>some of David's talks also. We ask if you have questions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Yes we do have questions. Thank you.</p>
<p>Edna has a pretty good question about the creation of events.</p>
<p>Here we are on earth and we are tumbled around with events,</p>
<p>seemingly unconnected, although some of us have had</p>
<p>synchronicities and some of us have have experiences that what</p>
<p>seems like random events may not be so random. This says, we have</p>
<p>new events for every moment and do we affect everything at every</p>
<p>moment? Then she had a dream that she was changing the</p>
<p>mathematical formula for the creation of certain events and the</p>
<p>question is, am I really doing it?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you for your question. Everything is in the now and</p>
<p>is created in the now and individuals do not generally have a</p>
<p>clear understanding that they are affecting their surroundings at</p>
<p>every moment. At a very deep level, they are setting a course,</p>
<p>they are making agreements that are coming about, so as you move</p>
<p>into your thought divining soft formula, yes you are actually</p>
<p>changing events, but also know that this is a free will zone and</p>
<p>there is a consensus reality, so this is all taken into</p>
<p>consideration in outcomes and also, there is an outcome that for</p>
<p>as far as learning goes will be most beneficial and have the most</p>
<p>fulfillment for you. These interconnected workings of you and</p>
<p>relationships to the consciousness of others and the path of All</p>
<p>That Is in connection, come into play, as you move through this</p>
<p>series of events in a way that gives you optimum growth. It is</p>
<p>not always the easy road or the pleasant road but it is the road</p>
<p>that gives you much growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p>This is a question from George in Australia. When sitting for the</p>
<p>purpose of attuning to God's pure light energy; breathing and</p>
<p>visually drawing the energy into one's being, does the energy</p>
<p>immediately qualify to a positive or negative state depending</p>
<p>upon the spiritual attunement of the sitter? In other words, will</p>
<p>God's pure light energy be just as effective as flowing through a</p>
<p>dirty pipeline, a person who chooses to dwell on the obscene</p>
<p>level in him or herself, one who has the ability to channel the</p>
<p>energy?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> As one is in the 3rd dimension has taken on the coloration</p>
<p>of the 3rd dimension through the body, the minerals of the body,</p>
<p>through the mind and the through the connections that the mind</p>
<p>has made that are coming to play in their own life, then this can</p>
<p>skew the individuals path in the direction of that mindset. So if</p>
<p>an individual is thinking on board, in himself and resonating</p>
<p>with frequencies of a lower nature then this will connect him or</p>
<p>her up with surroundings that are of the fabric that make up</p>
<p>these frequencies and of the nature that they are looking at.</p>
<p>Intent has something to do with this as someone may have an</p>
<p>obscene sense of humor but may be releasing tension in other</p>
<p>people and they may then are moving through the obscenities and</p>
<p>releasing built up areas within a person and allowing people to</p>
<p>move through it. It depends upon the circumstance of the</p>
<p>individual. There is not a given rule except that if an</p>
<p>individual is connecting with frequencies that can be</p>
<p>disconnecting in nature and they are not going through it for the</p>
<p>purpose of moving through it, and then connecting, then it can</p>
<p>remove one further from God's path or their own path in</p>
<p>connection with Spirit or All That Is.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p>A question came up in my mind and that is, if one studies</p>
<p>spiritual practices through the history of human kind, there is</p>
<p>one kind of practice that for example the Buddhists ascribe to</p>
<p>that attains to getting rid of desires and to become spiritual</p>
<p>one must release desire and they spend a long time to be able to</p>
<p>do that. Then there is another practice that says that desire is</p>
<p>part of the human side and it's learning how to work through the</p>
<p>desires. Someone said, it is through need we create, and so when</p>
<p>we have no more desire, we have no more need to create. It is ok</p>
<p>to need and through our need we would learn.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p>When an individual has a need then the individual can feel the</p>
<p>need, for example the need to communicate or the need to eat or</p>
<p>to get angry. There are certain functions a body takes on by</p>
<p>being in the physical realm such as the reaction to danger. If a</p>
<p>person sets out to eliminate all need and desires, the question</p>
<p>is, is the person merely shoving these desires and needs under</p>
<p>the rug so they are not seen and this may further disconnect them</p>
<p>so one have to be careful when trying to control the system.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better way is to observe and to see what it is. Perhaps</p>
<p>a person is sitting on a pin they would have to move. This is an</p>
<p>early warning system that there is something that needs to be</p>
<p>done. A child may have to communicate by throwing tantrums to let</p>
<p>the parent know there is something that is needed until they can</p>
<p>get the communication system. Therefore communication is very</p>
<p>important in working with an individual's needs until they can</p>
<p>get to an age where they can communicate. Therefore communication</p>
<p>is very important in working with an individual's needs. They</p>
<p>should be given the opportunity to express what their needs are,</p>
<p>so they can learn to work with them instead of suppressing them</p>
<p>out of existence. When one gets to the point where they can</p>
<p>become aware they are a child of the higher forces then they can</p>
<p>move with that in mind and they can non-linearly connect to both</p>
<p>sides and become more the master of these needs. This places them</p>
<p>in the light of the higher vision and puts them in perspective</p>
<p>when they have the higher vision and therefore they can control</p>
<p>these needs and desires and temper them so this is not a</p>
<p>suppressing of the needs but looking at them from the higher</p>
<p>aspects.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Next question. We have some healing requests. Zoyie was asking</p>
<p>for some healing for her back. Also healing for Carol Sabin.</p>
<p>Zoyie is having swelling in her back, pressing on the sciatic</p>
<p>nerve, causes pain when she walks and at night at well. Are there</p>
<p>any recommendations for those issues?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> There is a disconnection in the flow of energy. There is a</p>
<p>build up in the lymph. We see that the kidneys need to be</p>
<p>cleared. We also see a misalignment in the area. We will continue</p>
<p>to look at this. We also see such healing such as echinacea.</p>
<p>Something to clear the kidneys. Drink enough liquids to help</p>
<p>clear this out. You might also give a call to one of Dr.</p>
<p>Marshall's assistants and ask if there is a formulation. They</p>
<p>have a formulation of herbs that help the kidney's clear. Discuss</p>
<p>your symptoms with them and see if something is needed to pick up</p>
<p>the activity of the adrenal gland. Whenever there is pain then</p>
<p>the level of the electrical potential in the areas is lower. The</p>
<p>raising of the electrical potential is needed so this part can</p>
<p>heal. We see a blockage in the flow of energy. We take that under</p>
<p>consideration.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> I do not like to ask those types of questions. It borders</p>
<p>on an area we are looking at someone's body and tell them what is</p>
<p>wrong with them. This is for entertainment value and if you want</p>
<p>to, check it out go to your own health professional. Zoyie</p>
<p>understands the nature of what we are doing and is running this</p>
<p>by her own scrutiny.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to close out this call and ask a general question about</p>
<p>the galactic dark night of the soul that Daphne and others are</p>
<p>talking about. Let's have just an overview of this question where</p>
<p>anything might happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p>These are very difficult astrologically right now. The vocabulary</p>
<p>of this channel is very limited. Bringing up the shortest days</p>
<p>and the days gets shorter and the sun changes in amounts as you</p>
<p>near the galactic equator, then the energy upon the sun</p>
<p>intensifies and it puts the sun under intense pressure which has</p>
<p>created a solar flare minimum that were suppressed and now as</p>
<p>your planet nears the galactic equator, the solar flares are</p>
<p>beginning to erupt which can place extreme pressure and make</p>
<p>energy streams, can make the northern light, the passage of</p>
<p>particles into your sphere which have been shot out by the sun</p>
<p>can put some of your satellites in harm's way and make pressure</p>
<p>upon earth and in turn can increase earthquake frequency and</p>
<p>magnitudes.</p>
<p>The attraction of the particles in alignments gives different</p>
<p>spins to the particles within earth's sphere creating different</p>
<p>alignments and different frequency fields which is disconcerting</p>
<p>to some and cause tempers to flare and the influence of some</p>
<p>negativity can be more pronounced within the earth's sphere,</p>
<p>negativity can have more of a hold in a period like that.</p>
<p>Everything is magnified so that if the individual can overcome it</p>
<p>and come through it, they can have more intense emotions and have</p>
<p>more progress and more growth telepathically and be more gifted</p>
<p>at such a time. Be careful when traveling in such periods as this</p>
<p>moving in through October. Keep with moving in with the grid</p>
<p>healing as this can help anchor the energies into the higher</p>
<p>tone.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Last Wednesday we had a special event with myself and Terry</p>
<p>and Daphne on the line and it felt like the energies were very</p>
<p>powerful. Was there a special, unique interaction of the three of</p>
<p>us that brought in extremely high frequencies on that call?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes, particularly Daphne with your support was able was</p>
<p>able to bring in a whole level of higher energy into the sphere</p>
<p>to the callers and those opened to those frequencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> So we all opened up to those holograms during that call. I</p>
<p>would like to draw a conclusion from that has an exceptional</p>
<p>healing power on the planet, correct?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes and no in that there are other influences you might</p>
<p>say that are influencing things and it did raise the level of</p>
<p>those who were open for it to be raised.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Is that a valuable energy to bring in on our grid healing</p>
<p>on Sunday's?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Since Daphne brought up Elenin up in her channeled I</p>
<p>thought I would ask again.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes it is at a close approach to earth right now but it is</p>
<p>not going to hit earth. We look at they energies at this time. It</p>
<p>is a small comet. We do not see that it will be having any</p>
<p>significant affect on earth. One thing the comet is doing is</p>
<p>moving between the earth and the sun which cuts through some of</p>
<p>the energy flow with the sun which may release some of the</p>
<p>pressure that has been brought to bare on the sun by being in the</p>
<p>vicinity of the galactic equator, which then can in it's relaxing</p>
<p>of pressure for a short time can trigger some solar flares. We do</p>
<p>not see three days of darkness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you very much. I am just going through a few more</p>
<p>healings and we are not going to ask to get comments on them just</p>
<p>to send love and light. Tamara Harbor is sending light to her cat</p>
<p>who was suffering named Fred who departed. Then Fred Bell in</p>
<p>Laguna Beach one of the founders of BBS who passed over.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes, we send light to Fred the cat and it was Fred Bell's</p>
<p>time to go.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> I think that is all we can do tonight. Thank you all for</p>
<p>supported me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We send love light to Zoi's condition and we offer</p>
<p>connection at all times. We are here and we leave but do not</p>
<p>leave. Adonai</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you all for being here.</p>
