<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Wynn:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">This is Valentine’s Day, Monday February 14<sup>th</sup>, [2011] and it is a simulcast between a conference call and an internet broadcast system.<span>&nbsp; </span>This call is one of the first calls we ever did, and it evolved fairly slowly. It started out as a conference call; and when we decided to try it – the thing about this call that we were learning when we were doing it as a conference call is that we could actually make connections with higher dimensions while we were on the call.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some people noticed it, and some people didn’t and some people noticed it after a couple of months.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was an energy that could be felt on the line and of course, we’re channeling and we’re talking to sources and they said that energy was them and that they could project into this realm but they needed, the way they described it, receivers – they needed people that were able to tune to their frequency.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we started tuning to their frequency.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">It started out with just myself and Terry or myself and Daphne and we were talking to them.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I say tuning to a frequency, that may sound a little mysterious the first time you hear it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everyone knows what it means to be on a radio.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everyone knows – say for example when your son comes home or your husband comes home – you suddenly feel differently.<span>&nbsp; </span>At that moment, you are tuning to their frequency.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s what it means.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not such a big, unusual thing, except that tuning to the frequency of an intelligence that’s outside of this realm is harder.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Gjis:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>Wynn, will you please put a little distance on the microphone?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Wynn:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>You know my headset was not working right – thank you.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s my producer, Gjis, making sure I do everything right.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you, Gjis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">On this call, just by the nature of them talking to us, their frequency is on the call.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may notice when they’re on the call that it feels like you’re with old friends.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not me, it’s not the people on the call on the one hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it is me and it is the people on the call because it’s all one.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, when you start tuning into the energy of the oneness, then your life starts to change because everything you see, do, and run across – is an expression of yourself, part of yourself.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s when the magic happens.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">You can’t get there by thinking it or acting it.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s got to be a flow; but one of the things we’re doing is we’re setting up a reference point on these calls.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can take it as your own experiment.<span>&nbsp; </span>See if you listen for a couple of months if something in you shifts, if you start to tune into the frequency of oneness.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not entertainment; it’s like a slow-burn, it’s like a shift in your own dimensional awareness.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s hard to make someone understand it until they experience it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">All I can say is that many people who have been on this call have emailed me and said they felt it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know I can feel it, I can feel when the energy starts to come in.<span>&nbsp; </span>Did you notice right then, some of your noticed – there’s a slight shift in energy?<span>&nbsp; </span>Usually I can tell if the energy comes in when I stop talking and the energy continues.<span>&nbsp; </span>Right at the beginning of the show if I stopped talking it would have felt empty, awkward.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I stop talking now - feel the space.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now in that space there are a multitude of things going on.<span>&nbsp; </span>We don’t really perceive all of it except in the space.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Wynn:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>Okay.<span>&nbsp; </span>The archives of these shows are pretty amazing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those of you who have been listening, all the archives are available in BBS but they’re not very well labeled.<span>&nbsp; </span>Last week’s show was particularly interesting, because we talked about what happens when you die.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s something that everyone should have some interest in because it’s all going to be part of our experience in this realm.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re talking to a source that you can trust you might get some insight scoop on what to do when your body drops.<span>&nbsp; </span>That was last week and the week before--two calls on dying.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">I picked a topic this week, which I thought was an interesting topic, and it has to do with the internet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">We are all in a position of making connections or trying to make connections, or trying to make real connections.<span>&nbsp; </span>Real connections don’t have agendas, they don’t have manipulations – they’re just, “Hi it’s nice that you’re there.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s nice that I’m here.”<span>&nbsp; </span>We enjoy each other’s beings.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you have a couple of people that you have real connections with in your life you can feel them in your space.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you have superficial connections with people, or – I’m not judging this, or saying it’s wrong or it’s superficial – for example: <span>&nbsp;</span>if you go to work and you have comrades at work and you’re very friendly with them but then you go home you can’t feel them in your space.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you go to work, can you feel your wife and kids in your space while you’re at work?<span>&nbsp; </span>Who can you feel in that space?<span>&nbsp; </span>Those are the people you have connections with. Those are people that are sustaining your energy.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Sometimes you don’t even have to know people to feel them in your space.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes somebody like Johnny Carson on TV - I think that anyone who watched Johnny Carson felt him, could feel his presence.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even though he didn’t necessarily consciously feel your presence, on some level he was able to feel the presence of his audience.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s one of the reasons he was so successful because if you listen to him, you felt <strong>“felt”.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">So we all want to have people like that in our lives.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope that we can create that here on these calls where – and I think we are, because we get emails from people that I don’t know on a personal level who are feeling the energies.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re one of those and you never emailed me, emailed us – I really would appreciate it because it helps me validate what we’re doing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m not doing this because I need to be “out there”, I’m doing it because I think it’s helping people and I think it could help a lot of people and that’s the goal.<span>&nbsp; </span>For that to occur, we have to feel each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>Notice the space.<span>&nbsp; </span>So in that space is you and me as energies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">And it’s also our sources, I call them our sources – our source of information, sources of energy, they are present.<span>&nbsp; </span>They say they’re present on the line.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unlike you and me, we have bodies, you hear my voice.<span>&nbsp; </span>They don’t have bodies but they talk through Terry.<span>&nbsp; </span>Every Monday we come up with a topic and this week--now I may not stick to this but I wanted to talk about the internet.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the internet was first coming out many, many people, including me, were thinking: “Oh my god! <span>&nbsp;</span>No more privacy.”<span>&nbsp; </span>When the computers were coming out: no more privacy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anyone could scan records, find anything – in microseconds where in the past it would have taken sometimes days to find information.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">So on one hand, all of us are more vulnerable because of the internet.<span>&nbsp; </span>I should say most of us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of you have managed to keep off of the internet and your name never shows up but most people show up.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course we know there are negative forces out there and we can assume the negative is using the internet as part of their agenda to try to control people, to find people, to do whatever they do with the internet.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then there are a huge of amount of spiritual things on the internet, on YouTube and people are finding those things.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Then there are a huge amount of “conspiracy things” – although I don’t think it’s conspiracy in many cases I think it’s the way things actually happened – but, there’s many ways to find out some of motivations and inside agendas that are occurring on our planet that you wouldn’t find in mainstream media or the newspapers<span>&nbsp; </span>If you subscribe to the Wynn channel – that’s <a href="http://thewynnchannel.messageaday.net/" target="_blank">thewynnchannel.messageaday.net</a> – I occasionally put some of those things up for your consideration.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">A few months ago one of the most remarkable things that came through a channeling with Daphne had to do with Facebook and how Facebook – I didn’t ask this, they just mentioned it – Facebook was having a huge impact in the balance of power between the positive and the negative.<span>&nbsp; </span>The reason was, Facebook was – this is my take--we’re going to ask some questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think we’ve been understanding this – all of your may understand a little more how to connect with energies, whether you go on Facebook or not.<span>&nbsp; </span>My take on Facebook was that it was providing an opportunity for people to connect without agendas.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like “Hi, how’re you doing?<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m here now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Good to hear from you.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">That doesn’t mean everyone on Facebook doesn’t have an agenda, I’m sure that’s not true.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m sure there are people that want to sell things, people want attention, people want to get a million friends, they want to brag.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, within the basic nature of Facebook are people connecting just for the heck of connecting.<span>&nbsp; </span>People are connecting to old people that had dropped out of their lives and they’re finding them.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s giving that connection in the spaces for the people that are working it.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s my take.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the whole games here is getting energy into that space, getting into the space where you stop [and] the energy is still present.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
