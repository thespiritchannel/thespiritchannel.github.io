<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Welcome to our Sunday Grid healing this is August 7, 2011. <br /><br /><strong>Wynn’s introduction-</strong> Just as a little bit of an alert, we did a<br />session with Daphne and the indications are, according to this<br />session, we are in for a fairly big economic downturn.&nbsp; It is<br />already turning with inflation and there is a possibility of food<br />prices going up.&nbsp; I'm not saying this is true and it's not meant<br />to alarm you, but it is better to be forewarned.&nbsp; There is a<br />chance of food prices going up in the cities in particular<br />300-500%.&nbsp; If I lived in the city I'd buy a bunch of canned food<br />and some water just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I recommend that.&nbsp; No harm and<br />it will last for years and sooner or later you will probably be<br />glad you did it.<br />&nbsp;<br />I think we have some new people on the call today.&nbsp; This is a<br />very unusual call as two things happen simultaneously.&nbsp; One<br />reality is you are listening to my voice and I'm saying words and<br />language and you are interpreting the language in your brain and<br />taking it in.&nbsp; The other reality is that we have these group<br />souls that I have been in communication with that say they are on<br />this line.&nbsp; They don't have voices but they can speak through<br />Terry. But they do have energies, and through the course of this<br />call, many, many people have reported that they have felt the<br />energies on the line.&nbsp; Feeling energies could be looked at as a<br />phenomenon but there is also something about it that is very<br />beneficial to feel the energies of other positive dimensions.&nbsp; It<br />is beneficial because in the universe it is all one.&nbsp; We are<br />them, they are us.&nbsp; When we feel the energies, we start to make<br />contact with the higher aspect of ourselves.&nbsp; That allows a lot<br />of things to occur that wouldn't happen otherwise.&nbsp; For example,<br />healings.&nbsp; For example, the ability to create group intentions<br />and transform something in the world.&nbsp; Whenever we do this we<br />have the stipulations, for the highest good of all concerned, and<br />honoring free will.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Sunday call is special in the sense that it is focused on the<br />energy.&nbsp; It's not focused on information, or understanding the<br />history of interdimensional connection in this realm.&nbsp; It's not<br />focused on the questions you submit.&nbsp; We do that on Mondays and<br />Wednesdays.&nbsp; It is focused on the energy and connecting with the<br />energies.&nbsp; And it's focused on personal and planetary healing. <br />When we put things in the light, we don't really emphasize<br />personal healings although there will be a place in the call<br />where you can silently work on healing with yourself and anyone<br />else.&nbsp; This is a long call (1 and ½ hours) and if I don't create<br />some restrictions it could be a 2 1/2 hour call.&nbsp; I appreciate<br />everyone’s understanding.<br /><br />One thing about both Terry and Daphne in their own unique ways<br />that when they are doing the channelings, it sounds like there is<br />a voice coming through them.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that it<br />is more than that.&nbsp; They are actually holographically connecting<br />with energies. There are little shifts when it’s easy to get<br />spaced out or distracted.&nbsp; Even I do that.&nbsp; When I'm on the call<br />here, I feel like it connects everybody, they connect with us and<br />we connect with them and then when Terry comes in to channel she<br />just moves into that field.&nbsp; That is why it is important, that<br />co-creation, as it's not like they are just talking to us, they<br />are connecting with us.<br /><br /><strong>Terry</strong>:&nbsp; One of the things that happens is all of those energies<br />run through my hologramic body system, my matrix, and so it's not<br />just a voice coming through, its total perceptive like vision and<br />sound and where we are at.&nbsp; Some people might call it "remotely<br />viewed" and some of the issues we get into are really big things<br />and it takes a while to process that when we are off the call. <br />Both Daphne and I have that happen.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Do we have any requests at this time?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Gijs</strong> – Magalia , California : I'd like to ask for a loving<br />healing light to be sent to a stable supply and a reasonable<br />price for our consumables.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> By the way, they said, when they were saying that, this is<br />the way things look based on probability vortexes of how things<br />are right now and that nothing is locked in stone so it may not<br />happen but it’s not a bad idea to spend $100 in canned food so<br />if things break down you’ll have some regrouping time to make<br />sure your nourished.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Gina</strong>- O’ahu , Hawai’i :&nbsp; If there is going to be inflation<br />that the prices of food and goods don’t go very high and stay<br />stable and people are able to get themselves canned food and<br />water to store and be prepared. I also want to send peace, love<br />and happiness to everyone at this time and may we be nourished in<br />the Dolphin fun and love energy and Whale energy as well. Thank<br />you so much.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; By the way, the reason that things are going up<br />if it does happen, the situation that sets it up is:&nbsp; the<br />government was at one point able to borrow money, now when the<br />government needs money they print it and they just keep printing<br />more.&nbsp; The value of the money is only correlative to what people<br />believe it is but it has no back up.&nbsp; The other countries don’t<br />do that.&nbsp; So what happens is the value of the dollar in the world<br />market keeps going down because of the way the government prints<br />money.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you notice, we just went into all those wars in the<br />Middle East and the newspapers report that all the money was<br />spent, trillions of dollars supporting those wars, where did all<br />that money come from, it was just printed.&nbsp; So that’s the<br />problem.&nbsp; That’s why this is so in your face.&nbsp; It’s hard to<br />fix that when other countries stop valuing what you have.&nbsp; If<br />other countries diminish the value of the dollar then it means<br />things get more expensive, imports get more expensive.&nbsp; I don’t<br />know what all the repercussions could be of that but that’s the<br />problem.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Lori</strong> – San Carlos : That the supply and every good thing comes<br />to all those in need easily no matter what happens and all<br />discordant energies in the world are dissolved and consumed in<br />the power of the light into loving kindness.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Jim</strong> – Tomball, Texas:&nbsp; I would like to put the high-pressure<br />zone that is sitting on top of Texas in the light that it might<br />be lessened and allow moisture to come into the area.&nbsp; The people<br />and animals and plants are starting to get quite desperate here.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> There is a high-pressure air zone?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Jim:</strong> Yes, that’s sitting on top of the Texas area.&nbsp; It's been<br />here a long time now.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn</strong>: I've noticed that of all the things we ask for, the weather<br />requests seem to be the easiest because it doesn't seem to<br />violate anyone’s free will.&nbsp; So, keep us informed.<br />Jim:&nbsp; I hope it works.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ralph</strong>- Michigan: I wish everyone love and light and I wanted to<br />bring everyone who is accepting of the gift of the creator of<br />love into the light.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Marsha</strong>- LA : There’s an increasing amount of raids lately and<br />one in Venice on the Rawsome Foods and my friend James Stewart is<br />being accused of fraud and it's not true. I want to bring love<br />and light because it's taking away the freedom of choice for<br />food.&nbsp; I don't know how to word this, but what I'm thinking is<br />the big corporations like McDonalds; people eat that and nobody<br />arrests anyone for serving something that’s been in a closet<br />and hasn't decayed for a year. Yet, when they have these<br />beautiful farmers who don't hurt the animals opposite industrial<br />farming, those people are all being arrested. So I would like to<br />bring grace and love and light and synchronicities to turn this<br />thing inside out to where it belongs and also to support people<br />like my friend Jim Cole who are being put in prison for<br />manufacturing nutriceuticals that help many people. I'd like for<br />them to be vindicated and for our freedoms to be restored.&nbsp; We<br />should have our food choices restored. Then this sweet woman who<br />has children, she is a single mother and farmer.&nbsp; Her license was<br />taken away.&nbsp; She was supplying James.&nbsp; She has this gentle farm,<br />loving, beautiful care of her animals, nothing that hurts the<br />animals yet they took her license away.&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s out of control<br />what's going on.&nbsp; Yet they let these factory farms flourish where<br />they torture animals and fill us with chemicals that cause<br />cancer. <br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you Marsha nice to hear you this morning.<br /><br /><strong>Ann</strong>- Tahoe: I like to address the air and water as a form of our<br />consciousness within everything and add the love/light to it to<br />neutralize these negative energies that are coming out and to put<br />love/light into the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Evidently, recently they<br />passed a ruling in favor of an individual and states for their<br />own sovereignty and freedom and that the government doesn't have<br />a right to infringe upon that. I'd like to see that expanded out<br />into all the cases.&nbsp; That would be great.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Great. Thank you and next.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Joanna</strong> – Eureka: I'm not sure how to word this but I would like<br />the love/light to bring a balance between individual freedom, and<br />compassion, and community, that people are moved to share what<br />other people need, without feeling like it's an infringement on<br />individual rights or their individual needs and also that the<br />governments of the world have more compassion and stop cutting<br />programs for the poor and elderly and mentally ill.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Zoe</strong> – Sacramento:&nbsp; I'd like to ask for love/light for those in<br />Washington who are going to be taking the next step toward<br />figuring out the budget cuts etc. that there be a remarkable<br />spirit of cooperation and understanding, compassion and love<br />among all of them.&nbsp; And also that all of the people of the world<br />have all the provisions they need to continue their lives in a<br />healthy way.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Oren</strong> – Salt Lake: I'd like to ask that the moon and any other<br />mass control systems that are being used by the powers that want<br />to be, to influence mass hypnosis, etc. and various forms of<br />control over the population, be interrupted and interfered in<br />whatever synchronistic ways can be, any forms of control that are<br />taking away our sovereignty and free will of people on the<br />planet.&nbsp; Several people have said that the moon is being used by<br />negative E.T.’s to project certain forms of vibrations and<br />energetic thought controls, things like that, that maintain the<br />matrix.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Let's include the moon or any artificial means of inducing<br />thought forms into people’s minds that are not from the divine<br />or their own.&nbsp; Okay?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Zoe:</strong>&nbsp; That the moon be able to maintain its own sovereignty.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Michael</strong> – San Diego: I would like to put the energy of creative<br />inspiration into the light as we continue&nbsp; to download more and<br />more of our divinity, that we can embody this energy in creating<br />a new world, and freedom of speech, communication, and freedom of<br />the Internet as usual. Thank you.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Anyone else?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Marsha:</strong> There is a lot of talk about the comet Elenin and if<br />their is the&nbsp; possibility that it could impact or have any<br />negative effects on the Earth or anywhere, if there could be <br />synchronicities aligned with the highest good..<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> A question was already asked about that on our Wednesday<br />night call, and they said it was not going to impact the Earth in<br />that way, and I hope that's true, but just in case they were<br />wrong, we can ask that it be deflected.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Gina:</strong>&nbsp; Also planet Nibiru.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Yes.<br />&nbsp;<br />Michael: Yes, but we are going to build a giant toll-booth and<br />charge the comet and planet a fee for coming into this galaxy. <br />So that will fix the economy and we've got it made. ha ha.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Greg</strong> – Simi Valley : I would like to invite love/light to our<br />mass media system so that they turn over a new leaf and start<br />speaking the truth and what's really going on that's important<br />instead of trying to only report on negative things to put people<br />into fear and insecurity and start speaking the truth and<br />what’s important.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Very good. The negative controls the media and I hope that<br />shifts.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Edna</strong>: I'd like to put everyone's financial difficulties at this<br />time in the light.&nbsp; Those worried about their houses.&nbsp; I know of<br />people who are really having problems now and would really like<br />to put them in the light.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Carolyn</strong>- Davis:&nbsp; Countries that are having physical conflict so<br />that more lives can be saved.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> I wanted to make one comment, that Edna is helping to keep<br />team Shift coordinated and what team Shift is, is if you like how<br />we are talking now and feel comfortable hanging out with some<br />people that understand what's going on, Team Shift is small<br />groups of 3-5-6 people that meet every day.&nbsp; You don't have to be<br />there every day, but be there often.&nbsp; You get assigned to a<br />group, or you help pick a group and then every day you put things<br />in the light and you build a little community of people holding<br />the energy, so instead of just listening to me and Terry, you<br />learn that you can bring in the energy yourself and doing that<br />every day, or often has a great impact on your life.&nbsp; Many people<br />feel isolated and alienated in this shift and that no one knows<br />what's going on, so it's a group of people and it's free. It’s<br />only working because of people who are volunteering: Edna, Gary,<br />Bogdon, Gina, Suzanne, Connie who are doing transcripts.&nbsp; You can<br />go to <a href="http://www.teamshift.messageaday.net">www.teamshift.messageaday.net</a>.&nbsp; People who are participating in<br />Team Shift are reporting a profound shift for themselves because<br />you stop feeling so isolated and alienated because you have a<br />group of people and if you really get to be friends with those<br />people, if you are authentic, if something happens in your city<br />and you have to leave, you'll have some friends somewhere else<br />that might take you in, in an emergency.&nbsp; It's a good balance<br />over the next period of time since anything can happen. It's<br />another side benefit of doing it.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Lori</strong>- San Carlos: It's important to buy seeds, and no, not from<br />Monsanto.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn</strong>- (conducts the guided visualization)<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn</strong> (calls in the light) Father, Mother God we ask for the<br />presence of the light to surround and protect each person on this<br />call and any negativity be taken to the higher realms of light<br />and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see<br />ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the<br />galaxy, from the center of the universe, through our bodies, and<br />into the center of the earth.&nbsp; And right now we invoke a group<br />energy, a connecting of all our spirits while maintaining the<br />sovereign integrity of our souls and we invite those sources that<br />are positive and service to others, honoring the Law of One, to<br />join with us.&nbsp; We create a protective space only the positive has<br />access to, and anything not of that nature must leave now.<br /><br /><strong>Terry (RA' AN)</strong> This is RA’AN we greet each and every one of<br />you.&nbsp; This is August 7, 2011 in these times wherein there is<br />effect from the Star systems and configuration of planet's in the<br />solar system and Mercury is in retrograde, that we extend<br />love/light to each and every one of you on the call, who reads<br />the transcripts, who listens to the audio at a later time. <br />&nbsp;<br />We give our profound thanks to Gina, Connie, and Suzanne and any<br />transcribers who work to make the information available.&nbsp; We<br />suggest that each of you at this time install precautions in your<br />life, observation of your surroundings- your particular places<br />where you purchase things and you instill wisdom in your spending<br />of money, and your economic circumstances in putting some<br />provisions aside.&nbsp; This is always good even in very good economic<br />times to have a plan that a store of food can be laid in, in case<br />of some detriment to the supply or your ability. We suggest this<br />not as a disaster plan but as a way of life. That one can look<br />into the future and provide for your family and self and have<br />things available instead of on a day-to-day plan. <br />&nbsp;<br />We send love/light to all people who are working to support their<br />families and to maintain or to establish a healthy lifestyle and<br />healthy style of eating for themselves and their families. We<br />note that one of the major suppliers of raw food in the Venice/LA<br />area which extends into Los Angeles and Santa Monica and<br />surrounding cities has come under attack and we send love/light<br />to the people who are involved and all the people would purchase<br />food from Rawsome that there may be a resolution. We send love<br />light to James Stewart and to the suppliers to his facility in<br />Venice and all of the people who were relying upon his source for<br />raw healthy food.<br />&nbsp;<br />We further expand our view to look at the water in all of the<br />Earth. We send light/light and clearing and molecular vibrations<br />of love to all of the water supply whether it is in the oceans or<br />in an individual’s particular body. We take a look at<br />individuals and how much water you may be consuming, and we<br />suggest that if an individual does not have enough water it can<br />have profound effects upon the body's systems. If they have<br />enough water, this can also have a calming effect on individuals<br />and can make all the systems of the body flow better as the body<br />needs water for the operation of the whole body system.&nbsp;&nbsp; And<br />although an individual can still perhaps operate with less water,<br />it can hinder body functioning in ways since it is gradual or not<br />noticed.&nbsp; Many may have noticed as they get older they look more<br />dehydrated but proper water and proper fats within the diet can<br />fill in some of these areas and plump up areas someone may have<br />thought were because of age.&nbsp; Proper oils are also important for<br />the functioning of the body and lubrication of the individual<br />body parts.<br />&nbsp;<br />We then send love/light to all individual farmers who are<br />producing good products that a body can make good use of in its<br />pursuit of health. We send love/light to all seed manufacturers<br />who are not using genetically modified products. We suggest<br />what's already been suggested from the caller Lori to buy seeds.<br />Some seeds can be used for sprouts. This can also be healthy (if<br />the sprouts are grown in very good sanitary conditions).<br />&nbsp;<br />We see some people concerned about the comet Elenin. We do not<br />see it producing such drastic effects as some people are<br />predicting. There may be some disruption of electronics; however,<br />some of this can come from the sun at this time. <br />&nbsp;<br />We send love/light for freedom of communication and freedom of<br />the Internet, freedom that all people everywhere can freely<br />communicate for the highest good.&nbsp; We take a look at the media<br />who are doomsayers and predictors of doom and we ask that there<br />be more stories of human love and human compassion and more<br />animal stories wherein there can be the stories of heroism of<br />pets and the good bond between many pets and their owners. <br />&nbsp;<br />We send love/light to Jim Cole for the ironing out of his<br />problems so that he can proceed forward with his products.<br />&nbsp;<br />We take a look at Texas and we have been looking at Texas off and<br />on since Jim has mentioned the high pressure area.&nbsp; It is also<br />over parts of New Mexico and we look at the rain moving in. We<br />envision rain moving into the area, but not in such large amounts<br />as to be a determent. We speak slowly here as we are not merely<br />saying words but are over Texas.&nbsp; We are in the stream of flow<br />from the Gulf of Mexico and other converging streams. We see<br />there are two ways to work with this.&nbsp; One way is to dissipate<br />the high pressure area and not simply move it over another area. <br />&nbsp;<br />We send love/light for good suggestions and decisions to the<br />Supreme Court and we see that sovereignty for the states is a<br />good thing so it is closer to home and people can make decisions<br />better for their own area than can be made for them from a<br />distance. We send love/light to the senators and also the<br />representatives and Obama that they can make good decisions and<br />can apply the principles of their heartfelt, well-reasoned ideas<br />to their job and the wishes of the constituents within their<br />jurisdictions rather than to follow lobbyists. <br />&nbsp;<br />We take a moment and we look at programs to induce mind control<br />and the effort to automate mind control by use of machines, which<br />in our mind is ridiculous and does not work and confuses<br />situations and boomerangs against the people who are trying to<br />make that work.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is false reasoning that they attempt to put<br />into place.&nbsp; However the human spirit is beyond that and beyond<br />such control.&nbsp; It simply adds a confusion factor into one’s<br />space and makes it hard to deal with one’s life and hard to<br />come across one’s own reasoning. It makes it harder.&nbsp; One needs<br />a free mind to observe and to make decisions based upon the<br />current situation. We send such ideas to people that are<br />instigating such programs that they come to their senses. <br />&nbsp;<br />We turn the program back over to Wynn Free and we thank each of<br />you on the call as you are soldiers in the land where there<br />should be plenty and there are barriers to the dispencement, and<br />to bring a land of peace and plenty to all. We profoundly thank<br />each and every one of you and we appreciate you more than you can<br />know. We leave but we do not leave. Adonai.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> One of the things I am learning on these calls is that we<br />are the creators of our lives.&nbsp; The Elohim and the Ra group are<br />co-creators with us.&nbsp; They can add to us, we can add to them. <br />But as we expand our possibilities, we become miracle creators.<br />Because in their realm, what we call miracles is just common<br />place.&nbsp; It's those of you who experience synchronicities that<br />know that, and that it is through our intention that miracles are<br />created. <br /><br />Those of you who listened to last Wednesdays call, there was a<br />very interesting little session where I asked what causes us to<br />be able to increase our intention to the level where it<br />penetrates and changes things and the answer was "need".&nbsp; Need is<br />what causes our intentions to be amplified.&nbsp; I mentioned how we<br />have read how some mother’s son was trapped under a car tire<br />and she picked up the car and moved it over to free her son so it<br />was need that created that intention.&nbsp; If we look at the<br />circumstances of the world, as things get tough, it gives us the<br />opportunity to use our need to create miracles, to create<br />connection, to increase our intention to where we become more<br />than we would believe we could be. <br /><br />So, when we see things that look like difficulties, and we can<br />meet them head on, they can be provocateurs for our own self.&nbsp; In<br />The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce, one of the things the Ra group<br />said was that the breaking down of things was going to create the<br />opportunity for people to help each other and to reach for each<br />other and in the way they helped each other,. and in the way they<br />responded to it, was going to create the opportunity for more<br />people to graduate this realm.&nbsp; Keep in mind this is one lifetime<br />over many, many, many lifetimes and that this happens to be a<br />unique lifetime.&nbsp; In this lifetime, according to our Sources,<br />there is going to be a separation of souls; those that graduate<br />and those that repeat this realm and in order to graduate, your<br />heart has to be open.<br /><br />So, the circumstances of a sound economy, and the circumstances<br />of people needing each other creates the opportunity for your<br />heart being opened.&nbsp; A book I read was talking about "the dark<br />night of the soul", and it said that most people won't go through<br />their dark night of the soul unless they are up against a wall.&nbsp; <br />They will always go for a distraction.&nbsp; They will always go for<br />something that will keep them from going through a dark night<br />because going through that dark night means the surfacing of your<br />pain. So the world circumstance is pushing us against the wall so<br />we have to go through our dark night.&nbsp; We can look at that as a<br />blessing because you might say...would I rather have the little<br />tough time economically and learn to reach for my neighbor and<br />graduate this realm, or would I rather be comfortable here, but<br />not necessarily having an open heart....&nbsp; Being comfortable means<br />being comfortable, it means having your expenses paid, it means<br />feeling superior if you have a lot of money and oftentimes it<br />means putting up walls and barriers.&nbsp; You don't need other<br />people.&nbsp; You can take care of yourself.&nbsp; So, needing other<br />people, needing each other pushes us into the position of raising<br />our intent so that we can learn to access that miracle making<br />part of ourselves.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />Copyright 2002-2011 Wynn Free and Message a Day &nbsp;This<br />transcription may be freely shared, provided this copyright<br />notice and contact information is included and there is no<br />charge.
