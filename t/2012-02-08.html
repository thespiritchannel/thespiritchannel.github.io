<p class="western"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span><b>Wynn</b></span></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>: This is Wednesday, February 8</span></span><sup><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>th</span></span></sup><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span> [2012] – Wynn Free in Sedona, Terry Brown. This is our Wednesday night question and answer call; tonight we’re going to call in the light and we’re going to keep it short because we’re packing to go to Los Angeles. We’re going to be at the Conscious Life Expo; on Sunday we’re doing a live grid healing. I normally greet each of you if you’re listening on the replays.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>The format tonight is slightly different because I’m going to call in the light first; then each of you can put things in the light just like on our Sunday call. Anyone who is listening, after you track my words and use your imagination, you don’t have to believe that it’s real until you have an experience, just use your imagination just in case you get that to click in.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>This is not logical; this is not rational and it’s not understandable even. I don’t understand it. Nonetheless, there is something that happens here that it is up to each person to have their own experience. We say it’s a bit of a mystery, but we’ll leave it at that.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="DejaVuSans" style="font-family: DejaVuSans;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Father Mother God, the One Infinite Creator, we ask for the presence of the light to surround and protect each person here. Any negativity be taken to the highest realms of light and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the galaxies, through the Solar Logos, through all the Milky Way, through the energy fields of the planets in our solar system, through the sun and the moon, the outer energy fields of the earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth. Right now, we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One to join with us. We create a protected space that only the positive has access to and anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>Right now I want you to imagine that you are surrounded by these beings, this consciousness, you can think of them as angels. The Ra group says they have team surrounding us; just imagine that a team is around us and it’s intelligent. It’s surrounding your body in a loving cocoon of energy, of comfort. You feel part of something.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>These beings, this consciousness is always around you. Right now, we can feel the love they are projecting around and through you. Your job is to receive, to let it in and to direct it where you need it in your body. If it can be healed, then let it be done. You are worthy of being loved; you are worthy of receiving.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>We extend this, of course, to everyone who is listening to the replays; you’re here also. I’m going to open the mics and let you verbally say things to put in this field of energy. You can do it silently; you’re already doing it. If you want to say it verbally, I want you to say it in such a way, that you do your best to hold the reverence, the reverent energy. I’ll keep the tape recorder on, and if you’d rather not put it in the recording, then after everyone says it that doesn’t mind be recorded, we’ll stop the recording then you can do it not exactly privately but to the small group that’s on the line.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>I’d like to start: I’d like to put my trip to Los Angeles, safe driving, warm reception, finding new people who are interested in our work that we can help. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>Remember: keep the reverence; keeping it reverent means even though people are listening, don’t worry about who is listening. Worry about the spirit that’s listening; make pretend that God is listening; that you’re really being heard.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span>Now I scared everybody off.</span></span></p>
