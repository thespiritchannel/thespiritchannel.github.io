<p></p>
<p>This is Sunday July 24 (2011) and I wish everybody a happy<br />Sunday or whatever day it is when you are listening to this&nbsp;call.</p>
<p>I am going to start using the Sunday notice as a newsletter.&nbsp;<br />(Wynn sends out a notice before the call each Sunday.) There's<br />all these things that are happening that I think people might<br />be interested in. &nbsp;For example, David Wilcock and myself are<br />in a movie called Metaphysia that has been released and it won<br />first price at the Akasha Film Festival. &nbsp;I have given a link<br />to the trailer of the movie today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We now have an archive section. &nbsp;The links to everything we<br />have sent out on the spirit channel are posted on it and you<br />can access it at...<a href="http://www.thespiritchannel.net">www.thespiritchannel.net</a>..., all one word.&nbsp;<br />The topics are there and you can browse through them and find<br />things we have done in the past that would be helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, on August 6th and 7th, 2011, Terry and I are going to<br />be in Phoenix at the Vision Quest bookstore in the afternoons.<br />On Saturday I am doing a lecture and on Sunday we are doing a<br />four-and-a-half hour workshop and Terry will also be there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have been on our calls or been part of our on-line<br />workshops, it may not be new information, but there will be a<br />lot of new people there. &nbsp;When you come to an event like that,<br />you learn how to hold the energy and you actually help hold<br />the energy for the new people. Many of you are really tuning<br />in to what we are doing here and we are creating a group<br />consciousness. &nbsp;The idea of a group consciousness is new for<br />many people. &nbsp;How do you create a group consciousness without<br />losing yourself? &nbsp;Some people believe they have to lose<br />themselves but the truth is that everything is in the moment,<br />so if you can be in the moment you can move into this group<br />consciousness, and when its over you go back to yourself or<br />another group consciousness. &nbsp;In the highest truth there is<br />only one consciousness but since we are in 3D, everything is<br />shifting and changing all the time, so we can only do one<br />thing at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We are in this group consciousness on this call, and then when<br />we hang up we move into whatever we move into next. &nbsp;Some of<br />you have a group consciousness with your family, or your<br />friends , or you may be by yourself and can learn to have a<br />group consciousness with yourself and spirit energies and<br />that's very powerful. &nbsp;One of the most important things we do<br />on this call is we create a group consciousness together while<br />I just facilitate. &nbsp;<br /><br />The group consciousness we create here is<br />unusual because it doesn't just encompass the people on the<br />line, we have sources from other dimensions that are positive<br />and very big. &nbsp;They join us in our group consciousness and we<br />can then create group intentions and its VERY powerful. &nbsp;Each<br />of us has the ability to create intentions and impact other<br />realms. &nbsp;But when we do it as a group, that's when we get into<br />the aspect of miraculous transformations. &nbsp;Those of us on the<br />calls regularly have seen those things happen many, many<br />times. &nbsp;<br /><br />Often times when you have a miraculous transformation,<br />you may ask is that coincidence or is it because we did that.&nbsp;<br />That's one of the things that Ra calls the Law of Confusion.&nbsp;<br />It's not meant to be clear that something happened because of<br />Them as that would create subservience, blind following,<br />capitulation and that is not the idea. &nbsp;The idea is to create<br />individual empowerment and when we access the group<br />consciousness, we are only accessing ourselves; larger parts<br />of ourselves that most of us have lost track of and it's like<br />reintegrating things we didn't know were there. &nbsp;Then when we<br />do, many people email me telling me it feels like home. &nbsp; It<br />feels like what it should feel like which is probably&nbsp;accurate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we access this group energy, we have people, you, who<br />make suggestions about things that we want to intend to shift.<br />This is a very rare thing we are doing. &nbsp;What's most rare<br />about it is not only are we accessing group consciousnesses<br />that are huge and are there to help us (we are not the only<br />people who do this.) &nbsp;You don't need to be a channeller, or<br />need to understand metaphysics. &nbsp;If you pray in the right way,<br />you will connect with this. &nbsp;In our case, they are talking<br />back to us through Terry and relay back their message from the<br />point of view of the large group consciousness communicating<br />to us. &nbsp;That's very rare to have both of these together at the<br />same time.</p>
<p>Okay, let's start putting things in the light:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Lori: &nbsp;San Carlos</strong> , I'd like to put the forces of nature in<br />the love/light to be more balanced and harmonized worldwide<br />and also put the wildlife in to be protected and sustained and<br />healed- thank you Wynn, Terry and all.</p>
<p><strong>Cinda:</strong> I’d like to put the whales and dolphins in the light<br />especially those on the East and West Coast of America.</p>
<p><strong>Ann: Tahoe:</strong> I'd like to put the air, water, Earth, fire in the<br />light. &nbsp; Evidently a volcano went off by Barstow, California<br />on the 23rd (of July) near the Marine Corps area on highway<br />40. &nbsp;I remember Ra'an saying that sometimes the magma will<br />permeate &nbsp;lovelight through the fissures and rifts, so that is<br />my intention.</p>
<p><strong>Gina: &nbsp;O’ahu; Hawai’i</strong>- I'd like to put Gaia in the light and<br />all animals and humans with emphasis on the Whales/Dolphins.&nbsp;<br />Also, a lot of people are uneasy now with Congress, the<br />government and the financial situation and I'd like people's<br />minds to be eased that everything will be okay and to send<br />light to that idea. &nbsp;In other words to help us get through the<br />tunnel to the sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>Zoe: &nbsp;Sacramento:</strong> &nbsp;I'd like to send love/light to all the<br />people deliberating in Washington, looking for a way, that<br />both parties will accept, out of the financial situation.</p>
<p><strong>Tina: &nbsp;Sedona:</strong> I'd like to ask for &nbsp;blessings for the animals<br />and wildlife in the world and especially to stop the slaughter<br />of the Northern Rocky wolves and wild Mustangs. &nbsp;They are<br />under fire and this particular administration is not friendly<br />towards them and there have been laws passed that are very<br />detrimental and if it starts with the wolves, it'll go to all<br />our wildlife. &nbsp;So I'd like to ask a special prayer for them.&nbsp;<br />Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Oren: Salt Lake City:</strong> &nbsp;I'd like to ask for assistance for all<br />beings on the planet to heal past life karma, past life tracks<br />that are limiting us and creating fear, and closure in the&nbsp;present.</p>
<p><strong>Gijs:</strong> I want to ask for the loving energies to be sent to the<br />secret Government. that they will straighten out stuff and act<br />for the people instead of for themselves. &nbsp;Also ask for the<br />love/light to be sent to those situations and relations which<br />are in harmony currently, so instead of going against the bad,<br />being pro the good. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Michael: &nbsp;San Diego</strong>: I'd like to put the energy of<br />transformation of consciousness in the light. &nbsp;If we can all<br />take a step forward, we can eliminate a lot of this if we can<br />get everyone to just step forward, up. Also freedom of speech<br />and communication of the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Great. &nbsp; I'm giving away my book <i>Creator Gods of the<br /></i><i>Physical Universe Want to Talk to You</i> &nbsp;and it's a really good<br />way to introduce this to people. &nbsp;They can go to website:<br /><a href="http://www.creatorgodbook.com">www.creatorgodbook.com</a> and the person downloads it and is<br />introduced to what we are doing and can be put on the mailing<br />list. &nbsp;We don't have to try to explain it to them but let<br />nature take its course. &nbsp;The people that resonate with it will<br />end up being on this line.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna: Eureka</strong> : I'd like to ask for the love/light to all<br />those wanting to increase their vibration and evolve on the<br />planet, who are struggling because they are having a hard time<br />incorporating the new frequencies, eclipses and artificial<br />barriers or obstacles like HAARP or chem trails or anything<br />getting in their way of being able to integrate the new<br />frequencies and move forward. &nbsp;I also like to ask the<br />love/light to help open peoples' minds and hearts so that<br />clean non-toxic food, water, air and shelter is available for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p><strong>Brian: &nbsp;Sedona:</strong> I'd like to ask for a creation of a group mind<br />collective consciousness around the planet for all those<br />involved in environmental work and all those in power who want<br />to support environmental work to form an alliance and work<br />together for solutions for the planet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Carolyn: &nbsp;Davis:</strong> &nbsp;I'd like to ask for light/light to all those<br />who are refugees. &nbsp;They are all over the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Zoe:</strong> &nbsp;I'd like to ask for love/light for the sun as it's<br />making its transition, that it can be smooth and easy for it<br />and since we're in its path behind it, that we would gain in<br />that smoothness also.</p>
<p><strong>Tamara: New Mexico:</strong> I'd like to put the fires in the<br />love/light. &nbsp;Also to give thanks that we have been getting<br />rain which is a blessing. &nbsp;We have been getting very light<br />showers off and on since the last Sunday grid and hopefully<br />we'll continue to get it. &nbsp;Also the firefighters and people<br />who work in safety and medicine also I want to put in the<br />love/light. &nbsp;I don't want to forget them either.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> &nbsp;This is another situation that looks like a<br />coincidence; it could be, as we've been putting rain for New<br />Mexico in the light starting a couple of weeks ago and then I<br />got an email I think from Belinda, saying the day after the<br />grid healing, it rained for 3 days and it hadn't rained since<br />November. &nbsp;So if we had any intervention on that, we thank our<br />Sources for helping.</p>
<p><strong>Brian: Sedona:</strong> If we could ask for the healing of the<br />environment over Arizona and for rain &nbsp;here in Arizona that it<br />can quelch the fires here and bring the monsoon season back to<br />what it used to be in the Arizona zone.</p>
<p><strong>Michael: San Diego</strong> : For all the people who are looking for<br />their own personal, physical &nbsp;healing to be put in the light<br />and there be the energies for them to be ready, able and<br />deserving of those healings.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna:</strong> I live at an organic orchard and we hardly have any<br />fruit this year and every year we have less fruit, so I'd like<br />to put the organic orchards and farms in the light and to<br />correct whatever the cause is, whether it be the bees, or the&nbsp;weather.</p>
<p><strong>Zoe:</strong> I'd like to send love/light to the new economy that it<br />appear on the planet as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> On this next part of the call, we are going to do a<br />visualization which helps us connect with the energies. &nbsp;(Wynn<br />does the meditation)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Wynn:</strong> (calls in the light)</p>
<p><strong>Terry (R A’AN):</strong> We greet you in the love/light of the One<br />Infinite Creator. &nbsp;This is RA’AN ,July 24, 2011. &nbsp;We look at<br />the coordinates within and out planet Earth and we see a fresh<br />new energy moving through the outskirts and atmosphere of the<br />planet which then is intersecting and bouncing off and<br />harmonizing with the surface of the planet as the planet has<br />layers. &nbsp;In the layers above there are weather patterns and we<br />see the concepts, we see the items, the changes that the<br />individuals are asking for and they are affecting all that is.</p>
<p>We look at rain in areas of drought wherein it is not only<br />Texas and New Mexico, it is areas of Australia, it is areas of<br />Africa which needs rain and we send healing and tranquility<br />and love/light, &nbsp;to the peoples of Africa as well as the<br />peoples in any area of drought, and to Arizona to Brian's<br />request for monsoons to return and we envision rain for not<br />only areas of southern Arizona but for areas of Northern&nbsp;Arizona.</p>
<p>We send love/light to the Congress and we look at the Congress<br />and the difficulties they are having with agreement. &nbsp;We ask<br />Grace- the unit of the Elohim to send her WD-40 healing and<br />the release of interlocking geometries that there can be an<br />end to the deadlocks and they may come up with a plan for the<br />economy. &nbsp;New economy is not established in a flash. &nbsp;It is a<br />process that may take gradiently a while to establish and we<br />integrate those ideas in love/light to the Congress and the<br />Senate and the leaders. &nbsp;As the U.S. goes it also has a large<br />affect upon the world economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then move to send &nbsp;love/light to all the families that are<br />working very very hard to make ends meet and to make sense of<br />the problems that have beset them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We send love/light to the whales, to the dolphins not only in<br />the East and West Coast but all over the world- as they are a<br />stabilization factor in &nbsp;the creation of a more cosmic<br />consciousness holding this ideal for all of consciousness of<br />the planet. &nbsp; They are a multidimensional creature and both<br />whales and dolphins are multidimensional and can access<br />different dimensions and can help stabilize not only the grids<br />of the Earth but the consciousness of people on the Earth.</p>
<p>We send love/light to the water and we give it a minute to<br />permeate water everywhere and we see that individuals, their<br />bodies, are to a very great degree made of water and we then<br />send a message that individuals everywhere will be able to<br />harmonize and integrate their life better when they have<br />enough water within their system. &nbsp;It lubricates all functions<br />of the body and prevents wrinkles and allows the individual to<br />move &nbsp;in and out of their daily duties better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We send love/light to the internet and to freedom of speech<br />everywhere. &nbsp;For this is another thing that lubricates the<br />actions and responses within a person's life. &nbsp;It helps them<br />to release trauma and helps them to move with the energies.</p>
<p>We send love/light to the sun, and the planets, and the whole<br />solar system with its integration with the Hunab Ku and we see<br />that in-streaming energies are activating not only the sun and<br />its reaction and change of solar cycle but also activating the<br />volcanic systems and melting the snows and the glaciers in the<br />Arctic which makes their &nbsp;summertime &nbsp;longer and the weather<br />warmer. We send support to all the factors such as these. It's<br />not only Earth that has melting at the poles, but &nbsp;there are<br />other planets also.</p>
<p>We then, in the light of this, take a look at the organic<br />farms and the lack of fruit that have come about this year due<br />to extreme cold frosts in the spring. We also look at earth<br />currents and see that some have changed due to the changes<br />within the Gulf . &nbsp;The oil spill &nbsp;has lowered the temperature<br />of the gulf which has created some change in earth's patterns.<br />We allow for a moment here for readjustments as readjustments<br />start in the etheric with the placement of the concept that<br />eventually can manifest.</p>
<p>We send love/light to each and every person on this line as<br />you are anchors and helping immensely towards restabilization<br />and holding stabilization within the group-think and within the<br />manifestations within the Earth plane.</p>
<p>We send love/light to the firefighters everywhere as they are<br />doing a magnificent job in general.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We send love/light to the refugees everywhere that they may<br />find themselves and find their home and begin a new life. <br /><br />We&nbsp;send love/light to the animals everywhere and people seeking a<br />new life and a new home that they find support and to be&nbsp;reestablished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We send love/light also to individuals who are caught up in<br />cycles of karma and that are therefore unable to find closure<br />and they are not able to heal what it was that happened. They<br />carry an injustice in their heart even though they don't<br />remember or they have a conception of how life is, based upon<br />something that was laid upon them in the past of this life or<br />a past life and we ask that these individuals everywhere can<br />find support and can look at their own patterns and observe<br />them and know that all makes sense based upon how they have<br />oriented themselves and that these patterns can be observed<br />and clarified and come to front to be known to themselves and<br />as such then they can compare them to the realities that they<br />can then create for themselves when they do obtain closure<br />within their past.</p>
<p>Again we thank, we appreciate our brothers and sisters, the<br />light workers and each and every one of you. &nbsp;It is with<br />profound appreciation that we make this contact and we are<br />available to you without or with the phone line- and we are<br />there for you. We send love/light to each and every one of you<br />for a magical day today and continued &nbsp;upward string of<br />growth. &nbsp;We leave but we do not leave. &nbsp;Adonai.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you very much, and &nbsp;thank you both to our sources<br />and thank you to everyone on the line who are contributing<br />your own energies and being extremely important in anchoring<br />these energies in this realm.</p>
<p>The next and closing part of this call is where we do a<br />visualization on a planetary level similar to the<br />visualization we did earlier on a personal level. <br /><br />(Wynn&nbsp;conducts the visualization).</p>
