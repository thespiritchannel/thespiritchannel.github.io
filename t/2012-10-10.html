Why can’t you speak openly to people, and why must they communicate through the voice of a person?<br />&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

This is Wednesday, 10-10-2012; Wynn Free in Westminster, California, of all places. Thank you all for bearing with us on Monday; believe it or not you can probably hear I have kind of a cold. We over-did it over the weekend; we were at the Conscious Life Expo. It was a three-day show, and by the time it was over on Monday, I was falling over – literally – there was so much energy output I had to concentrate not to fall.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">How are you, Terry? </span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Terry</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: I kind of over-did it too, trying to keep up with everything and get everything done – and driving half the night to get there to the Expo. So, I’m recovering, too. Also on Monday, we were just really, really dead tired. So we did a replay and I understand that some people couldn’t hear it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Next time, if we do a replay, we’ll prepare it in advance and edit it and make sure that it comes out okay on BBS Radio. Just letting you know that we are very human and we get really tired. I don’t know if you heard the Sunday grid healing, but it was really unusual because it started out at 10:00. For some mistaken reason – it was a mistake – they booked my lecture at 11:00. We actually just went from the grid healing at 10:00 into the lecture; it’s something I never did before. It was interesting, because I was holding the energy for both things. It was like it was a very intense lecture.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Nonetheless, we’re still recuperating. Believe it or not that when we do these things I think what happens is everything we do – everything everyone does – we’re always combining our energies if we’re open to what we do; what we involve ourselves with, who we’re with. Sometimes it can be overwhelming, depending on who your energies are combining with; so particularly with a bunch of people that are hearing me for the first time, which is what happened at the Expo. It takes a tremendous output of energy to reach them, or to try to reach them. Then, we did a workshop – which you guys weren’t privy to – Sunday night for three hours. That’s why Monday we were so out of it. I’m still kind of out it; I’m still recuperating. You can probably hear it in my voice.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Tonight’s the night that we ask questions that you have submitted. We never know what’s going to happen and what’s going to be brought forth. Just for the constant disclaimer that channeled material is not meant to be believed blindly. It’s always possible, when someone is channeling, to bleed through part of their conscious mind. I know that happens with both Terry and Daphne at different times. It’s also possible to have a negative source take over and start talking; that one, I don’t think, happens that much but still - it’s possible. If I’m ever sure that it occurred, I certainly will give everyone a heads-up because a negative source doesn’t sound negative. It sounds like it knows what it’s talking about and it uses all the same vocabulary.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Obviously – in this period of time right now – we are approaching this December 21</span><sup><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">st</span></sup><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">, 2012 date which many people have a lot of anticipation about. One thing I’m going to – we had questions about this – I’m probably not going to ask these questions directly. We have asked many, many questions about this particular topic in the past. It has to do with “Are E.T.s going to save us?” There is a lot of E.T. activity on our planet right now. Many groups are saying that these E.T.s are going to intervene and stop some of the negative agendas.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">According to our answers to the questions concerning this, that’s not the way it’s going to work. Many of the E.T.s that we see – many of the spaceships – are actually service-to-self groups. In one of the agendas, there are service-to-self groups that would like to take us over and that are actually channeling through what call the elite and giving them instructions. When you try to figure this out by googling stuff – which I have – there’s so much [how would I say it?] layers upon layers of disinformation that it is really hard to find up from down.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">One of the things that I’ve learned about the Elohim/Ra group is that they’re concern is for us to evolve spiritually and to create energetic connections that allow us to evolve our DNA. Giving up your power to an outside source does not evolve you spiritually. In general, anything which makes you disempowered and waiting for an outside source to do something is probably not positive. That has to do with E.T.s landing, it has to do with waiting for a Messiah, it has to do with waiting for something to abolish all the debt. In my observations, I haven’t seen anything like that be actually any reason to believe it’s positive.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">When we asked the question, “Are there any E.T. groups that are helping us, and how are they’re doing that?’ the answer was that the higher dimensions there are certain groups that are working on creating portals and wormholes – that’s all they said. The E.T.s that we see – even the messages that people get from the E.T.s – I would be very leery of. I could be wrong; I’m just telling you what my information is. I did run this by Carla Rueckert and she has the same information. You can draw your own conclusions about this.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">We have some really good questions tonight. Let me see here – are you ready, Terry? No.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Terry</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: As ready as ever.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: She says “AS ready as ever.” You’ll have to excuse our low energy for this evening, but it is what it is. We’re showing up, regardless. Let me call in the light:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Father Mother God we ask for the presence of the light to surround and protect Terry, myself and every one on the line. And, any negativity be taken to the highest realms of light and released and transmuted for the highest good of all concerned. We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the solar system, through the outer energy fields of planet earth, through our bodies and into the center of the earth. Right now, we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One to join with us and we create a protected space that only the positive has access to. Anything not of that nature must leave now.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">We will turn it over to our sources to say hello to us through Terry.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: We greet you in the love light of the one infinite Creator. This is October 10</span><sup><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">th</span></sup><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">, 2012 on planet earth; location: California is where we are centered. However, we are also non-linearly connected and in contact with each and every person that wishes to have contact made with them wherever they may be and whenever they may listen to this channeling or they may read a transcript. It is our honor to have such contact, and it is a sacred moment that we are able to make contact.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">This is a question from Ron in Mexico. It’s a two-part question, and it is about power or energy contained in a well-formulated question.</span></span></span></p>
<p>“<span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Much has been written and demonstrated about the energy contained in the asking of a question. A question is what seems to initiate our communication with source, and that may be because asking a question of source demonstrates we are taking the first important step towards source; we are acknowledging its presence.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Can you explain the questioning process in terms of how it works, why it works, when it works and importantly – if you were to ask us as a group one important question – what would you ask us?”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: We are smiling. We like this question.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">When we are able to connect with you, it is a very important moment in time. We want the connection to be pertinent to you. We want the energy to flow, so we want it to be on a subject that you care about; that you are interested in, and you wish to know more about, because it is this interest that carries your vibration through the veil to us.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">So, we determine what the topic will be by asking you to ask us. That will put us on the same page, and will allow us to provide an avenue for whatever growth we can for you, and an avenue for you to expand in some area which you wish to expand into, to know more about; some area you wish to open up to release a stuckness and to grow.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">What question do we have for you, and is that question for you personally or is it a question for the group? We are here; we are visiting in your density, as we are from the tenth density, and we, then, are vibrating in your sphere. We are vibrating with you, if you wish that. If you do not wish that, then we do not interfere with your choices.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Could you repeat any part of the question that is still open?</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn:</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"> Ron asked “If you were going to ask us as a group one important question, what would that be?” Of course, the group is not going to answer this. I think he’s saying, “From your point of view who is looking at us – if you had a question for us, what would it be?”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: If we had a question for you, our question would be nothing that we are trying to elicit information from you - as we are able to obtain information – but, something that would allow you to think further about your future: What do you envision your future growth to be when and if you were to realize that you continue; you continue after the transition, after you end your, after your body passes on and you – as a being – continue. What do you, how would this change your life if you envisioned your life as continuing after that?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">We would ask that question with the hopes it would trigger more thought in the area, more investigation, as to how you direct your life so that you can make a smooth transition. It could make differences in the way you live your life; in the way you connect with those you love. In the way that you collect things that you may not be able to take with you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">That is our answer.</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Thank you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">From Steve in Flagstaff:</span></span></span></p>
<p>“<span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">It seems that the vibratory rate of the planet has been changing as we move towards the fourth density. The change has been gradual but steady as I perceive it. Will we continue gradual change until the shift completes, or will there be a sudden, major shift?”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: In a gradual change that is gradually increasing in tempo, increasing in vibration and thinning the veil between your realm and the other realm – the veil is getting thinner the higher vibration that you experience in the third density as you are moving up the scale into more awareness, more psychic ability, more ability to connect, more perception.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Will this continue? And will it be a sudden jump? We see that there may be some skips and jumps, and that it will reach a point and then will begin gradually, gradually to level off and to – we see a division, wherein some individuals will hold to the higher frequencies; other individuals will not be able to hold to the higher frequency and will then move into an area of the universe that is comfortable for them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">That is our answer.</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Thank you.</span></span></span></p>

What is the potential for those kinds of events to occur as of this moment?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: There are number of avenues that have been explored to make events happen, that would then de-stabilize things in the different areas of biology, viruses, food supply, nuclear radiation release. There are things such as potential for de-stabilization of the electric grid.</span></span></span></p>

We are working toward that. There are individuals that would work in the area to de-stabilize things through war and through sickness, however we work to stabilize earth so that earth can move past, the people can move past, those things. Those things are there; those things are out there that individuals have been putting together. We work to stabilize things so that these things do not take over or gain superiority.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">This is from Erica:</span></p>
<p>“<span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Why are animals being unprotected by the higher sources? Why do we have such horrible murders of dolphins, whales and other animals? Why is there not something done to protect them?” That’s the question; thank you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Thank you. Give us a moment.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">This question is even more broad-ranging than the person asked.</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">It is that many people are experiencing difficulties; many children go missing. There are many animals that are not treated correctly, and we, as the Elohim, are not the ones to step in and govern how these things are managed. These things are left to the individuals in the third density; they are left to the animal-souls; they are left to the dolphin-souls to work out their connections with each other, and to grow.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">We see that many people do not like this answer. However, we are a source of love for everyone; for the animals, for the people, for the different races. When they grow to ask for protection; when they grow to wish protection even – then we can come in and protect them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Thank you. We have a question here from Brigit whose father – after a long illness – chose to end his life a couple of days ago; this has her wondering whether souls who choose to end their own lives are put through the same after-life process - or a different after-life process - as those who do not take their own life after they have transitioned over.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Thank you.

Each individual has their own intention, their own desires and are working through their own path. Therefore, each one is handled according to their own disposition, their own desires, their own regrets; as we do see regret. Many people who take their life do not think of all the consequences and all that they are going to be losing, even if they are moving out of a difficult circumstance. It is all geared – all the things that happen – are geared to that individual’s outlook, to their desires, to their movement on the path; what they wish to obtain.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">We see, in this case, regret; that it was not known that the individual would continue and would have perception and would miss things. We recommend that you talk to your father; you tell him what you have wanted to tell him during your life. Even write it down; in some way, to some degree, he will get it.</span></span></span></p>

It is coming out as rage; he has great passion and he has not known how to move forward. He is trying to make huge break-throughs against something that has stopped him; against a barrier during his childhood - a barrier at being able to do something that he wishes to. This rage has great power. He has chosen different targets that are not the same as when he was a child, but in dealing with it – although it is difficult to deal with – perhaps you can get him talking about his childhood and see if you can make a game of it, to see if you can determine where he was thwarted when he was a child; what he wanted to do and wasn’t able to do – where he was stopped and he couldn’t move forward as he wanted to do, as he is still trying to break through those barriers.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Thank you. The opening line that Terry said might have been muted. She said “We see that your husband does have passion.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Next question is from Greg. Greg, when he walks under street lights – he’s in Post Falls, Idaho – they go out; it happens a lot. Once I walked under eight lights in a row and they all went out, one right after the other, when I walked under them. It’s too often to be coincidental, and it’s happened for years. It makes me feel kind of weird. When I heard this happens to Daphne and Terry it made me feel a whole lot better, but it’s still mysterious to me.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">My question is: What could be going on here, and does this mean anything or signify anything about me – or, is it just nothing?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Thank you. Greg.</span></span></span></p>

[This] implies that you have a very large field; a very large field electrical potential, and that you re-route the electricity when you walk under it. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">One thing that happened once to Terry was that she was sitting in a restaurant in British Columbia, Canada – and, she was playing in the electrical wires up near the ceiling of one of the rooms in the restaurant. As she did it, it drew the whole current off of its center and knocked out the electricity for all of British Columbia. It is a moving-off the centering of the electrical current, which then causes the devices to go off.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Next question is from Andrew; Andrew – I don’t have his location.</span></span></span></p>
<p>“<span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Why do I feel an imperative response to become a martyr? I mean this on psychical, emotional and physical realms. Moreover, how can I live the rest of my life in the fashion with growth rather than detriment?”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Thank you.

Notice the feeling that you have; check the emotions with that. Is there some grief, some loss? [Is there] a loss of connection, a feeling of sadness, a feeling of wanting to cry? You are a beautiful being, and this is a long-time pattern; it is a feeling of not wanting to intrude, not wanting to be in the way.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Take a look at these feelings when you have them and then see if you can erase that feeling. You can release that feeling; and then, think of the feeling of joy, of connection and how beautiful your extension out to others really is and the joy of connecting. What – when you are in a martyrdom state – what other people will lose? </span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">In a way, it is thinking of yourself and leaving others out, and projecting to your image of what they are doing as being better than, or against you, and you having value in your martyrdom. Take it apart; what are your exact feelings there? Even write it down and then notice the grief that you feel at the martyrdom, because at the bottom of things, you are a part of everything and you are wanted to be a part of everything and, to let the martyrdom go.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Thank you. We have a question from W.N. Stevenson, and I think I’m going to answer this question because this has been covered.</span></span></span></p>
<p>“<span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Why don’t the Elohim materialize in bodies and make themselves visible to some of us who would like to see them in solid, 3-D form?”</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">You know, there was an incident in 10,500 B.C. where the Ra group did materialize in bodies that were visible to people. They register it as one of their greatest errors, because it caused people to become blind followers. When you take into consideration there are high negative sources that can do various things in this realm, like they can speak through people, they can do prophecies, they can be very psychic. How could you tell if a body was walking around saying “Hi, I’m the Elohim” if it was the Elohim? How could you prove it?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">They want to say something.</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: We are amused, in that if we took on a body, bodies are very limiting. They cannot see in 360&deg; areas; they cannot get bigger and smaller suddenly. It is an imposition in space and time; it is a frigidity. We then – even in the area of thinking – can think in more dimensions than simply in the third density, as the third density leaves out a lot of the frequencies that are available.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">We do not see that this limited frigidity would be very much fun.</span></p>

<p>“<span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Why can’t you speak openly to people, and why must they communicate through the voice of a person?”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Again, I’ll just make my own little side-comment here:</span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Both the negative and the positive can channel. Certain people have the talents to expand their fields to be receptive to this, but most people don’t. It’s kind of a gift, just like playing guitar or being a painter for somebody that has that talent. Also, they would be imposing on somebody’s free will just to start talking to someone, and how would that person know if that voice was the Elohim or some negative source? It’s very tricky.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Ra’An</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: Thank you. We are a very high frequency and we have tried, when people pray, we have tried to communicate. However, we do not have a physical voice, and we have a very high frequency. So, most of it goes right over people’s heads. Maybe they get some sense that something has been answered or said, but they do not figure – very often – that it is real because it is so high a frequency and so light; it is ‘airy’ and it is not as tangible as a real human voice.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>Wynn</b></span><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">: I will mention that both Terry and Daphne, when they both started bringing these messages forth, both had the experience as if they were making it up; its got a surreal quality that it seems like it could be your imagination. It’s only when you look in depth at what was said that one realizes that neither of them could have possibly come up with most of the kinds of information and the wisdom and the knowledge of things out of their conscious mind. Although, it seems like imagination; it seems like day-dreaming. It’s like mastering the art of doing that.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">It’s not like in a human body we can decide “I’m going to talk to this person” or “I’m going to get a megaphone and talk to lots of people at once.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">We’re coming to an end; it’s 6:57. I thank you all; those were great questions tonight. There were a couple questions that we didn’t get to. Again, I tell people if you ask something and we didn’t ask your question tonight, please submit it again next week.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><span face="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">There were some good questions that we didn’t get to - I’m trying to see the lady’s name here – about the relationship of the Elohim and the Ra to Jesus. We’ve asked that before; we can ask it again next week. It’s a good question. On that note, we can have them say goodbye to us and then we’ll close this session.</span></span></span></p>
