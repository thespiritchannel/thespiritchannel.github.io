<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Wynn:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">This Wynn Free, this is our Monday night conference call.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is February 7<sup>th</sup>, 2011. We were just talking with Seth before we got on the air.<span>&nbsp; </span>He’d made a boo-boo last week.<span>&nbsp; </span>He played music in the background at the beginning of the call, and we couldn’t get rid of it.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">So it reminded me – here’s a story that I never told you guys.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was my first mind-blowing synchronicity in my life.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, one day I’m going to do a channeling and I’m going to ask them how did that occur?<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">I’m going to tell you this story quickly.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is an amazing story, and it has to do when I was in college I used to go back to Philadelphia.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">I was going to Berkeley, U. C. Berkeley to be a physics major.<span>&nbsp; </span>The reason I wanted to be a physics major, and I mentioned this, was that all through high school I was a ham radio operator and I had commercial radio licenses.<span>&nbsp; </span>Obviously, I was in my Atlantean technological phase, and I would come back to Philadelphia and I would work at TV stations as summer relief.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">In those days they didn’t have computers, so everything was manual.<span>&nbsp; </span>So if somebody took a vacation, they had to hire someone to do their job.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the stations was WHYY, and it was an educational radio and TV station.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was working the radio station and I remember very clearly: I used to be kind of nonchalant and arrogant, and I would be playing things and I would be calling people and chatting and chatting with my friends and doing my job.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">One evening, there was a Gilbert & Sullivan opera and it was on records and there were two turntables.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was side one on turntable one and side two on turntable two.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had to fade side one out and fade side two in.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, I was on the phone talking to some girl I was trying to impress, and I said, “Turn on your radio, I’ll make it louder” and then I would make it louder at the station, and it would go louder in her house.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was just having a jolly old time when suddenly there was a phone call from some listener who said the Gilbert & Sullivan opera was out of order.<span>&nbsp; </span>I looked down, and sure enough I played side three instead of side two.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">When you made a mistake you had to write it up and they put it on the board and everybody knew you made a mistake and I got very chewed out for making that mistake which was obviously a mistake of negligence, total negligence, on my part.<span>&nbsp; </span>So the next week there was another Gilbert & Sullivan opera, and now I was on very high alert to make no mistakes, or it could cost me my job.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again, it was side one and side two.<span>&nbsp; </span>I remember looking at side one and then I looked at side two again and then I would look at side one.<span>&nbsp; </span>It wasn’t playing yet, it was waiting to play, and I remember thinking: “I keep looking because maybe it’ll turn over if I don’t look.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I was so scared to make a mistake.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">So I play side one, and then I go into side two.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s a phone call from the very same guy that called the week before and he says, “Hey, they’re out of order” and I said I said “No, they are not.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have side two on.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He says, “Hey I’m a Gilbert & Sullivan expert.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I kept looking at it, it said side two.<span>&nbsp; </span>He said “Go pull up the script.” <span>&nbsp;</span>So in the record-thing they had a script.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sure enough, I was playing side three.<span>&nbsp; </span>Somehow or another, somehow or another, the second week they mixed up the radio labels!<span>&nbsp; </span>The labels on the <i>thing</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Side two was really side three.<span>&nbsp; </span>Can you imagine in all my life I have never, ever run into a mixed-up record label.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s the only time, and it was the week after I mixed it up.<span>&nbsp; </span>So that kept me thinking for a long time, “Was it a coincidence?” <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Did I think so hard that it would mix up that I molecularly changed things?<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, of course, I wasn’t that metaphysical at the time, but that thought definitely occurred to me, because I was thinking so hard that, “They‘re going to mix up, they’re going to revert.”<span>&nbsp; </span>So that’s one of my radio station stories.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Somebody told me that this life was actually – I was finishing up 27 lifetimes, and obviously one of the them was an Atlantean technological lifetime, another one was a troubadour and all the other things in between.<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s a scholar, a college student thinking he wanted to be a professor.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s what happens when you have a lot of unfinished business, you end up with a busy life.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Now I think I’ve found my niche – in fact, some of you that have read my material know that I’ve started getting readings, little sentence fragments in my dreams a few years ago and one of the sentence fragments said, “You finally found a job you won’t get tired of.” <span>&nbsp;</span>So I guess this is my job for the rest of my life.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">We have an interesting call tonight; I’ll stop talking about myself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Last week we had Terry’s conscious self, her conscious side, not her channeling side, share the experience that she had when she was in the hospital when her friend died, John.<span>&nbsp; </span>John’s a very evolved guy, very smart and he was a great writer and probably in the territory of Walt Whitman or Robert Frost and that kind of persona – kind of a little crotchety but wise.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Terry thinks he might have been Socrates in one of his previous lifetimes.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I read the story of Socrates I saw a lot of parallels to John, very close parallels, because John was very unusual.<span>&nbsp; </span>He didn’t want things that normal people wanted, he lived alone.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was 88 years old, he would hang out at the health-food store and he knew all the young people that worked at the health food store.<span>&nbsp; </span>That was his family; he would go there every day.<span>&nbsp; </span>That was his joy every day to hang out in the health food store.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then when Terry moved into town he would talk to Terry at least an hour a day, she would go visit him and they were like really good friends.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">So when he died, it was an unusual death because he was fairly healthy at 88 and he crashed into a building, a building on the complex where he lived, broke all his ribs.<span>&nbsp; </span>They took him to Flagstaff, which is about thirty miles away.<span>&nbsp; </span>First they thought he was going to live.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, he stated slipping away – his lungs started filling with liquid and finally Terry was there, she slept there.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was holding his hand and at the moment he passed she had an amazing experience, something that she had never experienced before.<span>&nbsp; </span>Terry, why don’t you share what happened just so that people that didn’t listen last week will know what happened… but, don’t go too long because we want to get into the question session.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">Terry:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif=""><span>&nbsp; </span>Well, the staff of the hospital was there taking very good care of him and John’s daughter was there, Jane.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was there and the first day– like he was critical when he was brought in, but then he stabilized and they thought he was going to survive.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the second day when I went back, Jane told me that he wasn’t going to survive. And that there was a process that individuals went through, in the death process, and he was not able to breathe properly because of the broken ribs, so he wasn’t able to expel the carbon dioxide.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was permeating his organs and his liver and kidneys were failing, and it was just a matter of time before he would pass away.<span>&nbsp; </span>So they put him in another room with a very beautiful view of snow capped Peaks out the window on the other side of Flagstaff.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">I kept thinking he would turn around somehow, but he wasn’t. Then I noticed that he was exterior to his body.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can see spirits, and I noticed that he was outside of his body and he was looking at Jane and I like we were a couple of aliens in a science experiment that he was doing and observing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I realized we were talking about him and excluding him from the conversation.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, I brought him into the conversation, and he went back into his body and was communicative and would answer questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>He stayed connected with us then, pretty much right up until the end.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like, just before the end he opened his eyes and I said, “Do you see the mountain?” and he nodded his head “Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">The unusual experience was after he passed, after he stopped breathing Jane asked me, “Do I see any angels?” because I had mentioned earlier that I had seen angels around him.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was one huge angel that was bigger than John and John’s 6’1”.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I told John, because I can see spirits [I could see John out of his body], I told him to let the angel show where the portal is to the tunnel of light.<span>&nbsp; </span>So the angel was showing him, and I was drawing up behind and I wanted him to make it to the other side.<span>&nbsp; </span>So the angel showed him and he went into the tunnel and I went right in behind him, because I wanted to make sure that he was getting off okay and this light was amazing.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was propelling me forward and it was moving through me, through my whole spirit, and [it was spinning slowly,] cleaning connections off.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" times="" new="" roman="" serif="">I was talking to John in the tunnel I was saying, “Go find your jazz friends” because he used to go listen to Billie Holliday and I said ,“Go find Billie Holliday.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He was on PT-boat 77 so I said, “Go find your friends from PT boat 77”, and I said, “Go find Robert Frost”, who had been a friend of his.<span>&nbsp; </span>He said, this was by telepathy, that he didn’t want to leave me.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was worried that I wouldn’t be okay if he left. So I told him that he needed to go and break trail for Jane and I and [he] needed to go first.<span>&nbsp; </span>He said “Was I sure?” and was still worried that I wouldn’t be okay and he was pausing and hesitating in the tunnel of light.<span>&nbsp; </span>I told him “Yes, I would be okay” and he needed to break trail and go find his friends.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jane said “Go find the poetry corner” because he was a poet.<span>&nbsp; </span>So he finally let go, and he went on in the tunnel of light and he was moving.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was excited about seeing his friends that he missed so much.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had to, at that point, back out of the tunnel of light because it was starting to disconnect me from my body and then I was getting disoriented because of that.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was very oriented to the tunnel.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
