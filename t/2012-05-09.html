<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Tonight we have those questions that have been submitted by those of you who are paying attention.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’ve never submitted a question and you’re listening in, please do.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even if it sounds stupid to you, even if you think it’s trivial or not important – it is.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you know why?<span>&nbsp; </span>Because you’re worthy; you’re worthy enough to have your question answered.<span>&nbsp; </span>The way they answer questions if you’ve noticed on these calls – this is not a psychic hotline – they really don’t tell you what to do; usually they don’t.<span>&nbsp; </span>They don’t make your decisions for you, they don’t dis-empower you.<span>&nbsp; </span>They have a way of addressing your questions in a way that you can look at things from a higher perspective and maybe have better tools in your own consciousness to address your own questions directly.<span>&nbsp; </span>They’ll attempt to give you those tools and tell you, “Here’s how to approach that.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes we ask questions about various phenomena that are going on the planet; sometimes we ask questions about personal issues that someone is going through.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes people submit questions about how the universe works.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s really valuable; it’s a great opportunity that we’re extending for you to ask these questions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I want to share that if you’re listening to this call, I have a feeling that we’re going to have a lot of attention focused on us in not too long, and when that happens there will be a lot more people on the call which means I’m going to be able to answer a percentage of the questions that people ask.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please take advantage before that happens and get your questions in.<span>&nbsp; </span>By asking your question, there is the opportunity to create a resonance with these sources and make an energetic connection with them which is probably the most valuable outcome of being on these calls.<span>&nbsp; </span>If that’s intriguing to you, be sure and come to our Sunday call because we focus on the energies on the Sunday call.<span>&nbsp; </span>The energies are always present on these calls, but it’s the focus so it’s stronger.<span>&nbsp; </span>A lot of people come to our Sunday call and they find that they came in depressed and they felt oppressed/depressed, and at the end of the call there was a shift inside themselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their energy shifted.<span>&nbsp; </span>That can happen on any of our calls but in particular our Sunday call because it focuses on bringing the energy in that has the most possible outcome for that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You can get the schedule for all of our calls.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know some of you have complained, “How come Wynn sends these notices out at the last minute?”<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s a good question.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think one of the reasons is, I’m so busy, as soon as I send the notice out I start getting into the energy of the call.<span>&nbsp; </span>I keep my energy clear by sending it out at the last minute; I’m not thinking about it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plus, on our Wednesday call for example, we have all the questions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You can get the schedule; that way you can anticipate the calls at conference.messageaday.net.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, you can put it on your own schedule and anticipate them instead of waiting for my messages and wondering why I didn’t send it out sooner.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Am I being a hypochondriac or do I have serious medical problems that should be looked at?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We suggest that in the area of your daily life that you take a look at how many liquids that you consume in a day, and that you make available to yourself more water as this one thing alone will help give you more energy and help to take toxins out of your body.<span>&nbsp; </span>Another thing is the toxins that are in your body due to the work that you do and the air that you breathe at times.<span>&nbsp; </span>We take a look at other aspects of your body where toxins are coming into your system.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We suggest that you are not a hypochondriac; we suggest that you are experiencing the doldrums of the lack of energy in your mitochondria – the channel is not familiar with this word.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is the area within the cell that makes the electrical charge fire within the cell.<span>&nbsp; </span>It needs to be increased in your cells of your body to increase your electrical potential within your body which is what will bring you into a heightened state of energy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We suggest that as you look at these areas compared to where you once felt and compared to where you feel now, then to figure out how to fine-tune things to get you back to the high energy state that you wish to be in and feel so good in.<span>&nbsp; </span>We suggest that there are tests that can be done to check your toxicity in your body.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can get the telephone number of someone that can do those tests reasonably for you by checking with Wynn Free.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Several things come to mind.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them is communication and to experience the joy of having such a child even though the child is speech-delayed, there are awarenesses going on within the child.<span>&nbsp; </span>The child is formulating positions and his reaction to the world; how the child may interact.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is biding time in how to interact, and it is taking stock of the lay of the land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You can be very friendly and provide a very good space for this child that the child may then begin to speak and may feel confident that the road forward is laid out and is there.<span>&nbsp; </span>The other thing is to make sure that there is very good nutrition, that the food is digested well, that there are probiotics available for the digestion tract, that there is an alkalinity within the body, that the brain is getting enough nutrients.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the nutrients the brain requires is omega oil, so we suggest making sure that the child gets enough omega oil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It is also something where you may connect up with the child, see if you can provide stories, and see if you can get the child to laugh to see what brings that child joy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One of them has to do with solar flares; how deeply, if at all, will the earth be affected by these solar flares?<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of the publicity is saying there is the potential for solar flares to knock out the grids, to knock out cell phones, to knock out electricity.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, if the solar flare is large enough, it might knock out people to the point where they burn up.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It has been said that there is a possibility of the solar flares wiping out the grid system; however, we do not see that as a probability.<span>&nbsp; </span>We do not see that, but there could be some damage to satellites, and there could be some damage to local areas of the hard-wiring on the earth as the Carrington event placed a large overload upon the wires for telegraph transmission during a solar flare cycle.</span></p>
