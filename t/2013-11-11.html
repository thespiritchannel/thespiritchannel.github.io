<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4">Terry Brown and I were sitting in the lunch room last weekend at this event in Sedona [AZ]. Terry Friedmann was across from us with this beautiful young lady and he started saying some things and I started jumping in and saying, "Wait a second". I didn't know who he was. I said "I am an expert on those things" (Wynn chuckles). I think I was a little "brash"...but somehow we ended up having a really good conversation and he came to my talk and then he gave us two books that he wrote. One of them was "</span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Man Who Walked With Jesus: Tales from the Sixth Disciple</span></i></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"</span></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4">. That [disciple] was MATTHEW. On the back of the book there were some comments on the book from...one of them was from Gladys McGarey who was the wife of Dr. McGarey who was the most renown Edgar Cayce doctor, I believe, in the country. Dr. William McGarey, was that his first name... William?</span></span></span></p>

We had a table there and of course I was very much into Edgar Cayce. I was excited to go to this show. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">[This year] it was really exciting to meet Dr. Friedmann at the event [in Sedona]. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">This is an incredible story because he believes he was Matthew--The Gospel- according to Matthew. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">I went on the internet earlier and looking for some quotes that were in the Gospel according to Matthew and let me see here if I can see...here we go, yes [here are some quotes]: </span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">"Judge not yet thee shall be judged";</span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">"Your heart will always be where your treasure is".</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Now Terry that was actually you quoting Jesus, right? Or were they from Matthew himself?</span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> So you were writing all those things down and then you put them in the Gospel of Matthew. I tell people we are not going to believe that Terry [Friedmann] was Matthew. We don't believe anything. We look for resonance. So we are going to find out his story tonight-of how he feels connected to Matthew. And if he was responsible for bringing forth some of Jesus’ greatest messages in The Gospel of Matthew. Am I right Terry?</span></span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Dr. Friedmann:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> Yes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> Why don't we start out by having you share...like how you made this connection to Matthew?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Dr. Friedmann:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> Sure! Why not? I was a practicing physician for the last thirty years. I was a Medical Doctor located in Scottsdale, Arizona and I must say my life has been very, very unique in that I have had many unique experiences and I have gotten an opportunity to go to many, many countries and do a lot of traveling as well. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">So I have had a very rare chance to be, you might say, to be educated just as Jesuha…they call him Jesuha, because we all spoke Aramaic at that time. We did not speak Hebrew or any other language. We basically spoke a tongue that is almost unknown now-it is called Aramaic. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Basically, having done this I decided that being an author is much more fun than practicing medicine all day long so when I received a calling from “Him”, in 1995, he appeared to me and asked me if I would write a book about the “True Life” that he expressed two thousand years ago! </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Now, I had always been a Christian, and in fact I am an Elder in the Church and Presbyterian as a matter of fact. I felt very connected to Him but still I had no knowledge of how deep this connection went. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">But when he appeared to me in 1995 and asked me to write a book about his life...I said: "Well I am very honored and humbled about your request however...I must say I don't know anything about your life except what I have read in the New Testament." He thought and said "You will remember." He said on top of that, "I will download while you sleep my whole life before your eyes and you are asked by me to please write this down." I said, "Well then I am just a scribe.” He said "That's correct.” He said "That's a big job". I said: "I agree, I shall take on the task.” But at that time I still had a medical practice in Scottsdale Arizona so things went very slow. So after I retired in 1997...</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> Excuse me. Terry let me ask you a question...and that is: when you had this vision of Jesus, can you share; like was it a voice in your head? Could you see? Did you have a vision of seeing him? How were you sure that it was actually Jesus, if you were [sure]?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Dr. Friedman:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> You know...even though I am analytical in my daily life, I still let my heart lead me and I knew immediately. Nobody had to tell me. I knew I had affinity. I heard him. He was talking to me just like you are talking to me now! When he's talking to me quite loudly...and this hasn't been the first time either. I've had that when I went to Egypt in '92. However, he spoke to me very clearly and distinctly and said: "You will remember, you will remember." And I had...not the time, at that time, to complete the book. So it took me seven years to write this book about his life. And he during that time...I spoke to him frequently, he would call me "Mattai." I said, "Where does that come from?" He said: "That's the Aramaic name of Matthew." So he constantly said to me: "You were Mattai, period!” I said: "Yeah, I might have been that but I don't think I was really him." "Yes you were him"! [Jesus said.]</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> (laughs)</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Dr. Friedmann:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> So...I accepted his words and wrote this book about, from my perspective as Mattai, “the Sixth Disciple”, and I remembered meeting him [Jesus] when he and Five Disciples came to a small town by Nazareth. They came into a roadway there and it immediately caught my attention. So I began to get close to him [Jesus] and learn more about him. But I indeed was a Tax Collector. I was very much a...I had a Roman heart. I liked the way the Romans lived. They had a very well educated, you might say, a view of a lot of countries. They would conquer the countries then bring back much of the culture that they had learned from those countries. So, I kind of put myself on their side and spent a lot of my time in Rome. However, once he [Jesus] asked me to join him, my whole life changed! </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">So, the book got really going when I retired in 1997 from my medical practice. I could devote to full time my creating this book. I must say that a big part of that was having purchased a beautiful cottage in a city up there in Northern Colorado, where I moved after I retired. And there by the creek I had my days cut out for me. During the night the information was "downloaded" to me. In the morning I would get up a write for hours and then walk in the National Forest up there. It's a beautiful mountain...Colorado...</span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> Now...when you got the "downloads" from Jesus did it wake up memories in you? Like did you say, "Yes, I know that?"</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Dr. Friedmann:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> Little by little it did. But the major thing that woke up my memories was actually writing the book! The first chapter is devoted to my first meeting of Jesuha [and the] five [Disciples], a motley crew. Of course, I considered myself, more sophisticated and worldly, having spent most of my time in Rome, but coming back to this town of Nazareth, and collecting taxes and so forth, I was very much aligned with the Roman concepts; the Roman ideas, and considered myself one of the better educated of the Disciples.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> Now...Jesus did this with all of his Disciples? He would just walk up to them and say: "You are supposed to come with me." And then they just went along, right?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Dr. Friedmann:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> Well...some did, and some were hesitant at first, but eventually joined the group. It wasn't spontaneous for everyone. I think it was one of my brothers, Thomas, who said something like..."Well, I have to go bury my parents" or whatever it was. Jesuha said something to the effect: "Let the dead bury the dead, come with me now."</span></span></span></p>

That he was really a guy who loved life: who played tricks on his dear Mother and he was a little bit of a...and by the way he never liked carpentry. He never got involved in carpentry [as] mentioned in the Bible or mentioned somewhere, and it is believed by many Christians that he was a real carpenter. He never liked carpentry. He just didn't feel drawn to it. He thought his work was higher than that in the sense of spiritually, the message that he had to bring to the world. It was his brother John who worked with his father in the carpentry shop. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">The other thing was...Jesus was not poor. His great uncle was Joseph of Arimathea and Joseph of Arimathea was a wealthy, wealthy trader who sailed his ships around the oceans: to India; to England; to Scotland; in fact to the United States and traded with all types of people and he got to know a lot of these countries quite well. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">In fact, the big thing was when Jesus reached twelve years of age he went with his uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, and became a "Deck Hand", and learned to be a Man and a Sailor all at once. But [he] learned along the line about people throughout the world--that was known at that time, which included, as I say, India. He learned many things from going to India as well as going to Tintagel in Northern England and he visited the Native Indians in Mexico at that time. So a lot of these things he’d found out from the wonderful education that could only be given to him by his wealthy uncle. So he wasn't poor by any means but he was in a very humble life and was never much for luxuries.</span></span></p>

This is what I remember. I remember the feeling of being married and having the dream of a wedding ring and that I was married to the Father-Son-and the Holy Ghost. And that is where I made my commitments rather than in a worldly marriage. I thought that I was married to the Father-Son and the Holy Ghost. I have other memories of that life, too and the thing with memories is that [as] you have mentioned, because you wrote the book, you remembered more and more. The things that I found, is that I remember more and more as time goes by.</span></span></span></p>

Not only that, before I published this book in 2002 I decided to go on a trip to Israel and see for myself the places we had visited and see what it is like today and I did do that. That brought things to a real foundation or meaning to me because I saw things as they are today and then I remembered more things about how they were before, when I actually saw Peter’s house, and so on and so forth, which is said to still be standing. So when I saw these things and sailed on the Sea of Galilee, it opened up a lot to me. And my memory came back a lot quicker at that time. So right before I finished the book I did include that as a final chapter, so that really made a big difference into bringing everything to me at that time, meeting some herdsmen, who spoke Aramaic and lived in the tents of the skins of animals and went around the villages and went throughout the country feeding their animals. This also helped me gain a lot of knowledge about the language and much of my work at that time or play if you want to look at Jesus. We were more serious than he [Jesus] was I think. He had his hands full teaching these twelve dumb guys about life, I think. What it [life] is all about, because we were certainly going against the grain, when we began to discuss these things.</span></span></span></p>

We were from the cities there, Nazareth or whatever but Judas was brought in from Jerusalem. And he had a different agenda, God love him, he had one of the toughest jobs there. I say that because his idea was: "Hey, we should challenge Jesus here publicly and he will stand up and break through the bars of the prisons and show that he is stronger than anything...well, we can chase the Romans out of our country who are now occupying the state of Israel.” This was his belief and he was very, very defined on that belief, that, that was the way things were. But, he was only one of the twelve of us and we all had slightly different perspectives on things. As I said, myself, I was kind of aligned with the Roman Empire so that didn't interest me at all, what his ideas were.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> I have heard this story before about Judas because normally it's historically he is thought of the guy that betrayed Jesus for silver, but in fact, I have heard two other stories. One was that he wanted to put Jesus on the line so Jesus would stand up and the whole world would recognize him. Which, is what you are saying and the other was that Jesus in fact wanted this to happen because it was a way that he would reach people.</span></span></span></p>

Well that is unique about him, that he was crucified, ascended and quite different than the other. I do know, death by the cross was quite common in that day. It wasn't just the three people on the hill overlooking- Jerusalem, a lot of people were crucified. If they tried to challenge the conquerors –the Romans, they were put to death! It is a very painful way-hung on the cross. So being on a cross is not particularly fun but it certainly wasn't uncommon and Jesus kept telling me...today he said: "Whatever you do, take me down from that cross, I don't want to be up there, I don't want to be known as the guy on the cross, I want to be known for the Message I brought to the world which is: WE ARE ALL ONE-WE ARE ALL CHILDREN OF GOD. That is the important thing!" Not, not the message that: he died on the cross to save our sins. He said, “No, I didn't save your sins. I am not your sin savior, I am your SERVANT!” He told me that many times. "I am your SERVANT, I am not here to save you from yourself or the things you do...you have to deal with that...I am here as your SERVANT to help you see things more clearly."</span></span></span></p>

He was put in the tomb of his great uncle. Joseph of Aramathea had saved that tomb and he was placed in there and then obviously he came down out of that tomb. He had the Shroud still around him. The Shroud of Turin is actually the factual Shroud that he wore and eventually that truth will be brought out. Right now there is some controversy of the view of the people who have control of that Shroud and by the way there is two pieces. There is a Facial Shroud and then there is a Body Shroud. So he basically claimed to me: "That is my correct Shroud, and you will find when your analysis is improved, you will find evidence of the frankincense oil still on that Shroud”-that he was prepared in death with, by the [two] Marys--Mother Mary and his TWIN FLAME, Mary Magdelene.</span></span></span></p>

In fact on the painting of The Last Supper he is sitting next to Jesuha. He looks very feminine, he was very feminine but he's really a good guy and Mary was introduced to him by Jesus when [Jesus] was on the cross saying "Mother behold your son; son behold your mother." He [Jesus] knew that he could trust John. So what he [John] did, he took, when things got tough after [Jesus’] crucifixion he [John] took her [Mother Mary] to Turkey and went to a city of Ephesus in Turkey and got a place for her on the mountain top overlooking Ephesus. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">Ephesus used to be a Roman city in Turkey at sea coast that was eventually silted in and is abandoned now today. But they are finding lots of interesting things in the library there and they are only about 3 to 5% uncovered by archaeological digs but it’s very marvelous finding of this life time when a lot of people respected Ephesus. But he put her in a mountain top retreat above Ephesus looking down over Ephesus so she could go down when she needed supplies and that's where she was for the last eight years of her life.</span></span></p>

But I will say this, he did not practice. He did not practice it. He was really was committed to Jesuha's needing to get the word out; the message out through the healing, when we went around the country doing our healing; doing our work in the villages where we were generally well received by the people at that time. But we also had at times a very large entourage with us of people who were looking after us and making sure we had everything right, that everything was cooked properly and just the way that Jesuha liked it, and the times we did not spend in the house at night, we had the company of all these wonderful people who followed us where ever we went.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> I'll tell you a story that: years ago, I had a teacher that I was very influenced by. I would say he was the best...you know at one period of my life I was going to Yogis and Masters and Gurus and reading everything and this one guy was awesome! He would give a talk and I could feel the energy land in the room. I could feel my depressions going away; I could feel there was something in his presence and I think I had that experience with him. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Times New Roman, serif" style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span size="4">In recent times I show up and do things and people feel similar energy as I felt around this guy. He was like a role model. He used to say that he was, John -The Beloved, and I used to think “Maybe he was”, because of his ability to bring in this wonderful energy into the space! And probably about twelve or fifteen years into it he got into deep "doo doo" because it came out that he was having relationships with the four guys that were his assistants and they all got mad at him! So it is very interesting that you said: "John -The Beloved was gay.” It was really interesting because I don't think that anyone really...well there are people if you look on the Internet, there are people that mention it. And then some people say they thought that Jesus was having a connection with John- the Beloved. None the less, this guy, was awesome in his ability to transmute spirit and bring it into the room. I don't want to say who he is because his work got very damaged, because of this "gay thing" that came out and a lot of people left him because of it. But it is very interesting that you mentioned that.</span></span></p>

Even though Jesuha and Joseph really enjoyed the wonderful tropical breezes, I think when they were sitting on the beach; they tried to influence the heads of the Mayan group or the Aztec group. I think it was before the Aztecs came about. The Aztecs were a break off of the Mayans. They tried to tell them that "God doesn't expect or doesn't even want or doesn't care for any of their sacrifices...that is wrong!” "Whether it be [sacrificing] animal or man, it is wrong!” “Let’s stop doing that!” That was the message that Jesuha and Joseph of Aramathea gave to these elders of the Mayan population who were at that time in Southern Mexico.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Dr. Friedmann:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> &nbsp;We had great discussions about that because some of us were Vegetarians and others were not. So he said "that is up to the source, to you guys, whatever you want to do, whatever you feel right about, you can be a Vegetarian or not. It is okay, because, we indeed rule these animals of our planet; however, we’ve got to respect them, and to be kind to them.” We ate fish, things of that nature. So most of us were not vegetarian but we were people that enjoyed the typical meal; yogurt and things of this nature of that time. Garbanzo beans that stuff, we ate that a lot, and as I say we ate the fish...so that is what we ate.</span></span></span></p>

God’s natural healing pharmacy is our plants and our oils, and I have pretty much been promoting that in Medicine. So I am kind of a different Doctor, even though I have treated many of the...whatever works I use it!</span></span></span></p>

Mary Magdelene was his TWIN FLAME. He is with her today. And do you know what a TWIN FLAME is? TWIN FLAMES are two souls that actually join to become one and one is the mirror image of the other. So if I am thinking: "Golly we need to go to the show tonight," TWIN FLAME may say; "I want to stay home and watch TV." So you deal with that. You work out a relationship...but yeah, Mary Magdelene was his TWIN FLAME. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"><b>Wynn:</b></span></span><span face="Times New Roman, serif"><span size="4"> Now was Jesus...was it his idea, not to put that in the Bible?</span></span></span></p>

They had a child, by the way. They had a child and Mary Magdelene took the [child]...after his [Jesus's] death she was seven months pregnant. The child was not born yet. When after his death she went on complaining that: "He left me and I am pregnant" and "bla,bla,bla". But eventually a beautiful female child was born by the name of SARAH and she [Mary Magdelene] eventually took that child and went to France with that child, and became part of the "ruling energy" there in France. </span></span></span></p>
