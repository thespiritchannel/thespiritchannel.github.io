This is our internet conference call - if</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">you hear that noise in the background – what’s your name?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Kelly</strong>:&nbsp; Kelly.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Kelly.&nbsp; If you listen to my conference call tonight,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">you’re going to be on it.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Kelly:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Anna Lee is our host, we have three hosts here: we have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">the heavenly host, we have Wynn the earthly host and we have Anna</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Lee who is the Starbucks host.&nbsp; Right?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Kelly:</strong>&nbsp; That’s right.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; That’s right.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Kelly:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Will I be able to go online?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Sign up to everything I told you about.&nbsp; You’ll</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">get all kinds of messages and you can listen in.&nbsp; Are you ready?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Kelly</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp; I would be very interested.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I know you would; send me an email if you sign up and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">I’ll make sure you get everything down right.&nbsp; You know how we</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">put crystal kids in the light?&nbsp; Anna Lee is an undiscovered</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">crystal kid.&nbsp; Come here a second.&nbsp; She’s never heard this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">before but I can tell them.&nbsp; I should take a picture of you.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Let’s see if I can take a picture.&nbsp; I can take a picture, this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">is new here.&nbsp; There she is – she’s very photogenic.&nbsp; Those of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">you who are listening, when we send out the replays we’ll make</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">sure we send out a picture.&nbsp; We got her.&nbsp; I hope.&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; So,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">crystal - what it is: our planet is going through this big shift</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">right now.&nbsp; A lot of kind of angelic beings came in from higher</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">realms to help with the shift, but once they’re here they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">don’t remember.&nbsp; That’s what a crystal kid is.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Kelly:</strong>&nbsp; For the past week, I’ve been dreaming about the end of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">the world.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Okay, come into our conference calls, don’t tell that to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">everybody.&nbsp; I’m on the air.&nbsp; Terry are you there?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> I’m here.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> You’re there?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> I’m right here, yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Actually there’s more to it.&nbsp; When you start coming into</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">our calls you’ll understand the big picture okay?&nbsp; Yeah, this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">is the big picture; this will fill in the dots.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Kelly</strong>:&nbsp; It’s scary.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; This is why you’re here, I think.&nbsp; Check it out and see</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">if it makes sense, okay?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Kelly:&nbsp;</strong> Okay.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; In any case, we do this three times a week, so you can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">call in, you can say hello to everybody, you’ll feel connected</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">to everything, okay.&nbsp; Just make sure you figure out everything. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">I have to get back to work.&nbsp; This is not work, but you know. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">That’s right here at Starbucks on 17 Freeway on the way to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Phoenix.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">What we’re going to do today, if you got my email which I sent</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">out five minutes before the show, so you probably didn’t, but</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">– I wanted to have a conversation with—how did I put the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">headline: do you recognize the boogeyman?&nbsp; If you watch movies,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">in movies the boogey man is always recognizable because he looks</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">really bad.&nbsp; He looks scary; he looks like he’s going to get</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">you.&nbsp; But in reality, the boogey man most often, or very often,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">does not look scary, and in fact he looks like something or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">someone you’d really like to know.&nbsp; Jesus kind of called it</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">correctly when he – I believe it was Jesus, he talked about the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">wolf in sheep’s clothing.&nbsp; In the course of the last seven or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">eight years, I’ve learned a lot about boogey men, how they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">work, the reality of them – probably more than I want to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">completely share on this call.&nbsp; I do want to share enough so that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">you guys have some idea what is out there and what could present</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">itself to you and perhaps learn to how to think twice.&nbsp; As much</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">as we’re committed to being here, at some point we probably</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">won’t and you’re going to be on your own, at some point in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">the future.&nbsp; I need to make sure you have the tools to know how</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">to cope and how to discern if that point comes.&nbsp; I think it’s a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">little noisy here so I’m going to try to find a more quiet</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">spot.&nbsp; This is Wynn and Terry on 17 Freeway in Camp Verde.&nbsp; Here</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">we go – we’ll try this, it’s a more quiet spot.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">So I’m going to share, I’ll take a few minutes and share a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">little bit about some of the things I’ve learned about the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">negative.&nbsp; If you’ve studied the Carla Rueckert material, she</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">says - she doesn’t call it ‘positive’ and ‘negative’,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">she calls it service-to-self and service-to-others.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">distinctions of service-to-self and service-to-others go up very,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">very high in the realms.&nbsp; In fact, they can both go equally high</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">up to one point, and that one point comes when the Law of One</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">activates and the Law of One by the time you hit the Law of One,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">there’s no more hierarchy because everyone’s part of you. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">How can there be hierarchy when it’s all you?&nbsp; If you are of a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">negative path and you’re going up into high negative, you can</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">go all the way to the top and you might think you might have to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">fall back and start over again if you’re going to go positive,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">but that’s no really true.&nbsp; You can just switch.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">How does the negative work, and why is it that according to Carla</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Rueckert to move through the realms of the negative you need to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">be 95% negative but to move through the realms on the positive</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">you only need to be 51%.&nbsp; Why are those numbers those numbers –</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">why is that?&nbsp; I thought about that for a long time to figure that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">out for myself and I kind of think I intuitively got it.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">deal with the negative is that it constantly has to absorb energy</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">from that which is below it.&nbsp; It doesn’t get energy from that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">which is above it.&nbsp; It needs to manipulate everything and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">everyone under its umbrella, including the positive.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">doesn’t care whether you’re positive or negative.&nbsp; It just</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">cares if it can get your energy pointed in its direction.&nbsp; If you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">get enough energy pointed in your direction, you can then evolve</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">through the realms in a constant kind of ‘manipulation’ I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">guess is the right word, to get energy.&nbsp; The thing about the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">negative is that when it stops getting energy, it suddenly goes</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">empty.&nbsp; There’s not a lot of room for self-contemplation, for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">long walks by yourself – maybe there is, I don’t know.&nbsp; But,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">there’s emptiness.&nbsp; Because, as soon as the energy stops coming</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">towards you, it’s empty so you need more – you need more. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">That’s why you need you such a high percentage of being</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">service-to-self to keep moving upwards, because as soon as the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">energy is not hitting you, you’re empty.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">Service-to-others allows you to feel energy – I won’t say</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">‘all the time’ – but, a higher percentage of the time</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">because, if no one is pointing energy towards you, you can still</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">connect with energy.&nbsp; You can connect with energy empathetically.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;You can watch television and feel people.&nbsp; You can walk down the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">street and feel people without trying to organize their energy,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">whereas - a service-to-self person would be always attempting to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">organize energy and pointing energy towards it.&nbsp; It’s not</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">obvious when people are doing that.&nbsp; It’s not obvious because</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">they can be presenting things of great value to you.&nbsp; When I say</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">people I don’t mean just people; I mean people and spirits. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">There were a couple of times with Terry where we had spirit-forms</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">come in of famous names, and when we asked them to leave, they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">wouldn’t leave.&nbsp; Do you want to tell that story – let’s not</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">say the name of the entity – Terry, are you on? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; I’m here.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Don’t say the name, just say what happened. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> I won’t say the name…</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I had gone to a talk, right, and somebody was channeling</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that entity – is that right?&nbsp; And then when I came back they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">were trying to come through – I can’t remember.&nbsp; You tell the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">story, okay? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Okay.&nbsp; This entity, we were channeling and this entity</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">tried to come through and would just bust into the comm line,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">just bust into the frequency.&nbsp; I said I didn’t want to channel</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that entity, and it just tried anyway to come on in and we had to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">end the session.&nbsp; I had another time, it was a different entity</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">and it came in and there was a question somebody asked about a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">certain entity and the entity came in and was very enthusiastic. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">We explained to the entity that we weren’t channeling that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">entity right then and we didn’t want to, and it just kept on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">trying to get through and so we had to end session then, too. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">But the first entity I had felt was negative; the second entity I</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">had felt that may have been positive, but we were not channeling</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that entity right then and we wanted to stay on track with what</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">we were doing. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; But, he didn’t want to leave, right?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> He didn’t want to leave, no.&nbsp; He just kept on and on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">and so we ended session.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; So that was an example of that entity not honoring free</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">will.&nbsp; Actually that particular entity is quite renowned.&nbsp; Many</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">people channel him; I don’t know if it’s that entity.&nbsp; He</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">said it was that entity.&nbsp; We felt it was that entity.&nbsp; In</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">channeling, there’s a great deal of mystery involved where you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">don’t really…&nbsp; it’s not like you go and meet somebody and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">you see their face and you say, “Oh, that’s Wynn” or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">“That’s Terry” or “That’s Gjis”.&nbsp; You’ve got</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">invisible realms and voices, and somebody says they’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">somebody.&nbsp; You would have to assume that the negative is going to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">say they’re somebody and not be who they say.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">One of the things with people who channel is very often they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">become endeared with their own channelings.&nbsp; In fact, this is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">something to look at with channeling – look at the person who</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">is channeling.&nbsp; Does that person relish the recognition?&nbsp; Are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">they attached to the attention that’s being paid to them? </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Because if they are attached to the attention that’s being paid</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">to them, there’s a good chance that there is some mixed</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">polarity potential, which means a negative source could come</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">through them.&nbsp; Once you’re attached to the attention, you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">become attached to pleasing people.&nbsp; Once you become attached to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">pleasing people, then it’s like “What can I share with you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that you’re going to like?”&nbsp; And, once I’m doing that,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">there’s a compromise in the energy, in the intent on my part. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">And, that compromise, mine or Terry’s, allows the potential for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">a negative source.&nbsp; When a negative source comes in, they then</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">will do things to lead people astray.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">If you read The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce there’s the whole</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">story of the negative source that came through Cayce as indicated</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">in the book.&nbsp; In this particular care, I am fairly sure that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">channeling was accurate, the information from Wilcock.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">reason was, thirty years ago when I read Edgar Cayce and there</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">was this doomsday prophecy about everything falling into the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">ocean.&nbsp; Then there was, a little bit later, in another channeling</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">it said, “These changes will come gradually.”&nbsp; Man! That</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">stuck in my mind.&nbsp; I said, “Why is there a doomsday prophecy,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">and then later these changes will come gradually?”&nbsp; Then</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Wilcock, if you read The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce there’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">the section where they actually talk about that, and say that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">source with the doomsday prophecy was negative.&nbsp; If enough people</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">make a doomsday prophecy and talk about it, that actually is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">creating a consensus reality that can bring it about.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">amazing thing that we who are checking into this line are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">learning that there are not things that are destined to occur;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">there are things that we are creating to occur – we as humans,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">as a collective.&nbsp; If we change the way we create, then future</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">events will happen differently. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">When people make prophecies, it’s based on energies of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">collective that have been happening for many years.&nbsp; For example,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">if Edgar Cayce made that prophecy and people repeat it over and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">over again, it’s putting energy into that prophecy.&nbsp; Terry and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">I had a private channeling lately and we were talking about some</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">of this stuff and they were saying how incredibly powerful it was</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">when people would be assuming something would be happening and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">were talking about it as if it was happening.&nbsp; If somebody today</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">says something prophetically, that something is going to happen,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">then that person is actually casting their vote for that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">particular thing to happen.&nbsp; In the highest truth, there is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">nothing that has to happen except what we create.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Before I get emails saying I talk too much, are you ready</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Terry?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Yeah.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I’m in public place outside on a patio, and Terry</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">is in the car so she’s kind of in an energetic space.&nbsp; We’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">going to talk about boogey men.&nbsp; The fact that I call them</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">‘boogey men’ is almost a wrong way to identify it because</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that immediately says fear, devil, run, hide, don’t get me, the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">boogey man is going to get you.&nbsp; So let me apologize for using</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that word and correct it to a word which is less loaded.&nbsp; We’ll</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">call it just the negative, the service-to-self.&nbsp; The bottom line</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">is, there are people, there are energies, there are spirits –</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that will trap you.&nbsp; You don’t know you’re trapped until</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">it’s too late often times.&nbsp; You need to be able to identify</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">these things before you get trapped and know how to go the other</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">direction and shut the energies down.&nbsp; I’m going to call in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">light: </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the light to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">surround and protect Terry, myself and everyone on this line and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">everyone who listens to the replays.&nbsp; We now see the energy</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">radiating from the center of the universe, through the galaxies,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">through our galaxy, through the solar system, through the outer</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">energies of the earth, through our bodies and into the center of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">the earth.&nbsp; Right now, we invoke a group energy connection for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">all those who would free-willingly choose to participate on this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">line.&nbsp; We invite those source that are positive,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">service-to-others to join with us and we create a protected a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">space that only the positive has access to, and anything not of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that nature must leave now.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">Take a moment and shut your eyes, feel the energy.&nbsp; While we’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">feeling it, let’s send it to Carla Rueckert, to everyone who is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">listening to this that needs a healing; to Caroline Sabin who is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">in the hospital in London; to Dee’s husband; and anyone else. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Put it in your consciousness - see them in your space and send</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">them this love light energy.&nbsp; Do we have an introductory comment</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">on how to avoid getting trapped by the negative?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Creator.&nbsp; This is Ra’an, April 11th 2011, through BBS Radio and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">the conference call.&nbsp; Welcome to everybody who will listen to the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">call later or read any transcripts.&nbsp; We send you love and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">greetings and warmth and caring, and we are here to answer your</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">questions and we have a few comments to make on the negative.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">One of the things that happens in the third density is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">individuals enter into duality.&nbsp; Are they going to go on the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">trip, are they not gong to go on the trip?&nbsp; Are they going to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">plant a garden, are they not going t plant a garden?&nbsp; Are they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">going to live to be a hundred, or are they not going to live to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">be a hundred?&nbsp; There is a duality when one checks into the third</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">density, and it is this duality that is the germinating seeds for</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">negativity.&nbsp; The animal spirits who is in a ‘cat mode’ who is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">attempting to make the kill, to have the food, to be able to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">survive.&nbsp; So living in the third density places one in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">jeopardy of coming in contact with negativity.&nbsp; There is a flip</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">side to things in the third density, and it is a very good</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">exercise for an individual who goes into the third density to be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">able to live and learn to have the discipline to bring through</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">love light in circumstances and enter love light into their life</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">and make the connection between their home base, their true</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">nature and the animal nature that they come in contact with in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">the third density.&nbsp; Do you have questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; It seems to me that one of the ways – I can say that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">I’ve been around for quite some time in this realm.&nbsp; In the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">past eight years, I have learned things beyond the scope of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">anything I could even image I would have learned to the point</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">where I believe I have some idea of how things work.&nbsp; I don’t</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">believe if I had this learning experience that I would be immune</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">from connecting with something negative and getting tricked.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">seems like it’s a little unfair, because it’s so</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">sophisticated the way the negative works, unless somebody comes</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">into something like this and hears some signs of things to look</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">for, they could easily get hooked.&nbsp; It seems to me that the way</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">the negative hooks you is through creating obligation of some</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">sort or another.&nbsp; I know obligation is necessary for 3D life -</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">there’s agreements that people make – landlords and tenants</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">and husbands and wives.&nbsp; There’s obligation.&nbsp; How can you tell</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">when it’s okay to enter into an obligation and there’s not a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">negative thing on the other side, sucking you in to trap you?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> This is a good question, as there is that survival</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">side, wherein individuals tend to wish to suck energy in to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">increase their own survival as they have forgotten that their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">life is not all that exists, and they think that their life is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">all that exists.&nbsp; So, they attempt to bring energy to themselves,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">and money and power and to increase their own survival while they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">can.&nbsp; They feel that there is no path that moves into future</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">time, and will carry them past death, and into a transition and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">into a rebirth, and into a whole new life.&nbsp; So one needs to be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">alert and to watch for the signs that they have been led in to a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">one way street. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">One can be alert in their contacts with others that the others</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">are service-to-other people.&nbsp; Do they pull energy only to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">themselves for their own betterment and give energy as a lure or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">bait to pull in more energy, or do they selflessly give?&nbsp; What is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">their viewpoint of self?&nbsp; Do they see others as part of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">themselves, or do they see themselves as a separate entity that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">is separated and not connected and of a more isolated nature, or</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">do they connect with others and give and take?&nbsp; There is a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">feeling one can get in the connection with others of whether</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">these others are service-to-others or service-to-self.&nbsp; We say</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that not everything all the time will go correctly, and when one</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">thinks that they have been drawn in to move to get out of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">situation and to reestablish themselves as there are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">service-to-other people out there (with whom) the give and take</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">will be of great significance.&nbsp; </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; There are some very overt service-to-self things, maybe</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">perhaps like a mob.&nbsp; I don’t want to use the word of a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">particular mob, but you know what I mean – a mob that extorts</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">money, that’s engaged in stuff that loans you money and then</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">controls you for the rest of your life.&nbsp; We’ve all seen that on</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">TV and I believe it works that way in real life and that once</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">you’re under their auspices, you can’t get out.&nbsp; That’s one</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">kind of obligation of service-to-self hooking somebody.&nbsp; Then</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">there’s another kind of service-to-self which is more of an –</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">I’ll just describe this and let them comment on it.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">We had a whole session on entrainment, how when you pay attention</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">to something, you’re giving energy to it and when you’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">giving energy to something there’s a back-and-forth energy and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">there’s an entrainment where your energy falls into a certain</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">level of the hologram, depending on the level of entrainment. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">That can be very positive or very negative, depending.&nbsp; For</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">example, we do these calls three times a week.&nbsp; If you’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">listening three times a week and if you’re reading our material</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">there’s a fairly good chance you’re getting entrained to a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">certain energy which is connected from very high celestial realms</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">which will teach you how to make those connections for yourself</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">over time.&nbsp; That would be a kind of entrainment – an</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">entrainment into high realms of spirit.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">Then you could take somebody like a Hitler who is charismatic and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">who can stand in front of a group of people and move them very</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">emotionally, and even will lift their spirits, but yet he’s</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">entraining them into service-to-self mission where he convinced</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">millions of people that it was okay to exterminate Jews.&nbsp; In that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">case, the people are not getting involved in an obligatory</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">relationship like with the mob, but they’re getting entrained</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">to a service-to-self frequency and I would imagine that if you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">allow that to occur for you, it will greatly impact your future</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">lifetimes.&nbsp; But I don’t know, because I can’t see that. </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">That’s the question I would ask – if a person has allowed to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">get into the entrainment frequencies of a service to self being,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">how did that impact them when they leave this realm?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An</strong>:&nbsp; If one follows the energy trail, and they are used to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">getting their energy from a service-to-self pattern, they are</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">unlikely to change unless they change while they are still in the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">third density.&nbsp; However, if they move into the transition period</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">after their physical body passes away and they are used to this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">pattern, they may still try to suck energy from others and they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">may, whatever choice they make as to their future - after their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">body passes on, they will still carry this pattern until the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">point where they would see the need to change the pattern, and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">change the pattern.&nbsp; They would likely come back to reinstate the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">pattern with friends that they had been in a pattern with before.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;Look at what is the payback with energy? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">Often, their desire to bring energy to them from others is based</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">on a lack of self worth, where they do not give themselves credit</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">and they do not give themselves love and they do not honor and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">respect their own being and they attempt then to collect energy</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">from others into their space to give them selves worth.&nbsp; This</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">will never work, as it is trying to fill up an empty hole that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">devours all the energy and does not replace it with self worth,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">self-giving, self-love.&nbsp; So there is a bottom line to begin to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">find things that one can give themselves credit for, as that they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">are the source of their power and to begin to love themselves and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">like a flower that has been wilted, to become strong and to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">regain its stature and then, and only then, can they truly give</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">and take.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; A fine refinement of this is - I have observed</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">with my own eyes many very beautiful people who are members of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">churches that I believe at the top of the church they’re</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">guided, the church is guided, by negative sources.&nbsp; When you have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">somebody who is a totally loving and self – apparently –</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">loving themselves and feeling worthy, but as a member of a church</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">or organization that has a negative source at its core, how does</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that impact the karmic development of that person?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> The individual can grow; whoever can be stifled at a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">certain level that ii is hard to grow beyond, because the part of</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">the organization is taking energy so the individual may try very,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">very hard to give energy, to give service and may feel a limit in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">their growth because, at a certain point, the relationship</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">between the individual and the part of the organization is a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">dead-end and the individual cannot move past the limitation set,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">an example set, by the heart of the organization.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; So one has to be rather careful about their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">affiliations with organizations?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An</strong>:&nbsp; Yes.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; It’s 6:49 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; How about affiliations with people? </span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Let’s suppose you’re a service-to- other orientation person</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">and you suddenly marry a person who is very service-to-self.&nbsp; How</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">is that going to impact your karmic evolution?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> It depends upon your reaction to it.&nbsp; If one has a</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">tendency, if they have gone into a relationship and are taking</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">vows and commitments to that individual, they may limit their own</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">growth and keep trying to bring the other person up to their</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">level.&nbsp; However, their level is limited by the level of the other</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">person that they have chosen to spend so much time and commitment</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">with.&nbsp; If they don’t move out of that relationship, but stay in</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that relationship, it could set a limit upon the amount of growth</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that they can have.&nbsp; However, even so, they could realize, be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">aware, of that limitation and then allow and grant beingness to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">that other person to be as they are, and to give them love and</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">caring and yet to redefine themselves in other spheres that they</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">may continue to grow spiritually, and connecting with the higher</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">realms, and learning and getting disciplines within their own</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">being and learning to love themselves and to simply treat the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">relationship as a matter of fact; it is what it is, and to</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">provide stability for the other person in spite of the detriment</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">of the other person being service-to-self.&nbsp; In other words, to be</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">able to co-exist non-linearly with a faction that is of a lesser</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">mode of operation.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I’ve seen this work for certain people, where they have</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">a relationship based on security and maybe a sexual interchange,</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">but the person who is more evolved will go out and seek spiritual</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">groups and things to participate with outside of the</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">relationship.&nbsp; The relationship is actually giving them a certain</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">grounding stability so that they can do that.&nbsp; I’ve seen that</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">happen a number of times with people.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;">It’s 6:52 p.m., 6:53.&nbsp; I’m going to say we have to stop this</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">call right now.&nbsp; Thank you so much for the insight on this topic.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;Before we hang up do you want to say goodbye to everybody who is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">listening on BBS and on replays?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Callers:</strong>&nbsp; Bye BBS.&nbsp; Goodbye and thank you.&nbsp; Bye.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you all for helping to hold the energy.&nbsp; This is</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Monday; Wednesday we take questions at messageaday.net, if you</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">have questions send them in.&nbsp; We may ask your question.</span><br /><br /><br /></p>
