<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transcription<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ra'An for August 24, 2011<br /><br /><br />This is Wednesday, August 24, 2011 and my name is Wynn Free<br />and my co-host is Terry Brown.<br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> It is very important that each person <span style="font-size: medium;">make</span> their own<br />evaluation of what is true. <br /><br />The best relationship with our Sources is to be friends. This <br />is a friendship with a subtle energy but the best friends have <br />a silent understanding. They know each other, they are there <br />for each other. You don't have to put on a good face for a real <br />friend and if you are having a bad day, they don't care, they <br />are still you're friend, they still give you a support, it's unconditional. <br />So one of the great things about these guys is that they are that way, but<br />they are an energy friend and it's not like you have to be<br />perfect, in fact you don't have to be perfect. Come as you<br />are, just live your life with high intent and integrity. Even<br />the dark parts, because we all have dark parts, do not exclude<br />you from their friendship. <br /><br />How you deal with your dark parts could exclude you. If <br />you hate someone because they did something to you and <br />you do something that is hateful. So learning how to deal <br />with your shadow side is a very important aspect of the human <br />condition and the evolving human. Learning how to observe <br />it by letting it come up whether it's depression, or hate or jealousy. <br />All the range of human emotions and don't judge yourself. Just <br />put it in the light.<br /><br />If you have this model that you are a perfect person then you<br />will cover them up and feel guilty about them. You will not<br />deal with those things and they will just remain in your<br />consciousness.<br /><br />So you learn how to lift your energy above that. Our Sources<br />provide a lot of tools to help us. They are already here<br />listening to us and we will start out by calling in the light.<br /><br /><br />(Wynn calls in the light)<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite<br />Creator. This is the 24th of August, 2011 on planet earth and<br />we are pleased to make the connection with each and every<br />person on this line and we are delighted for the connection<br />between each one of you and what you might call home. The home<br />where individuals are whole and are loved and are worthy and<br />are honored. Do you have questions?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Yes. I am going to start out with a question from Zoe.<br />She asks, I understand the moon has a steady influence on<br />humans and can you help us understand it's influence on human<br />beings. She asks, how can we show our appreciation to the moon<br />and I would like to ask is there any benefit to showing appreciation <br />to the moon?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />There is a live intelligence in All That Is, so appreciation<br />increases loving connection. So, it does pay to give appreciation<br />to the moon. The way that it influences one is to help them<br />ground within the field as there is a gravitational pull on<br />each being. This gravitational pull is increased in times<br />when the moon is close to the earth and at times when the moon<br />is not shadowed by the shadow of the earth. The earth and the<br />moon have a connection that helps set the rhythms of the earth<br />and it is a loving connection. That is our answer.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />I would like to add a question to that. In some of the<br />internet sites and in the research I have done , it was<br />indicated that at one point there was no moon and that the moon<br />was towed into it's orbit by ET's, and the moon is an<br />artificial satellite. Historically, if we go back to Egypt,<br />there was the Amon god and the Aten god, and Amon related to the<br />moon and Aten related to the sun, and in general it indicated<br />that the sun god was far superior to the moon god, bigger in<br />it's hologram, and that the moon god was responsible for Amon<br />Ra, for example, which was connected to service to self. Can you<br />give a discourse on any of that which feels relevant and that<br />we can make use of?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> The matter that makes up the moon and the gaseous<br />nature of the sun is different. The moon is more congealed<br />into solid matter, the sun is more gaseous, and&nbsp; liquid and changing. They<br />have different influences upon the people of earth. The sun is<br />very life giving by nature of it's rays, it's heat. It gives<br />life to the whole solar system. We do not look at the moon or<br />the sun as being superior. They have different roles and<br />functions. One may move into a system of thinking wherein they<br />honor the sun, since it is such a life giving factor, and look<br />at it as being more of a hero or more of a friend than say,<br />the moon.&nbsp; However, it is all part of the solar system and operates<br />all together. Without the sun, the solar system would have<br />less life in the 3rd density. The moon as we look at it,<br />affects the earth and is a balance for it's rotation, and in<br />earlier times it was able to be moved into a certain orbit to<br />counterbalance the earth as a further anchoring system for<br />earth, that could be moved and could be a blessing and a<br />protection to the earth, and a protection from foreign bodies<br />moving into earth. However that was a civilization of a very<br />long time ago that was destroyed as Mars was depleted of life<br />and another planet within the solar system was blown up. Much<br />technology and knowledge of how to make life easier and<br />control weather patterns within the earth plane and in Mars<br />was lost. Those are our comments.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />Edna has a question. We have been taught, and this is not<br />something we can directly validate, that there are millions of<br />star seeds and millions of Wanderers on this planet. (Wynn: Let me<br />just make a comment that star seeds and Wanderers are entities<br />from higher dimensions, that would not normally be required to<br />take a body karmically, but have chosen (volunteered) to come<br />here to either experience what it feels like down here, or to<br />be of service. In general star seeds originate from the Elohim,<br />and Wanderers originate from the Ra Group; two different group<br />souls.) This question is what about the rest of the people who<br />are not star seeds or Wanderers. Where do they come from?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you for your question. There is a time factor<br />involved in all of this and many individuals who you would not<br />call star seeds or Wanderers are individuals that have<br />originally, many, many ancient periods of time ago, moved into<br />the physical realm and have gotten stuck in the cycle of<br />reincarnation and are working through things. They do not<br />appear to have the same abilities as star seeds and Wanderers<br />as they seem to have lost them over time. Many times when you<br />see the person who is incapacitated in intellect or in<br />physicality, they have gotten into karmic situations which<br />they are working through, and have lost sight of their origins. All <br />individuals have come from the other side.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> How about those beings that were genetically created or<br />worked on by the Annunaki, where they bred ape genes and<br />Annunaki genes and humans were the result?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> There are individuals who are mainly of the body system<br />and are working on the intellect, and the systems of energy and<br />matrices within the body, that do not have a star seed or<br />Wanderer or other individual that is guiding, and these<br />individuals are working within their own body system to<br />progress through life. They do not have the same dimension of<br />foresight and adaptability as others and they may not live as<br />long.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> What percentage of our planet's population might be of<br />people who fit this category, who are not starseeds or Wanderers <br />who are indigenous to the earth, those who were mixed with ape<br /> genes and Annunaki?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We do not see the question as quite clear as there have<br />been star seeds and Wanderers both who inhabited these human<br />bodies who were instigated by these Annunaki and they used<br />apes and the Annunaki to foster, to plant a more adaptable<br />human who could withstand the higher density of the earth<br />atmosphere, and others from other planets did not survive very<br />well in this atmosphere, so the majority of individuals of star<br />seeds and Wanderers have taken these human bodies. We do not<br />wish to go deeper at this time to look at percentages.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you. So just to repeat, the genetic experiment of<br />the Annunaki to create bodies ended up in a certain<br />percentage of individuals who just evolved on the earth and<br />another group that was occupied by star seeds and Wanderers<br />and higher dimensional being occupied those bodies to<br />experience this realm. Do I have that correctly?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Yes. It is possible that a star seed or a Wanderer or a<br />walk-in from another galaxy or civilization can walk into<br />these other bodies.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />Next question is from a man in Nigeria. One of his<br />assumptions is that there is a grand council with the Ra and<br />the Elohim, and the other is that things in the Bible there is<br />a lot of indication that a lot of beings from other dimensions<br />took on occasion, the position of God in different events and<br />some of them might have been the Ra and Elohim Groups but the<br />question has come up that Yahweh was of the Ra Group but then<br />took it upon himself to do his own thing. That being said I<br />will ask the question.<br /><br />In the grand council do negative forces sit there together<br />with the Ra and the Elohim. This question is most important to<br />me if we consider the Elohim intervention in the case of Job<br />in the old testament. He says this question is integral in our<br />unfolding educational process. So I will turn this over to<br />you.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Greetings to you in Africa. Thank you for your question. The<br />earth is very ancient and has been through different periods<br />of civilization and different periods of peoples that are in<br />different stages of growth. The Elohim and Ra have made a<br />collective consciousness, which is not really a council which<br />works with your group, and have come together for the specific<br />purpose of working with your group. The Council of Elohim is<br />one of the bodies that are working with other members of the<br />Elohim Group which help to guide the connections of the Elohim<br />with the earth population, and there are other governing bodies<br />of the Elohim that work within the governing of the Elohim<br />itself in their different functions. The Ra Group has a<br />council of it's own which helps to organize and govern the Ra<br />Group. Yahweh was a member of the Ra Group who was given the<br />station to help guide the Hebrew tribe. The connection of<br />Yahweh at the time as more fierce and warlike which was given<br />a bad orientation by both the nature of the obstacles and<br />challenges that people were undergoing and the growth of<br />Yahweh at that time, therefore in the different periods of<br />civilization of earth and a different openness of the people<br />to the Higher Sources means that in different periods of time,<br />the people who were interpreting the messages of the Elohim<br />were filtered through the consciousness of those in the earth<br />plane as well as the Ra Group.<br /><br />At this time earth is moving into a higher vibration which<br />allows for a more loving connection, and it is this that allows<br />us to come through bringing messages of love-light from the<br />highest order of the Elohim. We hope this had shed some light <br />on this question.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />It is interesting that we asked that question, because I just<br />checked my email and somebody sent a last minute question in<br />asking who was Yahweh and what was their agenda, so we <br />covered that.<br /><br /><br />Now we have a question from Nancy Jones in Florida. She took a<br />seminar on sound healing and she was told that tuning forks<br />could be used to change and balance your vibrations and<br />chakras and during the seminar the teacher made the statement<br />that a certain tone would releases all attachments to prior<br />incarnations when this tone is made over the solar plexus.<br />Now, she makes a lot of assumptions here and one is that that<br />is true that you can put a tuning fork over your solar plexus<br />and suddenly all your past incarnations are gone? Well that<br />does not make sense to me. Nancy goes on and says, why would<br />be want to release incarnations unless she means the karma<br />associated with those incarnations.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> Thank you for your question. That is a very interesting<br />question and the chakras have a resonance with the different<br />tones so moving a tone over a chakra can reinforce that chakra<br />and help it to be stronger so at time there is karma from past<br />lives and if they intervene with the movement of the chakra,<br />the spinning of the chakra as an individual holds onto<br />distortion from a past life, therefore if you hold the tuning<br />fork over that certain chakra and reinforce the vibration of<br />that chakra it can help to clear, however, the person is<br />holding that distortion within her or his field and as such<br />they are distorting the vibration of the chakra so if the<br />karma is very strong and traumatic it may be hard to clear,<br />however holding tones resonant with the individual chakras<br />can help support and help reinforce the person.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />Alright, I think our final question has to do with this period<br />we are in now, Daphne calls it a dip or a catalytic period<br />that started on August 18th and is supposed to continue for about<br />60 days and the question is, is there anything you would like<br />to share with us concerning this 60 days, and anything we might<br />expect to occur and anything we could use our positive<br />intentions to detour that could have a negative impact?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> One of the things to look at here are the individual<br />lives of each and every one of you and as these energies<br />permeate the earth sphere, one can move to stay grounded by<br />looking for or imagining the Hunab Ku and that energy coming<br />through the individual and into the center of the earth and to<br />keep grounded within this and to not be diverted and stay<br />alert and stay within your own center and the news has a<br />natural disruption, volatility in the stock market.<br />Abnormalities in the weather that can cause one to become<br />ungrounded or worried and scared so it is important to stay<br />alert and observe it and not move into the disruptions that<br />you may see around you. The area of weather, the different<br />sections of the world that are in flood zones and other<br />sections of much rain during this period can create a problem<br />and we send love light and we send a stabilization. The more<br />people who pray for stabilization, the easier it is, even the<br />weather to normalize. As all is intelligent and even factors<br />such as the weather are affected by consensus reality. The<br />more people that are grounded and centered and do not become<br />the subjects of media upset, the more stable life on earth<br />will be. That is our answer.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Thank you.<br /><br />I know these calls are helping people to stay centered and<br />stable and if you value that impact on yourself be sure to<br />take the opportunity to pass the book around,<br /><a href="http://www.creatorgodbook.com">www.creatorgodbook.com</a> and just share it. You never know when<br />something is going to resonate with someone.<br /><br /><br />Let's take a moment as people have asked to put the hurricane<br />in the light and asked if it could be diverted or modified so<br />that it doesn't cause devastation in the areas it is coming in<br />on. Let's take a moment and just hold the space for the<br />highest good of all that the impact of the hurricane be<br />modified.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We suggest you put it up on your Team Shift calls<br />starting tomorrow that the affects of the hurricane can be<br />modified.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Gjis:</strong> Can we also add that Texas be put in the light for rain.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> Yes.<br /><br />Then we have a specific request from Dee and her husband for<br />balance and health and let's include anyone on this line who<br />is working on a heath issue or asking for anything to ask for<br />the assistance from the higher realms. We will take just a<br />moment of silence.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ra'An:</strong> We suggest that anyone, whether they are having health<br />issues or not, maintain their body in an alkaline state because<br />it is very difficult to heal in an acidic state.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wynn:</strong> On that note we'll bring this call to a close. We<br />thank Terry for being so dedicated to this work and to all of<br />you for listening to our replays and coming into our Sunday<br />grid healing which are specifically dedicated to healing and<br />transformation of our planet and to those volunteering to get<br />everything working. I appreciate it very much.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Copyright 2002-2011 Wynn Free and Message a Day &nbsp;This<br />transcription may be freely shared, provided this copyright<br />notice and contact information is included and there is no<br />charge.
