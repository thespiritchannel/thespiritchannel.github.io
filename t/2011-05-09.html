(2011).&nbsp;&nbsp; My name<br />is Wynn Free with my co-host Terry Brown.&nbsp; We’re doing a<br />simulcast today and it’s a simulcast between BBS Radio and our<br />telephone conference line.&nbsp; We have a bunch of people on the<br />conference line.&nbsp; The advantage of being on the conference line<br />is sometimes you get a chance to ask questions; sometimes the<br />energy – can some of you feel the energy being stronger on the<br />conference line than over the internet? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Caller:</strong>&nbsp; I think you’re able to interact more and you have a<br />more personal one-on-one contact with each other. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; And, you can say “hello” to each other at the<br />beginning.&nbsp; If any of you want to come in on the conference line<br />you’re certainly welcome to.&nbsp; I’ll give you the phone number,<br />it is 712-432-1600 and the pin is 368522#. <br />&nbsp;<br />One of the things about the conference line is we always say<br />“hello” to everybody at the beginning of the line.&nbsp; Kind of<br />like you’re more connected,&nbsp; because there’s “hello”, but<br />what amazes me is the emails I get from people who I don’t<br />know, whom I never knew existed who have been listening to our<br />calls and on the conference line;&nbsp; you know, there’s people<br />that always don’t say “hello”.&nbsp; They start listening for a<br />few months and they have this huge epiphany reaction, something<br />shifts for them dramatically.&nbsp; You don’t have to be on the line<br />to get the energies, but for many people grounding it in a<br />“Hello, how are you?&nbsp; I know Wynn, Wynn knows me…” helps to<br />make or solidify the connection. <br />&nbsp;<br />Now that I’ve said all that, we had a couple of people check<br />in.&nbsp; Does anyone want to say “hello” and their city? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Chris:&nbsp;</strong> It’s Chris in Memphis . <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Chris? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Chris:</strong>&nbsp; Hey. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Now Chris is one of those guys that had this great<br />transformation on our line.&nbsp; He’s been unemployed all his life,<br />and then when he started coming on the line he got a job. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Chris:&nbsp;</strong> Well, we’ll have to discuss that in private! <br />&nbsp;<br />*laughing* <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; I’m sure as heck not going to tell you who I am. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Gjis:</strong>&nbsp; Welcome to the call Michael. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong> Not after that one, gee! <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; That’s Michael. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp; Speaking… greetings. <br />&nbsp;<br />Raleigh:&nbsp; Hi - Raleigh and Dave from Fallbrook. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Hi Raleigh and Dave.&nbsp; Raleigh, this guy Dave is with you<br />on all your calls.&nbsp; Does that mean you’re an item? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Raleigh:</strong>&nbsp; Correct.&nbsp; He’s living with me now. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; That’s wonderful! <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Raleigh:&nbsp;</strong> Yes, thank you. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Dave, you are a lucky man. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Dave:</strong>&nbsp; Definitely, thank you. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Anyone else want to say “hello”, their name and their<br />city? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Cinda:</strong>&nbsp; This is Cinda from Phoenix . <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Hi Cinda. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Cinda:&nbsp;</strong> Hi Wynn. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; How’s the weather in Phoenix ? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Cinda:&nbsp;</strong> Really gorgeous today. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; I won’t announce as a celebrity; we only do that<br />one time!&nbsp; Alright - anyone else want to say “hello”?&nbsp; Hey,<br />Michael I thought you weren’t going to be on the call today. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Michael</strong>:&nbsp; Well I wasn’t going to be on for very long.&nbsp; I’ve<br />got to leave shortly, but I thought I’d get on the line and see<br />how it went for as long as I could stay on. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Good, okay.&nbsp; I want you guys that are listening to know<br />that most of us have never met; although I did meet Raleigh and I<br />did meet Michael.&nbsp; Raleigh came to one of our shows in Los<br />Angeles .&nbsp; The amazing thing about this line is the people that<br />keep coming on get to be really friendly with each other.&nbsp; It<br />kind of becomes a community without a physical place, a telephone<br />community, right? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Caller(s):</strong>&nbsp; Um hum. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Sometimes, we get closer than the people that are in our<br />physical community because there’s an energy present here that<br />lifts the vibration so people – how do I say this? – will<br />feel like this is a group that understands which – maybe it is;<br />at least someone here understands.&nbsp; The understanding comes from<br />– you see, the crazy thing is – the understanding comes from<br />energies in other dimensions.&nbsp; So, it’s a small group on the<br />phone, but a big group in the ethers. <br />&nbsp;<br />Anyone else want to say ‘hello,’ their name and their city? <br />It’s natural that we’ll have a number of people checking in<br />tonight that don’t want to say “Hello” that never showed up<br />before, because the topic is – Terry&nbsp; doesn’t even know, I<br />don’t think.&nbsp; Maybe she does, because she heard me talking to<br />Don.&nbsp; The topic is “Sex”. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; (Cat meows).&nbsp; Do I hear Zeke? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Cinda:&nbsp;</strong> No, that wasn’t Zeke. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> That wasn’t Zeke? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Cinda:</strong>&nbsp; Nope, that must have been someone else’s cat, nope. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> We also have a community of cats on the line that say<br />“hello” to each other.&nbsp; In any case, I’m going to mute<br />everybody and we’ll get started because this is a really<br />interesting topic.&nbsp; The topic tonight, it’s a good thing Terry<br />is not answering this because she would be so shy she would run<br />away.&nbsp; The topic – do you know what the topic is Terry? <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> I heard you say earlier. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I would suspect when we bring in our sources and ask these<br />questions, we’re going to get kind of a preponderance of Ra<br />group energy since the Elohim, by and large, don’t have the<br />experience of this - except vicariously.&nbsp; We’re going to find<br />out if they’re really vicarious.&nbsp; Are we ever alone, or is<br />someone watching? <br />&nbsp;<br />I don’t think these topics have ever been discussed in a public<br />forum, because the topic is “Sex and Orgasms”.&nbsp; The last time<br />we tried to have a conversation with the Elohim on this topic,<br />which we did, the question, or the topic was “How did Sex get<br />started?” and we had a long conversation about how they got two<br />amoebas together exchanging energies.&nbsp; That was the beginning of<br />sex in the physical universe.&nbsp; So, we never got to humans.&nbsp; Today<br />we’re going to focus on humans. <br />&nbsp;<br />That is a very serious topic; it’s something that all of us<br />have to deal with; most of us, I would say most of us have to<br />deal with it.&nbsp; Even if were not dealing with it, on some level we<br />have the urges and if we … maybe we’re suppressing them. <br />What does it mean?&nbsp; How does that interrelate to the big picture,<br />because it is part of the big picture.&nbsp; How do we balance that<br />part of our human experience? <br />&nbsp;<br />We’re going to call in the light – calling in the light is<br />another way of invoking the Law of One, invoking a group energy. <br />Many people feel the energy on the call, and if you want to feel<br />the energy you can shut your eyes, take your shoes off, be in a<br />quiet place.&nbsp; Don’t have the television on in the background,<br />and you may notice a tingling, some people get goose bumps, some<br />people feel sensations on the top of their head, some people get<br />very relaxed and some people fall asleep, like Chris.&nbsp; Oh good,<br />he’s muted.&nbsp; But, even falling asleep is good, because<br />sometimes this is what I think can happen when you fall asleep on<br />this line:&nbsp; It allows interdimensional energies to work with you<br />and help lift karmic patterns, help balance energies that would<br />be harder to balance if you were awake.&nbsp; Some of us have to do<br />that. <br />&nbsp;<br />Even I do that sometimes; there’s times when I do these calls<br />(I never said this before), but I find myself kind of like half<br />asleep in between questions and then waking up, “Oops!&nbsp; Time<br />for the next question.”&nbsp; It’s amazing how part of my<br />consciousness is tracking the call, and part of it is spacing<br />out.&nbsp; I think the reason is that… it’s a good thing Terry<br />doesn’t do that.&nbsp; We’d really be in trouble; she does it<br />after the calls, she sleeps for a long time oftentimes.&nbsp; Because<br />we create a group energy, we’re processing the group energy. <br />Sometimes I’m really on top of processing it and sometimes<br />I’m not.&nbsp; Sometimes if there are a lot of new people it’s an<br />exceptional exercise in processing the energy.&nbsp; For the last<br />while – I have to give thanks to the people that keep coming<br />into the calls, because they are actually helping to hold the<br />space for processing, which means we can have a lot of new people<br />on these calls, and the energy will sustain. <br />&nbsp;<br />Father Mother God, we ask for the presence of the light to<br />surround and protect each person on this call and each person who<br />listens to the replays; and, (we ask that) any negativity be<br />taken to the higher realms of light and transmuted for the<br />highest good of all concerned.&nbsp; We see ourselves in the flow of<br />energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the<br />galaxies, through the center of our galaxy, through the planetary<br />fields, through the sun, through the outer energy fields of the<br />earth, through our bodies and into the earth.&nbsp; Right now, we<br />invoke - all of those who would free-willingly choose - a group<br />energy connection, a blending of energies in other dimensions of<br />us.&nbsp; We invite – I should say, while maintaining the sovereign<br />integrity of our souls.&nbsp; And, we invite those sources who are<br />positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of One, to join<br />with us as we create a protected space that only the positive has<br />access to and anything not of that nature must leave now. <br />&nbsp;<br />Some of you noticed that shift of energy when I invited them to<br />join us.&nbsp; We are now a huge energy conglomerate – I don’t<br />know if ‘conglomerate’ is the right word – a huge blended<br />energy of all of us, as many of them as they would contribute to<br />work with us, and all of you who are listening on the replay<br />lines, who, even though you’re not here on this call, you’re<br />here on the projected futures of this call.&nbsp; Your energies are<br />still here.&nbsp; Do we have a source ready to answer our questions?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; We greet you in the love light of the One<br />Infinite Creator.&nbsp; We had technical difficulties and we are on<br />the conference line.&nbsp; If it’s all ‘a go’, we can continue.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Okay.&nbsp; Hopefully I’m still connected to BBS Radio, and<br />we’re on the air.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We greet you in the love light of the One Infinite<br />Creator.&nbsp; It is our delight and joy to join you this evening on<br />“The Wynn Show.”&nbsp; We are available to answer any of your<br />questions.&nbsp; Do you have questions?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Well, yeah – the topic tonight is “The Mystery of the<br />Orgasm”, which I think was a book by Wilhelm Reich years ago. <br />We started out a number of shows ago talking about how the<br />Elohim, the first instance of sex, when I think there were moving<br />two amoebas next to each other and managed to get them to<br />exchange energy.&nbsp; Can we have, like, a quick look at how we went<br />from amoebas exchanging energies to all the rituals we have today<br />regarding sexual interchange?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We, in our energy forms, worked with the developing<br />small forms, and over millions of years were able to see how they<br />would develop; and, we would make energy models of what would be<br />a delightful form of human that would be able to survive on the<br />planets.&nbsp; This form was much the same from planet to planet. <br />Then the question “How to procreate the race?” came up, and<br />there were complex models made of how chemical reactions could<br />lead to procreation, and how to transform the chemical reactions<br />into one of the complex forms.&nbsp; There were many years of trial<br />and error and many false starts, and when we would get a model<br />that worked fairly well, and then we’d find a few false starts<br />that ended up badly and the race, therefore, would not work. <br />Then we went back to the drawing board.&nbsp; The procreation of the<br />races was worked out in theory before it was put into effect.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Were Elohim souls coming down and occupying those bodies,<br />those original bodies, at some point?&nbsp; I know that according to<br />history and according to some of our previous conversations there<br />was a group – they’re sometimes called “Fallen Elohim”, I<br />don’t know if that’s the right term – but, the Annunaki<br />that engineered humans, but they were already in bodies, but,<br />they must have had the advanced bodies.&nbsp; So, as you were<br />engineering bodies, were the souls new souls, or was the Elohim<br />occupying them?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We would send souls down from our group to bravely<br />experiment and to occupy a body and then come back and report<br />what the feelings and sensations were, and see if the body could<br />operate independently, and we went - we would leave and see how<br />the race would fare.&nbsp; It fared better when there was an Elohim<br />soul that occupied the body than when it was on remote.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Were the Elohim souls that occupied these first bodies<br />able to maintain communication with the celestial Elohim very<br />clearly, at that time?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes, they were as they were not duplicating and messed<br />up by the lower dimensions.&nbsp; They were pure; and as such had<br />their mission to go occupy the body, check it out, and see if it<br />was viable from the hands-on viewpoint, and then move back into<br />the higher realms to their unit of design and to report.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Now, eventually did they, they didn’t come back from the<br />bodies.&nbsp; In Edgar Cayce it was said that was due to sex; that<br />they got sexually involved with some of the local creatures.&nbsp; Was<br />it sex with the local creatures that caused the Elohim souls, the<br />pure Elohim souls, to get stuck in this realm and forget, take on<br />the veil of forgetfulness?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An</strong>:&nbsp; The ones checking out the functionality of the beings,<br />the human beings, had strict orders that they were to follow. <br />Some of them got addicted to sex and did not want to return, and<br />eventually they would get disconnected from the (higher) realm.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Was it sex with each other they were getting addicted<br />with, or sex with the lower creatures in the realm?&nbsp; Was it sex<br />with the lower creatures in the realm or sex with the other<br />Elohim beings in the realm that caused them to get disconnected?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; It was sex with the humans in the human realms that<br />causes them to get disconnected.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Somewhere in the Bible it says, “The sons of God mated<br />with daughters of man”; does that relate to that situation?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> It isn’t one time of having sex that is the problem;<br />it is many times of having sex.&nbsp; And if it is done wisely, it<br />will not trap one in the third dimensional realm.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Okay.&nbsp; Now we here are all humans and we’re all dealing<br />with our sexualities – the lack of it, too much of it,<br />obsession with it.&nbsp; Obviously, every human is unique and that<br />they’re going to have a unique way of dealing with their<br />sexuality.&nbsp; But, in general, there’s a number – some people<br />who are spiritual talk about that it’s good not to have sex. <br />What’s the word for that?&nbsp; I forget.&nbsp; To be celibate – and<br />that when you’re celibate you have a better connection with<br />spirituality and higher forces.&nbsp; On the other hand, there are<br />people that – and we’ve even had this come up in our<br />channelings – that if one doesn’t have sex they could lose<br />their ability to ground in the lower chakras.&nbsp; So could you<br />comment about that?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> When one does not hang on to a situation and moves<br />through it and stays in the now, then one can use sex as a tool<br />for growth and connection and procreation.&nbsp; It can be a marvelous<br />tool.&nbsp; The dangers are that one would get addicted to the<br />situation and become unfacile or inflexible about moving in and<br />out of situations.&nbsp; When they would move from one lifetime to the<br />next, they may be hanging on to some fantasy.&nbsp; When sex is joined<br />with distorted experiences, this can catapult one out of the<br />upper realms and keep them in the lower realms and provides the<br />path to be lost, for them to lose their way.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I would imagine that there would be two factors that would<br />be potentials for causing one to lose their way.&nbsp; One is to have<br />sex without the heart chakra open, without the upper chakras<br />open, and so the experience is focused in just the lower chakras,<br />in which case it pulls people into the lower chakras and<br />disconnects them from the higher chakras.&nbsp; Is that true?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That is correct.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Now how about if someone is opening up their higher<br />chakras, then it becomes a union of energy between two people<br />that is very profound and transformative?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; It can be a sacred experience of joining.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Now how about if one is just doing it by self-service? <br />What are the implications of that?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Well, this can relax the body and can take the tension<br />off and so, it could be of benefit.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> And, when people are having let’s say, ‘good sex’,<br />sex where their higher chakras are open (or) opening, do<br />interdimensional sources participate?&nbsp; Or, I’ve understood that<br />negative entities can actually enter into someone’s space when<br />their energies are open.&nbsp; Could we have a little more<br />understanding of that?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> When an individual has a new partner, they need to take<br />care in choosing their partner wisely, as this is a really open<br />giving and taking.&nbsp; If they would choose perhaps the wrong<br />partner, there could be a subtle action wherein the entities of<br />one person can move over the second person and attempt to fasten<br />down the relationship to orient them (in an attempt to) make the<br />second person love them.&nbsp; So entities could enter in that way. <br />So, if the person is totally cognizant and aware and open to<br />someone that is of similar character, then the individual can<br />still recognize if another negative entity would come in. <br />&nbsp;<br />At times, an entity may come into the union to attempt to become<br />a part of a body of a baby, and then this could be a good thing<br />if the union was seeking to procreate and if the entity coming in<br />was pure; which, it should be if the two individuals having the<br />procreation sex are pure.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Depending on the quality of the procreation - will that<br />make a difference on the quality of the entity, the baby, that<br />can come in?&nbsp; In other words, if two people are having a kind of,<br />what we’ll call ‘low-level sex’ and they have a baby, will<br />they tend to get a baby of lower realm as opposed to people who<br />are having high-level sex?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; The quality of the sexual encounter and the<br />quality of the people would attract a similar quality of child<br />who was attempting to come into the baby and a child, wherein<br />that child could experience the type of growth that the baby<br />needed.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Many religious groups are proponents,<br />spiritual/religious, are proponents of celibacy.&nbsp; Giving up sex,<br />and joining a monastery and becoming a nun or a sister or a monk<br />– is there a benefit in doing that, or is that just something<br />that has to happen in order to create those kinds of communities<br />of people?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> There can be a benefit; it depends upon the training<br />and the structure.&nbsp; If the training is towards the development of<br />the higher chakras and towards the development of the connection<br />of the individual, the areas of crown chakra connecting with the<br />higher forces - it can be a benefit to the individual, as the<br />energy that would normally go into the foundational chakra and<br />into the home and family and the desires for procreation would<br />end in the higher chakras and allow them to do that more. <br />&nbsp;<br />There are many subjects, however it’s an individual (thing, a<br />person’s) more normal bent.&nbsp; Part of the challenge to a group<br />of the priesthood is that yearning after sexual experience.&nbsp; This<br />can be damaging to both him and to people that he comes in<br />contact with, particularly if he is seeking in secretive ways to<br />fulfill his yearning.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> This is what happened to some of the priests in the<br />Catholic Church over the past few years that came to light.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> So, in fact, those people were denying their sexuality,<br />but they really were not able to deny it; it was still latent as<br />an obsession to be expressed. <br />&nbsp;<br />There are some things that connect with sexuality that many<br />people connect with it.&nbsp; One of the things is possession;<br />possession of another being.&nbsp; On the other hand, the dolphins as<br />I understand have no possessiveness.&nbsp; They travel in pods and<br />that they openly have sexual connection with each other and they<br />all know about what everyone is doing.&nbsp; And, dolphins are very<br />evolved, we hear.&nbsp; So could you explain the ramifications of<br />possessiveness and that kind of open interaction that dolphins<br />have?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; The whole grouping and social context of the dolphins<br />is different than that of humans, as they work in a pod and the<br />children can be raised by all of the adults.&nbsp; With a human the<br />grouping is to be in families and pairs, and to raise the<br />children within that family group; this fosters possessiveness. <br />The dolphins have a greater understanding of the love between the<br />‘All That Is’ and their individual self, and they are not as<br />isolated in their connections as the human body. <br />&nbsp;<br />The dolphins have the ability to get information from their<br />surroundings, from the centers of their brain, to communicate<br />with each other in a broader way, and to move interdimensionally.<br />&nbsp;The humans are more isolated in that respect and it makes it<br />harder to share, and there is a greater distillation’ of desire<br />within the human psyche, which brings a person’s attention in<br />closer.&nbsp; And, the dolphin’s attention is more defuse and they<br />have more give-and-take with the outside of their surroundings. <br />&nbsp;<br />The humans, due to the construction of the body, are more<br />localized and as such their relationships are more comfortable to<br />them in the majority of cases when they are so localized with a<br />husband and a wife and a family.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; I think that a really good question here would<br />be two questions.&nbsp; It’s like “How do we go from where we are<br />to where we want to be?”&nbsp; There are two circumstances.&nbsp; One is:<br />&nbsp;someone is in a relationship; they’re committed to the<br />relationship.&nbsp; Maybe they even have children, but they’ve lost<br />the intimacy, they’ve lost the exchange.&nbsp; Their sexuality is<br />not balancing them in the way perhaps it did when they were first<br />starting.&nbsp; How does a couple bring back those feelings of that<br />connection when they’ve lost it and they’re still committed<br />to each other?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; This would be a question for the Ra group, and give us<br />a moment. <br />&nbsp;<br />Much as you have a refresh button on the computer, then one can<br />reset and can let go of all the extraneous things that have<br />happened that may clog up the relationship - memories that one<br />reacted negatively in what happened; and they can seek to let<br />that go and to reset.&nbsp; And, if both partners can reset, and work<br />with each other to attempt to get rid of the baggage and luggage<br />that they are carrying and the memories that were hard, and let<br />them go – and then do something nice for each other.&nbsp; Give each<br />other some flowers, or treat them to a play, something that they<br />like.&nbsp; If you have the cooperation of both partners, then you can<br />make some progress in this way.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; One of the things that sometimes happens in a<br />really deteriorating relationship, is the people – one partner<br />- wants to create a successful intimacy and the other doesn’t,<br />but they’re possessive and they won’t let that person see<br />anyone else.&nbsp; How does someone deal with this?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Give us a moment.&nbsp; One can experiment with the<br />different means or methods available to pamper oneself and to<br />treat oneself very, very good; and, to talk with the partner and<br />ask/seek to understand the partner’s desired habits, and what<br />the thoughts are within the pattern of the person that the person<br />does not want to move forward in the sexual experience at this<br />same frequency. Oftentimes, when one can talk about it, one can<br />learn more about what the partner is desiring. <br />&nbsp;<br />Also, a partner may have things going on that they don’t wish<br />to move into a sexual experience right then, and maybe it is just<br />that they are in the middle of something they wish to finish; or,<br />maybe it is something that they are wired at the time and they<br />can relax later. Maybe a turn-down is just a temporary thing;<br />maybe the person can be wooed with flowers and sweet talk to get<br />them into the mood and beyond that, or maybe one can massage the<br />partner and bring the partner into a mood that they would like to<br />move into a sexual encounter.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> One of the things I’ve noticed is that sometimes when<br />people are not having sexual expression, they tend to get<br />withdrawn and they don’t seem attractive, and then it’s hard<br />for them to make the connection to get things started. <br />&nbsp;<br />That could be for a person that’s alone, that’s living alone<br />– they tend to have an aura of aloneness, and ‘Keep Away’. <br />Underneath, they don’t really feel that way, but it’s in<br />their space.&nbsp; How can a person move through that so that they<br />don’t put that energy out so that they can attract the<br />experience that they want?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> They can take on an activity that brings them out of<br />it, to remember back on what activities enlivened them and make<br />them laugh, telling jokes to them and telling jokes to oneself;<br />reading jokes, until they can break that mood.&nbsp; And, putting<br />themselves in an environment where they break that mood; getting<br />a massage from a masseuse, something that can help with their<br />body reactions.&nbsp; Taking a bath in a Jacuzzi; something to move<br />them, move their energy, and move their energy out so they can<br />begin to project outward.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; I would think that one of the topics we talk<br />about very often is graduation of this realm, and that it’s<br />important for a person to get their energies open and loose and<br />loving, and if they’ve avoided dealing with their sexuality it<br />could impact their ability to express love and keep an open heart<br />in general.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn</strong>:&nbsp; Is that true?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, a really good connection could help propel<br />someone towards that 51% heart opening for graduation.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.&nbsp; There are other things one can do to open the<br />heart; however, to be in a situation with other people with<br />give-and-take, where they can feel love; to have a close animal<br />that they can have a good friendship with - these all can also<br />help.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> So if a person does not have a good intimate relationship,<br />they can find a way to get their heart open.&nbsp; The important thing<br />is to move from that place where they feel closed in and<br />oppressed into some kind of activity where their energy flows<br />with other people.&nbsp; That’s like a first step.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes, that is.&nbsp; Also, when an individual is depressed<br />there can also be factors that they see at the time, (like) a<br />specific day making their depression deeper – and see what<br />makes their depression lighter, and see if there are any specific<br />issues in their life that are weighing down on them.&nbsp; Like, an<br />individual in one’s surroundings that is abusive that the<br />circumstances could be changed.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; When people are having really loving beautiful sex, do you<br />guys ever join with the energies?&nbsp; When people are having<br />beautiful, loving sex, do you guys ever feel the energies of that<br />in your realm?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Yes, we can.&nbsp; Not only we, but other people also can. <br />Individuals who are discarnate that may be looking for a body<br />also can.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> So there’s not a lot of privacy?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Not in the sense that you would term ‘privacy’.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Right.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I think I’ve covered the topics that I<br />had planned; maybe if anyone out there wants to ask a question,<br />only question(s) on this topic, is that okay with you if we let a<br />couple of questions come through?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Alright.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Raleigh:</strong>&nbsp; Hi, this Raleigh and I would like to know if a couple<br />should be married, if that makes a difference, in having sex<br />relationships how loving or powerful it is.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> That’s a very good question.&nbsp; Of course we know intimacy<br />with married couples that have terrible sexual relationships and<br />some that have great.&nbsp; Could our sources explain the value of a<br />marriage commitment in relationship to sex?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> Sometimes the people wait and have sex after they are<br />married.&nbsp; It is an extra added commitment to the marriage and it<br />sets the sexual experience aside as more sacred, and it can be a<br />greater bond. <br />&nbsp;<br />With an individual who has sex before marriage then it can be<br />also a great experience that can lead into commitment.&nbsp; It<br />depends upon the attitude and the upbringing and on the diligence<br />and intention of the two people to create a good relationship.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Raleigh:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I would like to ask the question:&nbsp; I would assume, but it<br />would like to hear you say it, that the answers that we’re<br />giving here are true for both heterosexual and same-sex sexual<br />interchanges.&nbsp; Could we say that’s true?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> That is correct.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for your question, Raleigh .&nbsp; Anyone<br />else have a question?&nbsp; -silence-<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Raleigh:&nbsp;</strong> I have another question if that’s okay. <br />&nbsp;<br />Do they have any suggestions on how to start a sexual act?&nbsp; Is<br />there something that would make it more sacred?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An</strong>:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Before starting a sexual act one can<br />communicate with the partner; one can do it slowly so that the<br />body is prepared, as if things move too fast then it can, the<br />body can, and its preparation can lag behind then it won’t be<br />as great an experience.&nbsp; The body responds and one needs to keep<br />pace with how the body is responding and observe one’s partner<br />to make sure that the sex is in synch.&nbsp; One is not rushing ahead<br />or creating pain for the other. <br />&nbsp;<br />Before the act, when one has something to eat or to drink it can<br />help prepare the body for sex, as it gets the fluids in the body<br />flowing; although do not eat too much.&nbsp; Then it would make the<br />people drowsy, but something stimulating before the sexual act to<br />set the scene for the act.&nbsp; This will also help the body move<br />into preparedness for the act, like beautiful music that they<br />both like, or say – wine that they both like.&nbsp; (Or) some drink<br />that they both like; and clean sheets and a clean, organized<br />space would all help.&nbsp; Those are our comments.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Raleigh:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you. <br />&nbsp;<br />I think we’ll close with one final question; we’re going a<br />little over because there was space on BBS to do that.&nbsp; That is: <br />Could you explain a little bit about the differences in natures<br />of men and women so that the men on the line could help<br />understand women better, and the women might understand men<br />better?<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> One of them is for the women that the men understand<br />the woman’s body will get ready and begin to secrete a<br />substance that can help make the body more ready and help with<br />the penetration of the man.&nbsp; If the woman is not made ready, then<br />the joy, the sense of joy, will be lessened.&nbsp; It can create pain<br />and antagonism following by the woman.&nbsp; If the man can learn to<br />sense the tides and rhythms of the female body, the response -<br />see how it is responding, then they will be able to move into<br />satisfaction of the partner and then the partner will naturally<br />unfold beauty for the man. <br />&nbsp;<br />For the woman that is working to have sex, moving to have sex<br />with the man, then there are sensitive areas that she can work<br />with and she can find these areas by manipulation and seeing what<br />arouses the man more and what will bring the man to the sexual<br />orgasm, as sometimes the stroking of the balls can help elicit<br />the orgasm. <br />&nbsp;<br />The same with the man, as he can explore and see which areas are<br />very sensitive and responsive in the woman, and an area that may<br />be responsive later may not be responsive at the start if one is<br />moving too fast.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; We’ll bring this show to a close<br />– I thank everyone, I thank Terry so much for being here and<br />being available to answer these questions; and, all of you for<br />holding the energy and all of you on the replay lines. <br />&nbsp;<br />We’ll see you again Wednesday. When you submit questions: <br /><strong>questions@messageaday.net</strong>, and we’ll be asking them on our<br />Wednesday call.&nbsp; We’ll see you all next time!&nbsp; Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
