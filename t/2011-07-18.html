font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Host :&nbsp; Wynn Free</span><br /><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Channeled and Edited by Terry Brown</span><br /><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Transcribed by Connie O'Brien</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; Good afternoon, good evening, good morning wherever you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are and whenever you are listening or reading a transcript. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Welcome.&nbsp; It is July 18th, 2011, and I’m pleased to introduce</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Wynn Free for the Monday night BBS conference call/radio show. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It’s a simulcast; he is out retrieving people on the conference</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">line who call in, and the others are on BBS Radio.&nbsp; So welcome,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">wherever you are. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">This is Terry Brown, I’m the co-host of the show.&nbsp; I never know</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what he is going to have for a topic.&nbsp; If I knew, I might agonize</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">over it so it’s better to just have it happen and there it is. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’m often channeling on this show, and sometimes we have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">guests.&nbsp; Wynn and I (Terry Brown) are in Sedona, Arizona.&nbsp; We</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">just had a huge thunder-lightening storm which has died down now.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;But, it’s really nice to experience the rain.&nbsp; It was dry</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">earlier in the season, and now it’s raining every few days.&nbsp; We</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have a little place with some fruit trees and they are doing well</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and we’re hoping to grow some food over here.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">My background is:&nbsp; I have a degree in Physics.&nbsp; I set up the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">library for Tektronixs, which was a large electronics firm in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Beaverton, Oregon.&nbsp; I went to California and became a legal</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">secretary and I was a legal secretary for a lot of years.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sounds like Wynn is on the line with his conference call people. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Wynn, are you there?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; No. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> (Laughter)</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I like to do those things to see how Terry handles it. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gijs:</strong>&nbsp; I’d like to save her! </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you feel saved, Terry?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I almost responded!&nbsp; But, you always pull these</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">jokes and tricks.&nbsp; When I was a legal secretary he used to call</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">up with his Arabian accent and complain about the service he was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">getting in a legal case.&nbsp; Sometimes he caught me.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; (Speaking in Arabian accent) You’re not supposed to tell</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">them about that.&nbsp; “I’m going to sue your office!&nbsp; We have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">lots of oil money.”&nbsp; She never knew if it was real or if it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">wasn’t, so she would go along with it just in case.&nbsp; (Laughter)</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">This is Monday July 18th (2011) and my name is Wynn Free.&nbsp; I’m</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in Sedona and my co-host is Terry Brown.&nbsp; We still don’t have a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">very good name for this show.&nbsp; It’s called the Wynn Free</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">conference call/simulcast.&nbsp; That doesn’t say very much.&nbsp; One of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the reasons the things I do don’t say very much is because I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have a little bit of anticipation of trying to name things close</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to what really happens.&nbsp; What do we have?&nbsp; Message a Day, The</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Spirit Channel, The Wynn Channel.&nbsp; What really happens on this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">call, the Wynn Free Conference Call? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Those of you who have been checking in regularly, who have been</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">listening regularly, know that this is a very unusual call.&nbsp; Many</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of the things we do are unusual because I’ve never seen</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">anything like what I’m doing happen in this realm; I’ve been</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">around a long time.&nbsp; I’ve been to many spiritual groups and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’ve been to all kinds of stuff.&nbsp; I think why we don’t say</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what it is, is because you’re not supposed to believe what it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is.&nbsp; You’re supposed to check it out and prove it to yourself. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">If I said it was ‘this’ and you believed (it was) this, then</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we lose an opportunity to actually connect and you become a blind</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">follower, or somebody who has let go of their own – let go of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what, Terry?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> Let go of their own judgment, maybe?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Let go - of their own ‘volition’.&nbsp; Every one is a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">totally unique, independent part of creation.&nbsp; Each of us has the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">challenge to discover how to live that.&nbsp; In this realm most</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people don’t take on that challenge.&nbsp; They have been trained</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this way – you have to break out of this way:&nbsp; someone is going</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to take care of me.&nbsp; My mother and father took care of me, the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">government will take of me.&nbsp; Somebody is always going to be there</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">for me.&nbsp; Some of us are lucky enough to have that true for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">certain periods of our life and that’s a wonderful experience</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">when someone is there for you; when someone takes care of you,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">when someone pays the bills when you can’t.&nbsp; It’s a wonderful</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">experience and I would wish everyone to have people in their life</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">like that.&nbsp; Or, maybe you’re like that for other people and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that’s a beautiful experience. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">But, many more people are getting their backs up against the wall</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">these days and it’s happening financially.&nbsp; It’s one of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Achilles’ heels of this transformation.&nbsp; If you’re going to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">be part of the transformation, you have to stay alive.&nbsp; If you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have things you still need to do and change and grow, you have to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">do it.&nbsp; You have to figure out what you need to do to make the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">shift.&nbsp; There is a lot to be talked about on that; we’re going</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to have a talk with our sources, but I just want to talk about it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">from my human level on this thing. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">As many of you know, we’ve been doing ‘Message a Day’ for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">probably two years now.&nbsp; We have three conference calls a week;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we have ‘Message a Day’ a daily e-mailing.&nbsp; We have the Wynn</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Channel – some of you know what that is –</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><a href="http://www.thewynnchannel.messageaday.net">www.thewynnchannel.messageaday.net</a>.&nbsp; We have the Spirit Channel</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">where you’re getting transcripts when they’re done, where</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’re getting audios when they are done.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’m now looking at ‘Message a Day’ and all this other stuff</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">as a beta-test.&nbsp; (A Beta-test is) what computer companies always</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">call them – they come out with a new program and they don’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">know if it’s going to work.&nbsp; They just tell everybody, “Get</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">our program; tell us what is wrong with it.”&nbsp; Then they fix it,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">then they charge for it.&nbsp; In terms of money survival, we’re not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">doing ourselves or you a favor by making everything free, because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">part of oneness is connection, and we have to keep roofs over our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">heads, we have to pay internet bills.&nbsp; I’m not going to turn</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">around and tell everybody at ‘Message a Day’:&nbsp; “You’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going to have to spend money.”&nbsp; I may at some point, but not at</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this point.&nbsp; I know how this works now, I know how people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">benefit, you know how people benefit.&nbsp; We’re doing some new</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">recruiting of people – I shouldn’t use the word</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“recruit”.&nbsp; We’re exposing our materials to people and new</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people are coming in using the Creator God video</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">(www.creatorgodbook.com); look at the video and I’m giving the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">book away for free, The Creator Gods of the Physical Universe</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">want to Talk to You. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It’s a really good idea to give it away for free because you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can’t explain what this is very easily and expect people to get</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it.&nbsp; You can tell people I have a book on the best-selling</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">charts, metaphysical; he’s giving away his next book for free. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">For whatever reason, people will respond to that.&nbsp; Try to tell</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">them, “Call your friends up”; some of you have done this,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’ve heard the story.&nbsp; Call your friends up and say, “I have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this guy who is talking to the Elohim and that’s the word for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">God in the Old Testament and he wrote a book and he wants to give</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it to you.”&nbsp; No one will read it; maybe somebody will.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">dumb way the world works, without judging it, you take it into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">consideration.&nbsp; (You) say “This guy is a best-selling author;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">he has thousands of people responding to what he’s doing.&nbsp; Look</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">at all the things people are saying about him!”&nbsp; Then, people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">say, “Let me check it out.”&nbsp; Don’t go around telling people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the guy’s talking to the source that created the Universe;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that’s the title of the book.&nbsp; We don’t have to say it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because it’s on the book.&nbsp; Let people figure it out because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it’s on the book. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">When you come from a high spiritual place, even when your life is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">screwed up you still came from there or you wouldn’t be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">listening.&nbsp; Other people usually run the other direction.&nbsp; But,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">when you come from a high spiritual place in this realm, you have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a great deal of expectation and standards.&nbsp; Oftentimes, those</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">expectations and standards totally block you, because you can’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">flow with the negative.&nbsp; (For example) I could say “I’m not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going to do this or that, I’m going to make it be the way I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">want it.”&nbsp; But, if I do it the way I want it and nobody pays</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">attention, then what good is it? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I heard somebody wise say something a long time and I never</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">forgot it.&nbsp; They said “If you really want to make a difference</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in somebody’s life, you just come in for a really short thing</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and you withdraw and you let it go.”&nbsp; Don’t think about it;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">don’t call them every day.&nbsp; Let it go and then come back to it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a week later and come in for a short period.&nbsp; We’ve all had</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">(the) experience where we wanted to make a difference and we went</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">into something and felt like we really got stuck.&nbsp; We say, “Now</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’m picking up all their negativity and I have to run away.” </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Now I’m talking about, people that you want to influence that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have really big negative patterns.&nbsp; As you probably all have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">learned, you can’t change someone else’s patterns no matter</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">how much you care about them.&nbsp; Somehow it has to come from them. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">When somebody is going through really big negative patterns and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you get attached to changing them, you’re going to get</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">depressed.&nbsp; You’re going to get worried; you’re going to get</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">concerned.&nbsp; That’s going to put you into a negative spin</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">downward. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The way you do it is when you’re really uplifted, do something</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">really nice for that person.&nbsp; Buy them a present; take them to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">lunch.&nbsp; Don’t just call them up and say, “Dump on me”</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because it doesn’t work.&nbsp; They will dump on you and they may</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">take your energy.&nbsp; After you hang up, you’re going to feel</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">really not so good; you’re going to feel depleted because they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">took their energy.&nbsp; Do something for them that’s unexpected,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">one of those random acts of kindness.&nbsp; I read something recently</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that I thought was very wise.&nbsp; They talked about kindness is love</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">expressed.&nbsp; It’s not love that changes the world; it’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">kindness.&nbsp; Can you think of areas in your life where you can be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">kind?&nbsp; One of the things about someone who is going through</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">really heavy stuff is: if you just meet them as an equal and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they’re going through that stuff they’re going to pull you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">into it.&nbsp; I don’t mean to meet them as a superior.&nbsp; I mean to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">meet them where you put so much positive energy into it: </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“Let’s go to lunch; I’m buying lunch today.&nbsp; I thought you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">might need that.”&nbsp; Make them feel really good; then, withdraw</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">for a while, so that something in them wants to reach back. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It’s a very tricky thing to share higher light with people.&nbsp; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">even hate to use the word “higher light.”&nbsp; The other thing</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that happens is you start using terms like that and you start</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">thinking you’re superior to other people; you’re above them. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">And, you’re not.&nbsp; You happen to have been lucky enough maybe to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">fall into this work we’re doing and have huge transformations. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It was luck; it was synchronicity.&nbsp; It was the luck of the draw. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">You could be creating those synchronicities for other people. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There are people out there who are very evolved; the wanderer</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">types.&nbsp; But, they don’t know it.&nbsp; When you come into this realm</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">as a wanderer from a high realm and you’ve gotten covered up,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">stuck, withdrawn – you don’t know you’re a wanderer.&nbsp; You</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">don’t have any idea; you don’t know you had a mission when</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you came here.&nbsp; You just know that your shoulders are tight; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">got a headache; no one loves me; what am I doing?&nbsp; Here you are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this exalted guy who came down from the higher realms and was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going to change the world.&nbsp; You still have time. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">When I was younger – I’m describing myself – I was really</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">uptight.&nbsp; I was a nerd.&nbsp; I had my shoulders up to my ears, my</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">aunt used to come over.&nbsp; She said, “Pull your shoulders down;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what are your shoulders so up for?”&nbsp; I didn’t even know my</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">shoulders were up until she said it.&nbsp; It was like part of my</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">normal way of being.&nbsp; I was all stuck inside with my shoulders up</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">high.&nbsp; Some of you heard the story about how my father had killed</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">me in another lifetime and that he gave me a life this lifetime</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because he killed me in another lifetime.&nbsp; When I was growing up,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I understood now that I had a cellular memory of the death</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">experience with him.&nbsp; He had a cellular memory about, “I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">thought I got rid of this guy; what’s he doing here?”&nbsp; So, he</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was still killing me, and my energies responded.&nbsp; Even when I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">knew the story and I knew how that all worked, my shoulders still</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">didn’t relax; I was rejecting myself.&nbsp; I was rejecting myself</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">for a long time and other people would reject me because I was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">rejecting myself.&nbsp; At a certain point I went through the process</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of forgiving my father and I went through a quantum leap, at a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">certain point, of evolution.&nbsp; I did it; it wasn’t magic.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">was magic, but it wasn’t magic because I was the magic –</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’re the magic.&nbsp; You’re not separated; there is no</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">‘them’ and ‘you’ and there is a ‘them’ and ‘you’.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;You see how duality works?&nbsp; There’s no them and you, we’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">all one.&nbsp; And, there’s a them and you.&nbsp; There’s no you and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">me, except there’s (a) you and me.&nbsp; You’re going to eat your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">dinner tonight; it’s going into your body.&nbsp; I’m going to eat</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">my dinner; I’ve got my roof, you’ve got your roof.&nbsp; (It’s a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">matter of) where do we place ourselves?&nbsp; We’re talking about</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">roofs and I said I was going to talk about finances and money.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">This isn’t an easy one to talk about, because I know there are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a lot of you struggling.&nbsp; I suspect it’s going to get worse.&nbsp; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">could tell you you’re struggling because you’re missing</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">things.&nbsp; I could tell you you’re struggling because there are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">negative forces that want you to struggle, that would like to see</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">things fall apart.&nbsp; I think that could very well be true, and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they don’t care.&nbsp; They’re holding a lot of the cards in their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">hands.&nbsp; All of the above are true.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">What is the key ingredient in moving from where you are?&nbsp; First</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of all, it’s good to be able to suss out the situation; to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">really be honest with it.&nbsp; There is a tendency in people not to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">want to look at things.&nbsp; There is a tendency to be hopeful and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">optimistic, and “things are going to get better.”&nbsp; I hope</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that’s true.&nbsp; Anything I’m saying that seems contrary to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that; (there’s a saying that goes) “hope for the best and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">prepare for the worst.”&nbsp; There are definitely a lot of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">probability vortices out there.&nbsp; What are some of the worst-case</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">scenarios, and what are the best-case scenarios?&nbsp; How do you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">position yourself right now; this is the key.&nbsp; You have to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">position yourself right now so that you can cope.&nbsp; Or else you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can say, “My way of positioning is to say when that comes I’m</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">ready to leave this realm” and you can do that and move on.&nbsp; If</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you feel there are things to do down here; if you feel there are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">things to learn… </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">One of the things about this realm that I’ve heard many, many</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people say, and I can’t validate that it’s true because I’m</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in this realm and I have nothing to compare it to:&nbsp; It’s been</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">said that a being in this realm can grow and expand more than any</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">other realm.&nbsp; In other words, this realm is a locus point for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">many dimensions coming together.&nbsp; Whereas in other dimensions,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">particularly even a higher dimension, I think you’re more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">positioned in that dimension.&nbsp; So if that’s true, all of us are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in the middle of a great opportunity right now because not only</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is it designed where you can grow more; it’s also (that)</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we’re in the middle of a dimensional shift.&nbsp; Whatever your</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">intention is right now has the potential to shift different</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">holograms, bigger energies than ever before in recorded history. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">What does that mean? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It means bringing in synchronicities; it means bringing in new</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">friends; it means, “What are the possibilities?”&nbsp; “What are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">your possibilities?”&nbsp; The first thing you have to think of to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">get into your possibilities is to start thinking out of the box. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The next thing is, spend a certain amount of time doing things</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">without worrying about the results.&nbsp; On the internet now there</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are so many ways to get connected to people that you could have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">never gotten connected to before.&nbsp; There’s Linked-In, there’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">FaceBook, there are so many of the social networks.&nbsp; There’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">somebody on those social networks that needs an employee – how</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">do you find them?&nbsp; I believe that if you can learn the basics of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">internet there are going to be one of the highest potentials for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">an ongoing income.&nbsp; There are things you can do – do searches. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There are a lot of scams so you have to use your discernment. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">All you have to do is think of a question and type it into Google</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and you’ll get 500 answers.&nbsp; “How do I make money on the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">internet?”&nbsp; I guarantee you’ll get a lot of scams, but</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’ll get certain things that are real.&nbsp; Any question you can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">think of, just ask it into Google and the magic genie of Google</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">spits out the answer. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Think of what we had to go through in the past.&nbsp; This work</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we’re doing right now, if it wasn’t for the internet, none of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this would be happening.&nbsp; Not one thing!&nbsp; Maybe it would have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">manifested in a different way, but the internet is almost like a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">technological example of oneness.&nbsp; Suddenly, everything is really</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">close and everyone is very close.&nbsp; Why am I here because of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">internet?&nbsp; I started writing articles for a web magazine.&nbsp; If I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">hadn’t written those articles, I wouldn’t have interviewed</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">David Wilcock; I wouldn’t have met Daphne.&nbsp; I met Daphne</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because I was at a conference writing articles for that web</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">magazine.&nbsp; If there was no web, there would have been no</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">articles.&nbsp; I have been exploring very carefully – there are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people who are going to make millions on the internet, even right</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">now.&nbsp; At least before we get to the place where we all barter. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">That’s invariably going to happen.&nbsp; Because, the ways of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">reaching people and touching people are so complex. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">When a layman thinks of the internet, you think in old-fashioned</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">terms; I did.&nbsp; You think, “Just put an ad up, then people read</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">your ad, then they’re interested in what you have and they come</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and they spend money.”&nbsp; Well that’s like a small part of it. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The difference is, in the old days if you wanted to sell</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">something you had to open a store.&nbsp; You had to imagine that the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">store would be successful in a certain area; you’d have to buy</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">your merchandise and put it in the store and if no one wanted</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what you had, you’d have to go say, “I better try some other</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">merchandise.”&nbsp; Then you’d buy some more merchandise and every</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">few days you’d be buying new merchandise until you figured out</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what people wanted.&nbsp; The thing about the internet is that what</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">would have taken months to figure out in the past, you can figure</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it out in days.&nbsp; It’s all instantaneous.&nbsp; You put a word up,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“I’ve got this.”&nbsp; You use Google Ad Words, you use many of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the ways to get people’s attention.&nbsp; And, if no one is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">interested in what you have – well, they may be interested but</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you may have said it in the wrong way.&nbsp; There’s a better way to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">always say something.&nbsp; So on the internet you can test things,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you can say, “I’ll try this, I’ll try that, I’ll try this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">other product.”&nbsp; You can find someone that needs some talent</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that you have. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There are so many clever people.&nbsp; There is one guy who set up a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">business where – luckily, I have people volunteering,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">transcribing everything but if I happened to have money and I was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">willing to pay people –he has a whole organization of hundreds</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">– I think they are in the Philippines.&nbsp; (There are) hundreds of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Filipinos and people want something transcribed and they go on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and submit (it) and he charges so much per page and he sends it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to one of the Filipino people and a day later it’s transcribed.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;If a guy is writing a book; he can just dictate into the phone</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and in a week he’ll have his whole book written.&nbsp; Think how</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">easy that is!&nbsp; Somebody could do that business in a small way. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Oftentimes when you see somebody doing a business of any kind and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you think how clever that is – you could do that business! </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Maybe you wouldn’t have a hundred Filipinos typing things,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">maybe you would just do it yourself and charge $12 an hour.&nbsp; If</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">typing happened to be one of your talents, go around to local</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">offices and say, “I need to pay my rent; I decided to do this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">service.&nbsp; If you have any dictations, send me the audios and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’ll have the pages up for you the next day.”&nbsp; That’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">creative. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I thought of that because I read this article somewhere about the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">guy with the hundred Filipinos doing it.&nbsp; It triggered me to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">think (about) the process that you can go though to find</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">opportunities.&nbsp; You start doing that for a legal office or some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">kind of office that needs things typed and the guy is going to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">say, “This is cheaper than having a secretary.&nbsp; I don’t have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to pay insurance, I only use her when I need it.”&nbsp; Suddenly,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’re making an extra $70, $80 a day.&nbsp; If you get enough</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">business you can raise the prices and make $160, $200 and you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have a service that as long as there’s any business, as long as</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there are any professionals out there, somebody will use you and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you will be typing things.&nbsp; You’ll be saving them money and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’ll be making enough money to survive and you’ll be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">carrying the frequencies of this love and light wherever you go. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">You won’t be working for someone.&nbsp; If you need to move, as long</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">as there’s an internet, you can continue to do it over the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">internet.&nbsp; You can develop it anywhere you want!&nbsp; You have a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">business. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There are a million undiscovered businesses like that that no one</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is doing.&nbsp; If I had the right person who was really, really sharp</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and could lead other people I’d love to put a business together</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that could be taught and easy that would help people.&nbsp; I’m</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">keeping my eyes open; if you happen to be listening and you’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">one of those people who know how to have leadership and know</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">enough about computers, email me because there’s a great</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">opportunity here that would help raise money for our work, help</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">all the people who are coming on board.&nbsp; I got three ideas</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">already. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’ve come to accept one of the good things about me is I can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">see how things work; I can put patterns together.&nbsp; When I was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">younger, I took it for granted.&nbsp; A couple of times I was with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">someone and I remember I was at an Expo called “The Japanese</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Expo” in Los Angeles.&nbsp; There’s was this Japanese fellow who</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">had this massager that looked two thumbs going around in circles.</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;He had it sitting on a table – this was probably fifteen years</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">ago – and I looked it.&nbsp; I told him, “You’re marketing it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">all wrong.&nbsp; You should take that massager and tie it to a chair. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Put five chairs in a row and invite people to sit down so they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can feel it.”&nbsp; Then, I walked away.&nbsp; A few months later I was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">at a fair and I saw a booth with all these same massagers tied to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the chairs in a row.&nbsp; There was that guy – he did it.&nbsp; He</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">became a millionaire.&nbsp; In the next year or two everywhere in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">country – every festival, every county fair, every home show</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">– had a booth like that selling these massagers.&nbsp; I said,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“How did I not make money on that?”&nbsp; I didn’t really care</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">– he was a nice guy and I said it.&nbsp; So I see how things work,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and if I wasn’t doing what I’m doing right now with this work</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I would be doing something of putting things together and making</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">something work in a big way. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Now, my vision is to make this work in a big way and make this be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the Google of the new paradigm.&nbsp; We have all the tools in place;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I don’t know if you guys can see that or realize that, but the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">tools are in place.&nbsp; We have a template; we have a template that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is working.&nbsp; We’ve gone through the beta test; we’re holding</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy for lots of people and it’s working for them.&nbsp; We’ve</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">done it for nothing and it’s still working.&nbsp; My idea is to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">charge people $35 for six months and look at what they’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">getting! </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">In certain ways, Americans tend to appreciate things when they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">pay for them.&nbsp; It’s almost no money and yet look at the benefit</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">someone could get.&nbsp; They may even get more benefit if they pay</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">money like that as opposed to giving it for free.&nbsp; Of course, it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">needed to be given for free up until now.&nbsp; Why did it need to? </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Because I didn’t know it would work.&nbsp; I don’t want to charge</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">for something that I don’t know is going to work.&nbsp; It’s like</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I have a new medical therapy, and I’m going to say, “I’d</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">like you to come over.&nbsp; I want to try my new therapy of healing</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">on you.&nbsp; Give me $200.”&nbsp; I’d be an idiot; you don’t know if</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it’s going to work, I don’t know if it’s going to work. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">There really was no way to know if this would work except by</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">working it; by creating it.&nbsp; All of you who have been on this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">call have been part of the creation; you’ve been part of the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">beta test; you’ve been holding the energy proving that we can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">do this. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">What are we doing?&nbsp; I don’t even want to put a word to it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because as soon as you put a word to it everyone thinks they know</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what it is; even now I don’t know what it is in a way that I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">could put a word on it.&nbsp; I do know I can jump on it and ride it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">like a surfer.&nbsp; It’s an energy that’s a wave.&nbsp; If we turn</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">into the ‘Google of Spirituality’, that means that all of you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">end up getting jobs that are for holding, for example answering</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the phone.&nbsp; Who is going to know how to support this better than</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you who have been listening on the calls who have been part of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the process?&nbsp; So I’d like you all to just hold that vision. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">It’s not going to happen just because of the vision, by the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">way.&nbsp; It’s going to happen because I made that video</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">www.creatorgodbook.com, and because I decided to be a little more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">courageous, and instead of calling the book Questions and Answers</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">with the Elohim – no one knows who the Elohim is – I called</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it The Creator Gods of the Universe want to talk to you.&nbsp; It’s</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">more like, “What’s he talking about?”&nbsp; Then, I made that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">video and we put the video up.&nbsp; I put the video up, you can go</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">look at it.&nbsp; It’s up on www.creatorgodbook.com. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">If you want to see an interesting website there is a lady who has</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a site called ‘Crystal Links’.&nbsp; There’s only one ‘l’ in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it – www.crystalinks.com.&nbsp; She’s a little Jewish lady in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Brooklyn, her name is Ellie, I can’t remember her last name. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">She’s psychic, she does readings, she’s studied metaphysics</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">all her life.&nbsp; She put up a website called www.crystalinks.com. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">She has everything on it; it’s like a big smorgasbord.&nbsp; Egypt,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">crystals, flying saucers, ETs – I believe she wrote all the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">pages.&nbsp; I think she lives alone and all she does is work this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">website.&nbsp; It gets two million hits a month.&nbsp; We put the video on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">her website and *boom* a hundred people a day signing up.&nbsp; We</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">just put it on two pages of her website, because it costs $50 a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">month per page so I wanted to make sure it worked.&nbsp; I could spend</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">$500 a month with her, I could spend $1,000 a month, but I have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to test it. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">If I’m making money, if I’m charging for things little bits,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">then I can keep affording these kinds of things and all of this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can explode and some of you can have jobs that know how to hold</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the energy for people.&nbsp; Some of the people that are volunteering</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can get paid.&nbsp; Don’t send any applications yet, we’re not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">ready for that.&nbsp; I’m asking you to hold the vision.&nbsp; When you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">look at changing the world, when you look at having enough people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">holding the space for a transformation – probably the last</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">chance for that to happen is the internet.&nbsp; It’s the last</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">chance, and I’m going to work it.&nbsp; If any of you have any ideas</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">please e-mail me and also pat yourself on the back for hanging</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Not everyone hung in – people didn’t hang in.&nbsp; They came and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they went.&nbsp; Some of you have hung in for a few years now – a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">couple years, a year.&nbsp; You’re hanging in – you’d think it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">doesn’t matter, but it does.&nbsp; It creates a path and a track in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the consensus reality; it creates a ground for this work.&nbsp; As it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">gets more grounded it can have more reach.&nbsp; This is not easy to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">get grounded because it doesn’t have an easy ground in the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">world.&nbsp; Where do you plant it?&nbsp; If you go to a book publisher–</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">if you’re lucky you might find one – but the chances are,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’d plant it at the book publisher and no one would ever see</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it.&nbsp; It would just be sitting there hoping that somebody would</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">see it because he’d never put any money into it.&nbsp; Where do you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">plant it?&nbsp; Do you open up a building, call it a church and invite</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">everyone to come over and say, “Hey, do you want to hear</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">God?”&nbsp; That won’t work.&nbsp; There’s no place to plant it. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Maybe you guys don’t understand that but I did.&nbsp; I was hitting</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">my head against the wall.&nbsp; “Where do I plant this?&nbsp; It’s so</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">crazy, it’s so out there.”</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Somebody just sent me an e-mail saying, “I thought Wilcock was</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">out there” – this is somebody who just downloaded the book</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and I read it – “but you’re even further out than</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Wilcock.”&nbsp; I’m not saying that in hierarchal way that I’m</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">better than him, but the experience that we are putting into the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">world front and center is real.&nbsp; All of you have been coming into</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this line all the time, it’s like you lose track of how far out</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it is.&nbsp; I lose track of it.&nbsp; It’s very easy just to stay within</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the confines of all of the people who hold the space and are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">comfortable in doing it, rather than going out and put myself</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">somewhere else.&nbsp; Every time I put myself out into something new I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">hold my breath and say, “I hope this is okay,”&nbsp; because</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there’s always a concern, this is so controversial that you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">could get people chasing you around the block for doing it.&nbsp; It</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">has to be done really carefully and thought out and tested</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because it’s not like anything else; it has different</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">implications than anything else.&nbsp; It’s not easy to see that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">when you’ve been coming into the lines for months and become</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">part of the energy here.&nbsp; It just becomes normal, but you’ve</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">changed your lives.&nbsp; This energy here has helped do it.&nbsp; You’ve</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">empowered yourself; you’ve made connection with these sources</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in other realms.&nbsp; You’re living day-to-day with these new</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">friends, some of you.&nbsp; Some of you are still working through</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">stuff.&nbsp; Don’t judge yourself if you’re working through stuff</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because you’ll get through it.&nbsp; We’re putting out what people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">need to get through their stuff.&nbsp; So don’t judge yourself. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I hope I talked enough about money – that was the topic.&nbsp; We</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">had all those Benjamin Franklins there.&nbsp; I’m thinking about</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">what I said, there are things I know would make money in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">today’s economy, I know it.&nbsp; I have the vision to see things; I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">just have to be very careful about what I personally take</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">responsibility for because this work is too important. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Somebody sharp, I’d say let’s try something – I’d do it. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’d work it with someone and let them learn how to do it and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">then train other people.&nbsp; We’re doing that with some people on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">different things right now but it’s all volunteer; there’s no</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">money.&nbsp; We’re still figuring out how to make ends meet, but</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it’s getting a lot better. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’m not going back and charging for ‘Message a Day’; (but)</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">on the people that sign up on the www.creatorgodbook.com I’m</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">not going to announce ‘Message a Day’ to them.&nbsp; I’m going</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to announce it as a six-month subscription program for $35.&nbsp; For</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">$35 they’re getting:&nbsp; ‘Message a Day’, invitation to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">conference calls, invitation to Team Shift.&nbsp; We (now) have people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">volunteering for all of that; that’s the only reason that is</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">going on.&nbsp; I couldn’t possibly be doing this myself.&nbsp; I would</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">love to see all those people who are volunteering quit their jobs</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and get paid to do this full-time.&nbsp; That’s the vision; you can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">all share in that vision.&nbsp; In this realm, money is power.&nbsp; In</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">addition to anchoring energies, the more stable and secure you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are the better anchor you will be for higher dimensional</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energies.&nbsp; I’m going to shut up; I’ve given Terry a break,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’ve talked a lot tonight.&nbsp; It’s 6:48 – Terry?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> I’m here.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> I heard you say yes, I guess you are there.&nbsp; Do you want</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to have a conversation with them?&nbsp; You don’t have to; do they</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">want to talk?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:</strong>&nbsp; Sure.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; For anyone who is listening who is new, Terry is what some</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people call a channel.&nbsp; She’s learned how to blend her energies</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">into other realms and bring through an intelligence that explains</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">themselves to be group souls.&nbsp; Not only are they intelligences in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">other realms, they have the ability to flow energy into this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">realm.&nbsp; If you want to read the whole story, I’m giving the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">book away for free – don’t miss the chance.&nbsp; Get</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">www.creatorgodbook.com.&nbsp; Just sign up or look at video and read</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the book.&nbsp; Share it with other people; that’s the big thing. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Just send it to everybody and say, “You got to read this.&nbsp; This</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">guy is doing something really interesting.&nbsp; It’s really changed</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">my life.”&nbsp; However is authentic for you, but just get it out</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there.&nbsp; If we do that and they do that and they do that, one of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the things that is happening is that there are a lot of people</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">floundering right now.&nbsp; There are a lot of reasons to be afraid</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">right now.&nbsp; We’re throwing people life rafts.&nbsp; It doesn’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">mean we can pay their bills or that some calamity isn’t going</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to happen around them.&nbsp; What it does mean is that many of those</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">people will stay out of fear and some of them will graduate this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">realm who may not have otherwise. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">When you do this, it is a great, great service you’re doing to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">tell other people about the work we’re doing.&nbsp; The easiest way</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to do it is to give the book away. I want you to know when I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">decide to do things like this, I don’t ask them.&nbsp; I don’t</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">even feel that it’s “right” (to ask them).&nbsp; In some ways</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">from their level, they’re not here, they can’t see all the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">possibilities.&nbsp; Some people think, “Wynn talks to the Elohim,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they tell him everything.”&nbsp; They don’t do that.&nbsp; If they did</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I probably wouldn’t be talking to them because I’m too</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">strong-willed, I’m too self-directed.&nbsp; As I’ve learned how</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they work, they want co-creative relationships; they want to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">connect as equals.&nbsp; Even though they have a larger hologram,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">there is seamlessness in the connection.&nbsp; We’re going to talk</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to them. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">One of the unique things about what we’re doing is that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they’re not just an intelligence talking through Terry.&nbsp; If we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have it all right, they are at the center of the universe and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they can project energy through the entire universe.&nbsp; They need</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">beings, as far as I can tell, who can turn into the energies;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">otherwise they don’t go anywhere.&nbsp; What we’ve been learning</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">how to do on these lines is to tune into the energy, and we feel</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">it.&nbsp; If you’ve come into these calls regularly, particularly</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">our Sunday call, that energy that is focused on feeling the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energies.&nbsp; It’s very, very powerful and so I encourage you to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">check it out.&nbsp; I’m going to get a bunch of emails saying,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">“Wynn you talk too much; how come you don’t let Terry</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">talk?”&nbsp; Terry, is there anything you want to say on your human</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">side?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Terry:&nbsp;</strong> No, I’m pretty much into the channeling …</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:&nbsp;</strong> Father Mother God we ask for the presence of the light to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">surround and protect each person on this line, and any negativity</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">be taken to the higher realms of light and transmuted for the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">highest good of all concerned.&nbsp; We see ourselves in the flow of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energy radiating from the center of the universe, through the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">galaxies, through the planets, through our bodies and into the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">center of the earth.&nbsp; Right now we invoke a group energy</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">connection, a blending of our souls, while maintaining our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sovereign integrity of our individualities.&nbsp; We invite those</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">sources that are positive, service-to-others, honoring the Law of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">One; to join with us and we create a protected space that only</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the positive has access to, and anything not of that nature must</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">leave now.&nbsp; Do we have our sources present?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes, this is Ra’An.&nbsp; We greet you in the love light</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of the One Infinite Creator.&nbsp; This is July 18th, 2011.&nbsp; We are</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">delighted to be with you and to make contact today, whenever you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">may hear the audio of this or whenever you may read any</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">transcript of this, we are delighted to make contact with you. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">We are mindful of the subject that you have presented tonight. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">One time we said, “Due to our lack of experience, we do not</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">have a total grasp of money; however, we have a grasp of love and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">connection.&nbsp; We realize that it is through connection and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">communication that you are able to bring energy to yourself and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">exchange energy and give energy to others.&nbsp; It is through</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">communication and making contact with others and supporting each</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">other that you learn how you may help others and may then be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">remunerated for this.&nbsp; We look at China and we see the economy in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">China getting better and we know that the people in that country</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">are willing to exchange services, even though it was not for a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">lot of money.&nbsp; By being willing to provide what was needed, their</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">economy and society is getting stronger. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Those are essentially the things that we wanted to bring up; we</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">also applaud Wynn Free for thinking of how to eventually provide</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">jobs for individuals who are able and willing to contribute, and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can supply needed services and to exchange it for remuneration</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">when there is enough demand that money is flowing into the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">coffers and the availability of jobs can be remunerated.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">tasks that people perform can be remunerated and compensated with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">money.&nbsp; This is sorely needed, and the economy at this time. </span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Those are our thoughts.&nbsp; Do you have questions?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I’ll make some questions up on the line of topic. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">I’ve looked at the way synchronicities work; the way something</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">new comes in.&nbsp; This is true with me as well.&nbsp; You get into a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">comfortable place and you’re not getting what you want,</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">you’re not at the place you want to be, but you’re</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">comfortable.&nbsp; To get to the place where you want to be you have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to make yourself uncomfortable.&nbsp; I happen to be very willing to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">do that; I’ve done it over and over again in the past years</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">because if I wanted to do something I would do it even if I had</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to sleep in my car to do it. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">The people who want something to happen have to create a movement</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">of frequency outside of their protected space; they have to have</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a movement of energy so that their energy moves into arenas where</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">someone else picks it up and reaches back.&nbsp; Everything starts on</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the other side; everything starts in other realms.&nbsp; I can kind of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">see how that works, even my human side, that I will see that I</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">did something months ago and I met somebody months ago and it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">looked like it was going to go nowhere.&nbsp; Months later the energy</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">is still there and they come back. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">One of the things about synchronicities is you have to hold the</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">intention of a result, but you can’t look for the result; you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can’t expect the result.&nbsp; You have to go into the arena where</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the result could happen.&nbsp; I think when that happens I think you</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">guys can help; you can find things and help lubricate it.&nbsp; When</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">somebody is just sitting,“Do this for me, do that for me, do</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">this for me, help me get money, help me get a job…” -- how</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">does that look to you when they’re saying “Elohim help us”</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">or “Ra help us”.&nbsp; What do they have to do to get that WD-40</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">spread in the matrix so that they can get what they’re really</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">asking for?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An</strong>:&nbsp; We see that an individual can raise themselves up a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">notch to move into a creative zone.&nbsp; It is in the creative zone</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">where an individual can move into creation.&nbsp; If they’re merely</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">in the zone that already has been created, then he is limited by</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the factors involved in that positioning&nbsp; because if an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">individual needs to earn money, they need to move out of the box</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that they’re in if they are not earning money, and move into a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">zone where they can get that money flowing in in exchange for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">something. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">In the corporate arena, there are still many jobs available for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">individuals who can provide a service for that corporation;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">however, within that framework, they need to fit so that they can</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">provide the service and fit into the corporation.&nbsp; However, an</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">individual, even if they have one of these jobs, may like to move</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">into a more creative job or a job that makes more money and as</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">such, if they wish to work for themselves they can set the object</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">to work a little bit each day on learning a new skill; learning</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">photography, learning the internet, learning PowerPoint, Access;</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">learning Word.&nbsp; Some of the skills that will help them even if</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">they move into something on their own and can, although while</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">still working within a framework, can step out of the framework</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">for a short period each day to learn skills that are oriented</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">towards what the individual wishes that they could be doing and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">earning money within another area.&nbsp; It does not have to be all</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">learned at one time or looked at as a maze of things that have to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">be accomplished all at one; it can take a little bit each day and</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">increase their skills.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; What do you think of my idea of having Message</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">a Day become the ‘Google of the new paradigm’?&nbsp; Do you think</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that’s possible?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:&nbsp;</strong> We see a comparison of Google to Message a Day…</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Maybe a mini-Google; perhaps it’s an over-stretch.&nbsp; The</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">idea is to plant it solidly as something that is on the internet</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that people will hear about and people that are attracted to it</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">can find it.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; It is a nice thought and a good goal that could be</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">implemented and we, in looking at Google, see that they have a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">unique philosophy of creativity.&nbsp; The employees take part in this</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">creativity and there are many aspects that serve many needs that</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">individuals want and so Message a Day could be broadened to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">service individuals in broader needs.&nbsp; This is a good thought to</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">work towards and develop.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Could we hypothesize that Google is a good example of a</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">company that is built on the energies of Indigo and Crystal</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">children in the way they conduct themselves?</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; There are many individuals working for Google</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">that are very bright and are using their skills to interface with</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">society in ways that are needed, very needed.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; I’m not going to over-tax Terry; thank you so much for</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">joining with us tonight.&nbsp; Do you have any closing words?&nbsp; (And)</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">we’ll say goodbye.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Ra’An:</strong>&nbsp; We are very pleased with the thoughts for expansion in</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the area and we are with you and behind you and are making our</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">energies available and we move our energies in a broader range</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">over earth and we send support to all light workers, all families</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">everywhere – mothers and fathers – that are working towards</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the good of the family, as families are one of the strengths of</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">the fabric of the human experience.&nbsp; We send our light to each</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">and every person that is listening.&nbsp; Adonai.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Wynn:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank everyone here, thank Terry, (and) thank</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">our volunteers. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;">Anyone wants to contribute any money so we can do more</span><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;

I think that’s all.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>All:&nbsp;</strong> Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you. It was wonderful.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: large;"><strong>Gijs:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you all very much.</span><br /><br /><br /></p>
