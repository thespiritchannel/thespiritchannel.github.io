<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is Monday, January 30<sup>th</sup> [2012], and this is our <i>Monday Night Call</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are honored to have everyone who is on the call here, because you guys that are regulars know that this call is a co-creation.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not just “you’re listening to us,” it’s also “us is you”. It’s an energy that we co-create together.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you’re here putting in your energy, your love and your attention, it becomes part of the energy of the call that radiates out to the universe.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Tonight is a very special call, because we have Carla Rueckert with us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Carla, somebody doesn’t like you!<span>&nbsp; </span>Carla Rueckert has been our regular guest once a month on Mondays.<span>&nbsp; </span>Really, if it wasn’t for Carla I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing; I don’t believe David Wilcock would be doing what he’s doing, because she pioneered something in the early 1980’s where a voice came through her.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you saw the email that I sent out today, I sent a picture of you with your little thing above your head when you were younger than you are now – I also sent a current picture and a Law of One picture on the book, <i>The Law of One</i>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This voice came through Carla. She was working with a gentleman by the name of Don Elkins.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don was a very smart Ph.D. and Carla was one of his students in what would be called a channeling class or “Connecting with Extra-Terrestrials” class.<span>&nbsp; </span>Carla became his star pupil when one day he asked a question and suddenly this voice came through and said “I am Ra.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Ra defined itself as a social memory complex that was made up of graduates of the physical universe; souls that had passed through and gotten to a place where they were in a higher dimension than physicality and they acted as a group to help beings that were still stuck in this realm, like you and I.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope I’m not stuck – I don’t know!<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t think I’m stuck; you never know until you’re gone.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Four books of Ra channelings later, wherein this group soul explained who they were, how they operated, how to connect with them, their history on the planet, how they connected with the Egyptians and how they connected with probably even Atlantis <span>&nbsp;</span>– it was an historic and controversial release of information from the other side.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s influenced many people.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many people call it the most credible, precise channeling in history.<span>&nbsp; </span>I met Carla when I first started researching the book on David Wilcock and studied her material.<span>&nbsp; </span>It all connected; all the things connected with what I was working on.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Carla has been rehabilitating from a series of operations – two spinal fusions [and eight debridements to clean out wound site infections].<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s been serious and she hasn’t been able to join with us in the past months.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was so pleased to get an email from her this morning saying, “I think I’m ready.”</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I decided to invite Suzanne Hayes to be on the show with us because Suzanne is one of those people who was greatly influenced by <i>The Ra Material</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>She and Carla have never met. She’s run blogs on <i>The Ra Material</i> in our group.<span>&nbsp; </span>She’s done discussion groups on <i>The Ra Material</i>, and Suzanne is also in a rehabilitation home recovering from her own medical circumstance.<span>&nbsp; </span>I thought the topic tonight would be “How to be a spiritual person and go through what would be a really difficult physical experience” - like pain, like spinal fusion.<span>&nbsp; </span>Suzanne and Carla would be great to talk about that because they both have gone through that.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There’s a complexity to receiving if you’re spiritual, because most people give with strings attached, and if you’re coming from a high spiritual place you don’t want any strings.<span>&nbsp; </span>How do you figure out how to receive and to allow the receiving to happen without getting strings attached?<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you have to pick the right people, or do you have to pick the correct response, no matter what the other person’s intent is?</span></p>

You’re quailing!<span>&nbsp; </span>I will try my best to let you , back in.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have a lot to say about the experience of receiving blessings from others as well as giving.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I think the first thing I would say about that is you have to realize we’re all one.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whether you think you’re on the giving end or the receiving end, it’s really all one transaction.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The second thing I would say about that is it’s the hardest thing in the world for most service-to-others-oriented people to do is to accept the love-offerings of others.<span>&nbsp; </span>The more credit that other people give you for being high-vibrational and spiritual and so forth, the more crushing it is to you that you know your own secret thoughts.<span>&nbsp; </span>You know you’re an idiot; you know that you make a thousand mistakes a day, and that you are not worthy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Nobody really can convince you in any quantitative way that you’re wrong, because you know what you’re thinking and so forth.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our culture is very strong on crediting people for their outer work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nobody ever comes up to you at a party and says “How do you be?”<span>&nbsp; </span>They say “What do you do?”<span>&nbsp; </span>And, you say “Well I do this and blah blah blah.”<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s very easy.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">If what you’re doing at the moment is resting in bed while you are maintaining a vibration within your being that allows the love and the light of the one infinite Creator to flow through you and out into the world, you’re actually involved in being rather than doing.<span>&nbsp; </span>You are being that channel that allows the light through. And you even are giving it your color, the color of your personality and the flashes and the glints of your imperfections.<span>&nbsp; </span>All of those are beautiful to the Creator.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">All of these things are involved not in doing, but in being.<span>&nbsp; </span>This culture does not credit or find worthy people who simply are.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I was operated on in April of 2011 – that’s almost long enough ago that I could have had a child by now if I had gotten pregnant then – it was eight months ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>The operation itself went very well, but I came out of hospital with – count them – five different infections in the site of the surgical wound and I kept having to go back in and get scraped off in operation after operation.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think there were nine of them altogether trying to get rid of these infections.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nothing worked except something called a wound vac, which I’m on now.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">With a wound vac you’re completely limited – you have about four feet of play [in the cord of the pump] – just enough to get from here to the potty.<span>&nbsp; </span>Other than that, you’re stuck.<span>&nbsp; </span>[A wound vac is] a machine that keeps you from getting more infection. It takes the infection away very slowly and gradually. It’s a wonderful thing – it closes the wound all by itself.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m on this, have been on it for months and I will probably be on it for another six months, something like that.<span>&nbsp; </span>The doctor won’t say – everybody’s different.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have been doing a lot of being.<span>&nbsp; </span>The wonderful thing about that is that I’ve been doing it for long enough now that I’m absolutely positive that I am worthy and that we’re all worthy, not because of what we do, but because of who we are and how we react to circumstances.<span>&nbsp; </span>We don’t have to be worthy of anything; all we need to do is spend our time as best we can, intending to match our vibratory level to the level of unconditional love.<span>&nbsp; </span>We spend time resting in the Creator’s love, and there is plenty of time to do that when you’re in bed, a lot of time for inner work. It’s a real blessing if you think of it that way.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can count your blessings when you’re not busy doing other things.<span>&nbsp; </span>It gives you so many chances for service to others, but they are not what people generally think of when they think of service to others.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">If somebody asks you “Have you heard of Carla?”<span>&nbsp; </span>[you’d say], “Oh yeah – she’s this channel.<span>&nbsp; </span>She teaches, etc.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Hopefully there are people in this world that are aware - and if they’re not it’s okay – that the most important thing any of us does is be who we are – exactly, specifically, creatively, spontaneously, who we are and allow the Creator’s love and light to flow through us.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then, no matter how imperfect the intentions of people who want to serve you by taking care of you, you can see the beauty of that and you can give thanks for that.<span>&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t matter if perhaps you get your feelings hurt or something of that kind – it’s all right; everything’s all right.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’re a strong person. You’re not a weak person.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’re not powerless. You have all the power in the world flowing through you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your intention is everything.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is what it is to be a metaphysically oriented or a spiritually oriented person and to live what you believe.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not so much what you do; it’s how you do it.<span>&nbsp; </span>If all you’re doing is doing things, you may not be expressing your being very much.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s why Wynn doesn’t like to say how he is, because he’s not very how – he just is.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s what he’s trying to get across; he just doesn’t have the words.<span>&nbsp; </span>I understand him perfectly.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I had a book come out on December 6<sup>th</sup>, and it was really neat because I haven’t been able to do channeling for a while – obviously, you don’t do stuff like that on pain pills. You’re not in the right zone.<span>&nbsp; </span>You don’t give chances to the loyal opposition to get hold of you when you’re not totally in a controlled channeling state.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have not done any channeling work [since the April operaton].<span>&nbsp; </span>Work that I did in the ‘90’s was found by North Atlantic Publishing and it was co-channeling with a lady named Barbara Brodsky who channels a wonderful master of the Buddhist persuasion named Aaron.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s called <i>The Aaron-Q’uo Dialogues.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">What I’ve always said about this particular work is that when you pick up <i>The Aaron Q’uo Dialogues</i>, within a couple of pages of starting to read it you’re going to hit something that is important that day.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s magical material.<span>&nbsp; </span>Believe it or not, what I read today in Morning Offering.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial;">[1]</span></span></span></span> I’m going to read to you now and you’ll just be amazed at how apt it is.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is from Weekend One, page 32, of <i>The Aaron/Q’uo Dialogues.</i></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I asked Aaron, “I’ve been working to learn to value being as opposed to doing.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s very important to me because my physical abilities are more and more limited.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you have suggestions on how I can best proceed on this line of seeking?”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Aaron says, “In being, you are doing.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He goes on to say, “I see you as light; each of you radiates a very beautiful and unique pattern of light.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you are being in the most pure way possible for you, you allow that universal energy to flow through you and out, so that you become charged with the love of the universe; with the love of God.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then the light that channels through is enhanced by your own inner energy so that there are truly two sources of light.<span>&nbsp; </span>You are each a spark of God.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then he goes on to say further on down, “It does not work the other way.<span>&nbsp; </span>In doing you are not always channeling that love and light so clearly; rather, you are using your energy, feeling that something must be done and that you in yourself are not sufficient.<span>&nbsp; </span>As you allow this energy-flow, the doing becomes simply another way of being.”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I thought that I would share that with you.

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We all get hooked, to some extent, on outward manifestation.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you see somebody outwardly manifesting, on the one hand you’re receiving the energy level from which they’re coming.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everybody manifests at a different level of – we could say ‘energy’ or ‘space in the hologram’ – whether they’re channeling or whether they’re being human.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I used to go through this when I was younger. You would see somebody who had a great outward manifestation.<span>&nbsp; </span>On one hand, you’re receiving their outward manifestation and being lifted, and on the other hand you are comparing yourself to them and feeling worthless, because, “Look at what they’re doing and I want to do it!”</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So many people say, “I want to channel too; I want to channel.”<span>&nbsp; </span>When people say that – “I want to channel” - because you see the outward manifestation of someone else, oftentimes that would attract a negative source.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s not a pure enough intent to want to channel because you were moved by someone else who is channeling.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I learned when I was younger – I would be going through the course of having different conversations with people and sometimes something would click in.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or, when I would write songs and poems there would be this *click” where suddenly I was wiser than I normally was; I was more polished than I normally was – I said “Where did that come from?”<span>&nbsp; </span>I realized – I don’t know if one would say it was channeling <i>per se</i> – but, I was accessing high levels of my own being.<span>&nbsp; </span>Things were coming through me, and that can happen in normal conversations.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wynn</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>Everyone’s a channel.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you notice – and probably everyone notices this as you go through the course of your day and you’re talking to different people - each person you talk to will talk to you differently.<span>&nbsp; </span>[You will notice] if you’re being the least bit sensitive – automatically.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You’re on subconscious levels picking up the energies of that person, and there is something beyond your logical mind that is putting it together so you know how to choose vocabulary, concepts – whatever – to get across to that person.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everyone has that ability.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are with someone and you start tuning into that part of you that’s being as opposed to doing you will access that.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Oftentimes, you have to wait and not engage in the normal pattern of engagement, because you want to please the person; you want to entertain them.<span>&nbsp; </span>You want them to like you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, your communication is all built around that as opposed to finding the level of being in yourself where you actually reach the other person.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has to do with going into neutral.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It was not easy for me to do this in the beginning.<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn’t understand. [I thought] that I should be able to give all and I could not accept that they would give.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I realized:<span>&nbsp; </span>it’s just as important to allow people to give to you as it is to always expect for you to do the giving.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s very important.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I remember, in <i>Conversations with God<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial;">[3]</span></b></span></span></span></i>, Neale Donald Walsch said (or, whoever was speaking through him said) that you can’t do something for someone else that doesn’t come right back to you.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re feeling a bit down and you call somebody and cheer them up, you can’t help but cheer yourself up at the same time.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As you learn how to do this, I think its how you open up to receive from the universe because you become a little cell of universal consciousness, not just your little human cell.<span>&nbsp; </span>[You’re] walking around on this planet as a universal flow or a walking prayer.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Carla</span></b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">:<span>&nbsp; </span>The thing about pain is that some pain is very useful, it gives you good information.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most pain is not a signal; it’s just noise.<span>&nbsp; </span>In managing pain what you have to do is identify which of your symptoms are interesting informationally and which of your symptoms are just static on the line.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I’m not saying that because you can make the pain go away; I’m saying that because it helps you to manage the pain.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">For instance, I’m not in a situation where I can really get into a creative space and hold it for very long because I’m on pain medication. But I have been able to find things to do because creative people create stuff in real time and they don’t get back to editing it for years at a time.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">For a long time I was working on a future project of mine which involved formatting recipes.<span>&nbsp; </span>I want to do a series of books that will be an accompaniment to somebody who has the care of a family – one volume for each season.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has a little something for the spirit for the day; it’s got a recipe or two.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has a funny picture to make you laugh; it’s got a tip on how to get blood out of linen.<span>&nbsp; </span>You know, a two-page spread to accompany you.<span>&nbsp; </span>I want to do a series of four books that are seasonal in nature, just to share with people the joy of living moment to moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was formatting the 2,000 recipes or so that I’ve collected over a lifetime.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I finished doing that last October or so. Then I turned to the poetry of my lifetime.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m no good really as a poet; I’ve never tried to be a good poet.<span>&nbsp; </span>Things come to me [that] just say, “Write me down!”<span>&nbsp; </span>I rush and I go get a pen and paper, or the typewriter, or the computer – depending upon what decade we’re talking - and get it down because it’s coming through.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have all these pieces of paper.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Last October I started working on my poetry.<span>&nbsp; </span>The great thing about formatting a recipe or editing a poem is that you only have to hold your focus for five or ten or fifteen or twenty minutes and that is doable even if you’re in a lot of pain. And then you can let it go for a while and rest.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, you can get it together again and work again.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve found that to be a really good way to do what I can to keep up with some kind of small service to others in terms of outer work.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">That is a very helpful way to look at pain:<span>&nbsp; </span>is it signal or is it noise? And not to give yourself a single moment for a pity party because that’s an expenditure of energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everything we do takes energy and when you’re not well, when your body is challenged, you have less energy than usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>Heaven knows you do not want to waste an iota – a scintilla – of energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you’re feeling sorry for yourself - you just lost a day, hon. <span>&nbsp;</span>There it goes!<span>&nbsp; </span>Wave it goodbye because you’re not going to get it back for a while.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Decades ago I really learned that feeling sorry for yourself, having self-pity, was useless for me.<span>&nbsp; </span>It might be helpful for other people because they’ve never had this happen to them before and they need to express it out loud:<span>&nbsp; </span>“This is outrageous!”<span>&nbsp; </span>But, if it’s happening to you on a daily basis for your lifetime, as it has to me, then you kind of realize that you need to take your shots.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I really have done wonders with a class I took in 1992 called “Pain Management.”<span>&nbsp; </span>It was an in-hospital course; it lasted three weeks.<span>&nbsp; </span>It really taught you to identify and manage pain – and, if it needed attention you gave it all the attention that it needed.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it was simply noise – static on the line and something that was unfortunate, but there it is – once you’ve done everything you could with pain medication and eating well and doing your exercises – whatever it is you needed to do; then, you work around it.<span>&nbsp; </span>You distract yourself or you can count your blessings.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I always have a great husband, I have wonderful people all around me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Every day I get letters from all over the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m such a lucky gal and so I’ve basically spent a lot of time counting my blessings.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I can’t do anything else I can sure just think, “Isn’t that just wonderful?<span>&nbsp; </span>That is so uplifting,” and look at a thank-you note somebody’s written me because they’ve read something I’ve written for the first time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Golly Moses, that’s just a real blessing.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You do what you can.<span>&nbsp; </span>You said it, Wynn, and, as you also said it, Suzanne: you do it a day at a time; you do it a moment at a time.<span>&nbsp; </span>You focus on the now as so many people have said.<span>&nbsp; </span>You put yourself as consciously and completely into the moment as you can and you relate passionately and just out there with that moment of now and give yourself to that and let yourself be in that moment all that you can be.<span>&nbsp; </span>Love all you can and appreciate all you can and give thanks all you can.<span>&nbsp; </span>You work around the pain that way, and the pain becomes not very interesting and you just sort of work around it and move on.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gradually, hopefully – I will get into a place where there is much less of that and I will be living a much more normal life and be able to do outer things again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Wynn, that’s the way I handle pain.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t duck it; I don’t deny it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I even get into it sometimes; if it’s bad enough, I will go into it and I will say “These are the sufferings of the world.”<span>&nbsp; </span>If I could take the sufferings of the world on myself and everybody else got to go free – I’d do that.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would just lie in that space and offer myself.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">For a moment, let’s focus that repeater-station energy on Carla and Suzanne, for their healing.<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ll just a very short moment of silence.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you need that for yourself, take it for yourself – you are worthy to be healed.<span>&nbsp; </span>You are worthy to be connected.</span></p>
