We see ourselves in the flow of energy radiating from the center of the Universe, through the galaxies, through the Milky Way, through the outer energy fields of the planets, through the energy fields of Earth, through our bodies and into the center of the Earth. Right now we invoke a group energy connection while maintaining the sovereign integrity of our souls. We invite those Sources that are positive, service to others, honoring The Law of One, to join with us and we create a protective space that only the Positive has access to. Anything not of that nature must leave <i>now</i>. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Let me hear one word from Daphne before she gives an introduction. I’ll make sure she’s unmuted. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Daphne:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Hi. Hello. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Wynn:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Ok, we hear you, so go ahead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Daphne:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One moment please. They’re asking me also to bracket<span style="color: #00b0f0;"> </span>this group; they want to call it The Christed Light or The Christ Consciousness, which in effect is The Law of One, if that’s alright with everyone. Give me a moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Council of Ahn (through Daphne):</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Greetings to you on this later day of February in your calendar year 2012. It has been some time since we have addressed this group and brought forth particulars of the experience of disseminating information regarding the Ascension process from our dimensionality into your dimensionality. It is a multi-tiered and multi-faceted process which moves in fits and starts and people will find themselves at different pathways and in different circumstances and at different levels of convergence with each other and with their connections to God-self and their Higher Self. Have you specific questions for us this day?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This morning I just wanted to have a greeting through Daphne for all the people here. Is there anything you’d like to share in terms of what a person can do personally in the best way to prepare themselves for the times we’re in?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Council of Ahn (through Daphne):</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We thank you for your question and this is a very pertinent question. We are in times where the exterior influences, as you would say, the external media, the external frequencies of mass consciousness of the collective consciousness, are strong. As put a hypnotic affect, the hypnotic role in gathering people into a fearful or over excitable condition, whereby they would be reactive or overly reactive to external stimuli, which is not in fact the truth of the particular being’s situation, though the certain powers that be would have you think that it is the truth. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">To remove yourselves from these influences is not, in today’s modern society, altogether easy. It is a process of discernment and selection and attunement with those forces which you find uplifting, with selective and limited exposure to media and this includes the Internet, to radio and television and to discern those Sources in your life which bring you a feeling of upliftment, a feeling of freedom, a feeling of joy and those sources which bring you either static or even worse a feeling of disruption, a feeling of entropy, a feeling of chaotic confusion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>It is a process, an ongoing process, of weeding out and being able to literally attune oneself to that which is helpful and that which is non-helpful. Sometimes this means physically removing oneself from a situation. Sometimes when this is not possible, one has to come up with other creative solutions to work around the particular frequency which is causing the problem. That said, have you other questions. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Well, one thing that seems somewhat inevitable is an economic collapse. So, is it a good idea to store food at this time, and food and water to prepare for that, in case there are disruptions of transportation?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Council of Ahn (through Daphne):</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can you repeat the last sentence? Your voice is not clear on our end.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was asking that many people are predicting an economic collapse and is this a good time to store some food and water in preparation for possible disruptions of transportation and sources. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Council of Ahn (through Daphne):</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, we understand your question, thank you for your question. In terms of probable reality at this point in the time-space continuum, as we see it, The Council of Ahn, it is still unknown. There are many factors at play. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">However, it is always prudent to be as self-sufficient in your daily living habituation and your working habituation as you can be. Especially those who are living in the more rural areas who have access to a place they can either grow or store food, and have access also to perhaps a bartering system of some sort with neighbors and people in the local towns. This is to be encouraged, a self sufficiency of a more simple time, an earlier time. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">You will find this comforting and very much more need-fulfilling than being caught up in the artificial commerce and the inflated structures of the false economy, which is in place now and running wild with people’s emotions, people’s fears, and people’s proclamations of who and what they are, and what ought to be done. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">This entity now finds herself living in a part of the country which is not as flexible in its ideas in thinking as the western most part of the United States and Alaska where she most recently found herself for a number of years. So there’s an adjustment being made here which is not wholly easy or wholly smooth. And we can go into more of that later also for others of yourselves who find their physical environment somewhat at odds with their interior alignments. More questions?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No, I think that will be all and I thank you so much for coming forth and giving us this transmission through Daphne. And I welcome your presence through Daphne on the rest of our call. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Council of Ahn (through Daphne):</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are grateful to have the opportunity to speak with you. This is the Council of Ahn and we bid you good day. Adonai, Adonai, Pax Christos, Aum, Shanti, Shanti, Shantihi.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you very much. And for those of you who are wondering, the Council of Ahn was the first intelligence that spoke to us through Daphne that was part of the Elohim. When I asked about who the Council of Ahn was, they said that it was the division of the Elohim that was responsible for converting a local language two ways into a form that the Elohim could understand. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">And in terms of food, I would suggest that one of the best ways to do this is: if you can find a ninety-nine cents store or a Big Lots store or maybe there’s some store like that near you. They have lots of canned foods for a dollar, sometimes less, sometimes two for a dollar. When you are storing things, it’s best not to store acidic type foods, because the acid can tend to leach toxins from the metal of the can. But a hundred dollars can go really far in having a little extra reserve, like an insurance policy, just in case it’s ever needed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">On that note, we’ll continue we’ll continue with our regular format and we’ll be putting things in the Light. [People put things in the light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">[Wynn and Jackie call in the light.]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Ra’An (through Terry):</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you. We greet you in the Love Light of The One Infinite Creator. This is Ra’An; we thank Daphne so much for her connection with us and the Council of Ahn and we are One. We reach and are available and touch each person on the line who wishes to be connected and we are honored and delighted for the opportunity to connect. We are aware of your personal issues and of the people you wish to be healed who are around you and wish to have an easier time. [Ra’An gives specifics for people who have asked for assistance with things.] </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We send Love Light to help balance energies of the people of Earth at this time. The energies of coping with the financial difficulties and being able to individually make one’s self stronger and bigger, to be able to encompass and deal with the difficulties so one may grow and become stronger as an individual and learn to be balanced in spite of difficulties. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We take a moment and we send healing energy to all sentient beings everywhere, that they may transcend the darkness and come into the Light. The angels, the elves, the fairies, the elementals, we send Love Light to all of these groups, as they have their own group consciousness and individuality. And these groups are delighted at the connection. And some of the elves and the fairies dance in this Love Light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">To the homeless everywhere, we send love and support that they may wake from their stupor [or other problems] and they may begin to touch their own opening, to open their hearts that they may find themselves and may come into knowledge of Home. [Personal references have been removed. For these, listen to the tape.]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We then take a look at Israel, Syria and Iran and take a look beyond that, to contrived contributions in upset by other parties and if we would take that away, we would see a resolution, as the majority of the people there wish for resolution. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We thank Wynn, Daphne and Terry so much for providing the opportunity and the open door for connection of the other side, our groups, the bringing of Home to each individual who listens and connects. We have tried so hard to connect to let people know that we hear their prayers. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Our connection is such a high frequency that it is sometimes hard to feel that one has connected when they pray, but we hear, we get it and we ally with you and the person praying, to help resolve their prayer into the highest good for all concerned and the most growth for the individuals involved in prayer. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We send Love-Light to truck drivers everywhere, to organic farmers everywhere who are bringing merchandise, foods to the people of the planet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We send Love-Light to each and every person that the individuals on the line or who are listening to a replay or reading a transcript may wish in their hearts to have healed, for them to have a better life. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">And we connect with the whales and the dolphins and send them support. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Adonai. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Wynn:</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>
